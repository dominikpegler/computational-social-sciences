sauerkraut and frankfurter

it be actually

we would love to go with you guy
versailles be beautiful i have to
see it gil it be perfect for you
with you obsession with les temp
perdus

nocturnal ablution








said with she usual
seductiveness




the studio adore you you be in
demand i do not think you want to
trade everything just to struggle




next day
the two couple be there and paul wax
pedantically as they tour the ground or inside

i believe louis moved he court
here in about originally
this be all swamp land in fact
if i be not mistaken in old french
the word versailles mean something
like terrain where the weed have
be pull
the main structure
be french classical style at it
height the work i believe of
louis le Vau i think Mansart and
charles lebrun i believe





i think i could get used to a
summer home like this

i too except remember in those
day they only have bath and i be
definitely a shower man

where be you two planning to live
after the wedding

little attic with a skylight in
paris




















i see
and no global warming no
or suicide bomb nuclear
weapon drug cartel

the usual menu of clich horror
story

nostalgia be denial
denial of the
painful present

he be a romantic
gil would be just
fine live in a perpetual state of
denial

the name for this fallacy be
called golden age think

touche

the erroneous notion that a
different time period be good
than the one one living in
it be a flaw in the romantic
imagination of those who find
coping with the present too
difficult





it be definitely the nice ring
we have see

i love a diamond wedding band
the
way it sparkle they will see it in
the last row when he put it on i
finger

fruity feel do not you agree

you will admit she be a sexy woman

this i have known for many year

i believe that love that be true and
real create a respite from death
all cowardice come from not loving
or not loving well which be the
same thing and when the man who be
brave and true look death squarely
in the face like some rhino hunter
i know or Belmonte who be truly
brave it be because they love with
sufficient passion to push death
out of they mind till it return
as it do to all man and then you
must make really good love again
think about it

distraction of the day i will
probably take another long walk
tonight

we will see
oh how about this




oh look at these wonderful glass
figure
as they be preoccupy gil be catch up by a woman who play
some old record on an old phonograph and she be playing
the cole porter tune cole be playing the other night

Vous aimez you like

coming out if realize
she be be talking to
he
huh

we should go
we be meeting paul
and carol for a private showing at
the museum

with the same sharp guide

it be a different museum and we
do not need a guide
pauls an
expert on monet





we can see all those beautiful
water lily at he home




paul carol inez and gil in circular room with huge Monets

the juxtaposition of color be
amazing
this man be the real
father of abstract expressionism
i take that back maybe turner

i prefer monet
i mean i love
turner but this be overwhelming

if i be not mistaken it take he two
year to complete this
and he
worked out at giverny where he
frequently

they say monet used to

shhh
i want to hear what pauls
saying

he be frequently visit by
Caillebotte an artist i
personally feel be underrate

i find monet almost too pretty
like renoir sometimes it be
cloying





coming to picassos
portrait of adriana
ah now here a superb picasso




gil be stun

if i be not mistaken he painted this
marvelous portrait of he french
mistress madeline Brissou in the
twenties

er i have to differ with you on
this one

really

gil pay attention and you will learn
something

if i be not mistaken this be a
fail attempt to capture a young
french girl named adriana from
bordeaux if i art history serve
i come to paris to study costume
design for the theatre
believe
she have a brief affair with
modigliani then braque that be
where pablo meet she er picasso
you would never know it from this
portrait but she be quite subtly
beautiful

what have you be smoking

and i would hardly call the picture
superb
it be more of a petit
bourgeoise statement of how pablo
er picasso see she see she he be
distract by the fact she be a
volcano in the sack




john helen and inez finishing fancy dinner

too rich for i




where do gil run off to

work he like to walk around
paris the way the city be all light
up at night allegedly inspire he
it be okay
paul and i be going
dance

where be carol

in bed with a bad oyster
see you later
thanks for dinner
dad
she exit

where do gil go every night

you hear she
he walk and get
idea

Uhhuh

you sound skeptical

i do not know
i see what he earn
but sometimes i think he be get a
part miss
and i do not like
he remark about tea party
republican
they be decent people
who want to take back the country
they be not cryptofascist airhead
zomby
do you hear he say
that

nevertheless i hardly think you
idea of have he follow be
practical





no
i would like to know where he go
every night

well we know one thing he do not
go dancing




gil dancing with a woman at Fitzgeralds party
he stop
finally and adriana wander over

hello again
how nice you be here

i be at gertrude steins she be
almost finished with i novel
and
the Fitzgeralds invited i over and
said you would be here you and pablo

Pablos home we have a bit of a
quarrel
but you look like you
be have fun dancing with djuna
barnes

that be djuna barnes
no wonder
she wanted to lead

be not this a wonderful place to
throw a party only the
Fitzgeralds would think of it
look this be from the turn of the
century
everything be so
beautiful then
hemingway coming over now
he squeeze adriana playfully
flirtatious

be not this little parisienne dream
a movable feast
mark i word
i be going to steal you from that
fugitive from malaga one way or the
other




refer to his
companion of the moment
















gil and adriana walk

i hope it be nothing serious with
you and pablo

he be moody and possessive
artist
be all like child

i understand why they all want to
paint you you be so damn
interesting to look at in a lovely
way

and you be interesting in a lose
way
tell i more about you book

i do not want to talk about i book
i want to enjoy paris by night

i keep forget you be only a
tourist

that be putting it mildly




adriana be showing he around

i can never decide whether paris be
more beautiful by day or by night

there be no book or paint or
symphony or sculpture that can
rival a great city
all these
street and boulevard as a special
art form




when you think in the cold
violent meaningless universe paris
exist these light i mean
nothing happening on jupiter or
neptune or out beyond but from
way out in space you can see these
light in the whole dark void the
cafe people drink and dancing
i mean for all we know this town be
the hot spot in the entire
universe

Vous avez ame daun poete

very unusual
indeed
in a way it be almost
science fiction fiction with all
the futuristic device television
set supersonic flight and yet
it be not typical science fiction
it be unique




nevertheless you have to get rid of
all that technology what be good
about you book be the character
the human question love
mortality nobody care about the
technology they care about the
human heart
we all fear death and
question we place in the universe
unfortunately you book lapse into
easy pessimism
i be have this
conversation with giacometti the
other day he be such a gloom
monger

still those sculpture

it be the artiste job not to
succumb to despair but to find an
antidote to the emptiness of
existence
i find you voice clear
and lively do not be such a
defeatist

customer shrug

gil with museum guide
she be translating the diary into

that paris exist and anyone could
choose to live anywhere else in the
world will always be a mystery to
i
turn page

dinner with pablo and henri
matisse
pablo be the great
artist although matisse be the
great painter




paris in the summer what it must
have be like to sit opposite
one lover at maxim in it be
heyday
page be torn and text cut off

i be in love with an american
writer i just meet named gil pender
he eye widen

that immediate magic one hear
about happen to i
i know that
both picasso and hemingway be in
love with i but for whatever
inexplicable reason the heart have
i be draw to gil
perhaps because
he seem naive and unassuming

as always in this sad life he be
about to marry a woman named inez
i have a dream where he come to i
and bring i a little gift
earring they be and we make
love
perhaps it be just as well i
accept hemingways offer to go to
africa
life with pablo be too
full of conflict and i be
suffocating under he genius
why
i need to go from one brilliant man
to another be i weakness
gil be
different perhaps not a genius but
not moody and selfish like pablo or
amedeo be
i think a trip to
africa with hemingway would help
get these feeling for gil off i
mind

i do not understand
what be this





it be a little complicate to
explain
thanks for translating

the writer clearly have feeling for
this man gil
that be you name
no

she find he no genius naive and
unassuming that be not exactly
dazzle

to some woman naivete be endearing
and she be romantic
she dream of
belle epoque paris and a gift of
earring and making love with this
man
gil stare think




gil be spruce up
he douse himself with aftershave
check clock
it be eleven

eleven let we see where the hell
be i going to get earring at this
hour
i must improvise
he go to Inezs jewelry box and pick out art nouveau
earring he know adriana would like
he grab a box and
gift wrap it quickly
maybe it come in a blue velvet box and he find some colored
paper
gil write card
to adriana with love
he cross
it out to adriana avec amour
he give a final check to himself and open door to leave
running smack into inez and both she parent home from they
trip prematurely

Vous devriez la presenter a
richard

he want degas to have you meet his
friend richard





he be looking for someone to do
costume for the ballet

ballet costume i god i do not
live here
i mean i do but i
do not
je nhabite pas ici

i would not get into too many
detail with they
let we just
leave it that we be temporarily
passing through

can i speak with you a minute
Permettezmoi de absenter un
instant
let we never go back to the
twenties

what be you talking about

i think we should stay here it be
the start of the belle epoque
this be the great most
beautiful era paris have ever known

but i love the jazz age

the twenties be full of strife and
uncertainty
but think of it gil
the two of we in a lovely art
nouveau home i will work in the
fashion world i love the style
you can write it be the age of
debussy and Guimard
maybe you can
meet balzac

but what happen to the twenties
and the charleston and cole porter

that be the present it be dull





it be not the present for i i be
from

what do you mean

i drop in on you just the way we
drop in on the s

you do

i wanted to escape i present just
like you wanted to escape yours
to a golden age

surely you do not think the twenties
be a golden age

to i they be

but i be from the twenties and i be
tellin you the golden age be the
belle epoque

yes but do not you see to these
guy the golden age be the
renaissance
they would all trade the
belle epoque to paint alongside
michelangelo or titian
and those
guy probably imagine life be
well when kubla khan be around
i be have an insight
minor one
but that account for the anxiety
of i dream

what dream

last night i dream i run out of
zithromax and then i go to the
dentist and there be no novacaine
these people have no antibiotic





what be you talking about

and even in the twenties no
dishwasher no if you
appendix burst no movie on
demand

but if we love each other what do
it matter when we live

because if you stay here and this
become you present sooner or
later you will imagine another time
be really the golden time
and so
will i i be beginning to see why
it can not work adriana
the
present have a hold on you because
it be you present and while there be
never any progress in the most
important thing you get to
appreciate what little progress
be make the internet Pepto
Bismol
the present be always
going to seem unsatisfying because
life itself be unsatisfying
that be why gauguin go back and
forth between paris and tahiti
searching it be i job as a writer
to try and come up with reason why
despite life be tragic and
unsatisfy it be still worth it

that be the problem with writer
you be all so full of word but
i be more emotional
i be going to
stay and live in paris most
glorious time
you make a choice
to leave paris once and you
regret it

yes that one i regret but it
be a real choice and i make the
wrong one
this be a choice
between accepting reality or
surreal insanity





so finally you do love inez more
than i

no i love you but this way lie
madness and if i be ever going to
write anything worthwhile i have get
to get rid of i illusion and that
i would be happy in the past be one
of they
