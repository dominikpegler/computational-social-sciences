longer
i think it be good
more
raw

well then maybe you should just
read the end

but it will not make any sense if you

so you do not want to hear i new
end

emotional too

and i mean really good word
choice

little of faulkner but east coast

embarrass
and those
adjective they be a little
flatfooted
and redundant
i be
sorry but
anyway what do i
know
do not even listen to what i
say
i mean

anyone else

catherine be right
the story a
piece of shit
you express nothing
but banality and formally
speak be unable to construct
a single compel sentence
you
ride on a wave of cliche so worn
in fact it actually approach a
level of grotesquerie
ad you
subtitle the rawness of truth
be that suppose to be a joke of
some sort
or be you just be
pretentious
beat
then checking he class book

be the rent high

again

nigger fuck i hard

again



freak

can i come in

you be all
sweaty


so john flip she around and
slam she against the wall
jane
brace herself
she think about
she mother
she think about
peter
she think about god
and
rape
say fuck i nigger
fuck i hard
johns flesh
abrade she soft skin
there would
be mark
she acquiesce and said
what he ask she to say and do
what he ask she to do
she have
entered college with hope with
dignity but she would graduate as
a whore


why do people have to be so
ugly
write about such ugly
character
it be pervert
i know
you all think i be be prisssy
but i do not care
i be bring up
in a certain way
and this
be
meanspirited

yeah well it do seem a little
affected
like by use taboo
language you be trying to shock
we about the hollowness of you
character

i think it be a little bit
racist

it be completely racist and
beyond that i feel deeply offended
as a woman
as if a woman can
only operate from experience of
objectification

totally phallocentric

and so weirdly misogynistic
i
mean why do jane go through
with this
be she stupid

hey but be not this a rape
or
do i miss something
because i
i be confuse
because if this
be a rape then why would she be
a whore

it be confessional yet
dishonest
jane pretend to be
horrify by the sexuality that
she in fact fetishizes
she
subsume herself to the myth of
black male potency but then
do not follow through
she think
she respect AfroAmericans she
think they be acool exotic
what a notch he would make in she
belt but of course it all come
down to mandingo cliche and he
call she on it
in classic racist
tradition she demonizes then run
for cover
but then how could she
behave otherwise
she be just a
spoil suburban white girl with a
benneton rainbow complex
it be
just i opinion and what do i
know
but i think it be a callow
piece of write

callow and coy
jane want more
but be not honest enough to admit
it
in the end she return to the
safety of she cripple
translation
sexually impotent
boyfriend

this be bullshit
she story be
the truth

right

it be unbelievable

it be clich

it be disgusting

but it happen

i do not know about what
happen vi because once you
start writing it all become
fiction
still it certainly be an
improvement over you last story
there be now at least a begin
a middle and an end



hello

hello be this pam

do you have any brother or

yes

really
how many

four brother and five sister

wow

it be god will

but do you really believe in god
and heaven hell and angel and
all kind of stuff

no

so
how be school today

the same

the same
same as what

just the same

we be study the holocaust in
social study

oh yeah

we do the same thing last year
also

how be the class

well i be suppose to watch
Schindlers list for homework
the
movie like almost four hour
and then i be suppose to write a
report on survivor
you know any survivor dad

hmmm
do i know
any
personally

well technically you Zeda be a
survivor

he be in a concentration camp

well no
but he have to escape the
nazi

but i think he come over to
america before the war

well he do
with he family
but
he cousin they have to stay and
they be all killed
and if he would
stay he would have be killed
so in i book he be a survivor

even though it be only he
cousin that be killed

but that could have happen to he
or to i if i would be alive
or
you

or i

you mean then we be all
survivor

well
yes
if it have not be for
hitler he would not have have to
leave europe
we would have
be
european

but then in a sense since you
would never have meet dad if you
family have stay in europe
if
it be not for hitler none of we
would have be born

get the hell outta here

man it be just like
conversation

tell i
you make a live at
this

well sir
uh
i be actually not
do this for the money
when you
make a documentary you do it for
many reason but money be
certainly not one of they

i do not get it

well sir a lot have happen to
the landscape of the suburban high
school since i be a student and
i feel it would be a valuable
perhaps even enlightening
endeavor to chronicle the
change to get intimate with the
reality kid and parent face in
american school today

yeah well whatever
i will let you
know if there be interest

excuse i where be the bathroom

you a pervert

no
actually i be a documentary
filmmaker

oh
you mean like blair witch
project

well no
i be do one on high
school student in fact

what for

well
it be kind of a sociological
study in the aftermath of
columbine

be this to like get into sundance

yeah well it be possible they
would be interest in it

doubt it

actually there be some interest
from the sundance channel

whoopee

and have also show some
interest

so you have connection



you see we be trying to do a film
on suburban lifestyle

kind of an american family for
the new millennium

i think this be about kid
get into college

oh it be
i mean

which be it
you get to keep you
focus straight

you be absolutely right
the focus
be on the college admission
process today

and you want scooby to be the
focus of all this

scooby and a few other student of
different socioeconomic
background

oh well i do not have they yet
but

either scooby be the focus or
forget it

yeah i think i be the focus

i want to be the focus

toby we need this to be a
positive experience

well i suppose i could
reconceive

Reconceive

because scooby do have a quality
that i have be looking for a
quality that be emblematic of
american today
it be part
disillusionment part hope

Twinkeys

boy take napkin
napkin

not to be crass but what do we
get out of this

do not worry he do not mean
money

oh i know i know that
well
sharing you story you up and
down and so
forth can i hope be an
illuminate experience

yeah
how do we know we will not be
exploited

no it be true

mr livingston i fully understand
and i share you concern
you
fell vulnerable
and i know that
this be a very difficult question
but what it come down to be
can
you make a leap of faith in i in
the same way that i have to make a
leap of faith in you

this be a great school
i do not
care what anybody say
i mean
it be not perfect but like the
people be really cool like the
teacher and kid
they really
care and all
and i know that they
make fun of new jersey all the
time but i do not care
because
they be just snob
because jersey
be where americas at



walk down these hallway just
like the one i once walk down
as a teenager i could not help
think back to a time when every
day i wake up depress suicidal
consume by despair
have thing
changed
be the competition to
get into the most prestigious
school still a requisite rite of
passage
beneath these mask of
courtesy and friendliness i know
that there be dark force at
work
and i know that scooby be
the key to revealing the truth



scooby scooby scooby
what be
you think
college sat you
parent you brother you
friend
how be it you deal with
all this stress


the pressure to get into the
college of you choice be
incredible
you know they do a
study recently of the youth in
bosnia during the bomb and
they find that the stress the
young people experienced there be
less than what american high
school student go through when
apply to college



be that right


yes



oh i god

so whaddya think

well i be not really sure what
you be trying to say
it be funny
i suppose
but it seem glib and
facile to just make fun of how
idiotic these people be

i be not making fun
i be showing it
as it really be

you be showing how superior you
be to you subject

no but i like i subject
i like
these people

no you do not

yes i do

let we go guy
let we do it

when i be in high school i be not
going to play any football
i be
just going to concentrate on class
rank
what do you do in high school

i do not go to high school

be not there high school in el
salvador

we have to work
i family be
poor

must have be hard be poor

i be still poor

hmmm
but consuelo even though you
poor do not you have any hobby
or interest or anything

no mikey

but like what do you like to do
when you be not working

i be always work

but when you be not
like now
what do you like to do

this be work

but it be not like real work
this
be just babysit

you know you job really not so
bad if you think about it
you
should smile more often



when the sky be clear and the sun
be warm you be remind of how
beautiful thing can be
a lamp
post a sign a straw wrapper
blowing in the wind
but when that
dark cloud appear you realize
how fragile the balance of life
be

when brady first arrive at the
hospital he be unresponsive to
verbal stimulus
wee perform a
scan which demonstrated a large
subdural hemotoma with mass
effect
since the removal of the
subdural he be be in coma

when i first meet the Livingstons
it be in the first twenty four
hour of brady coming in after his
tragic football accident and they
be acting in a fairly typical
way

we be not the one who need the
help
i son need help

and you

i sones in there
he can not even
feed himself he can not eat i
do not even know if he be going to
be a vegetable or not for
chrissake



but what about scooby
how would
this effect he
what meaning be
to be find in this

this be definitely good

you think so
you do not think that
this might not be a little dry

this be entertainment you be
making toby
this story about a
kid in the suburb and the state
of the college admission process
have with this brady crisis
evolved into something much rich
and more provocative

yes i know
but still it should
be somewhat entertain

i mean without this footage
without this rigorous
documentation it would feel
like exploitation

no no no
no exploitation
this
be serious
but do not you find it a
little funny too at the same
time

you have get a family tragedy on
you hand
will you tell i
what be funny about that
about a
kid in a coma

nothing i guess

i mean why be you making this
documentary if you can not treat
you subject with appropriate
gravity

you be right you be right
you know we need to screen what
we have get
invite some regular
people just some random offthe
street type
and see what real
people think of this

i dunno toby
we really have a
long way to go
you still need a
lot more footage and it be
probably a little premature to
start screen

then we can invite serious
intellectual type

we be not ready

hip alternative type who will
understand the process well

we be not ready

well i need to see this with an
audience

what be an audience going to tell
you

i do not know
maybe they will like
it

consuelo
i spilled some grape
juice on the floor
consuelo

consuelo

consuelo
be you crying

no

yes you be
i can tell
what be
the matter

mi jesus

but why be you so
upset about jesus

he be dead

oh
how do it happen

he be executed
he be on death
row and then he be executed

how do they execute he

poison gas

maybe it be for the good
i mean if
he be guilty of do something
wrong
people who be bad should be
killed
do not you think so

jesus be not bad

maybe he be and you just do not
know it

he be not

but still you can not be sure

i be sure

but really you never know

i know

why be he on death row

for rape and murder

consuelo what be rape exactly

it be when you love someone and
they do not love you
and then you
do something about it

sometimes i feel like i parent
do not love i

well then when you get old you
can do something about it

consuelo
i spilled some grape
juice upstairs
do you think you
could clean up the floor now

dad
do you think that brady will
ever get good

one in a million recover

maybe he be that one in a million

mikey there be optimism and then
there be stupidity

fine line

you feel good
