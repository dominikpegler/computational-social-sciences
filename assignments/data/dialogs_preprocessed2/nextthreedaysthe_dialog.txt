it be a robbery
someone steal she

scene she have the victim blood on
she clothe she fingerprint on the
murder weapon

be this a bad joke

how do you
do that after you kill somebody
she would have to be a psychopath

and the fight in the office

everyone fight with they boss

but this one end up dead

saying that

i will find someone to file the
pleading

sure












so what be it about
julie

that belief in someone virtue be
more important than virtue itself

no
i mean yes that be in there
but what be it about

it be about how rational thought
destroy the soul
it be about the
triumph of irrationality and the
power that be in it










it be a course that investigate what
drive man to be free no matter the
cost

somebody else have dibs on papillon

you escaped from jail seven time

no smoke

yeah who would want to cut short
you precious life

mind if i tape you

go for it it can not be used as
evidence
what do you want to know

how you escaped when no one else
could

ball and a little luck
no prison in the world be airtight
each one have a key
you have to
find it

how do you do that

lot of looking
especially at
thing that break the daily routine
guard get comfortable do the
same thing every day
something
happen where they have to think
adapt




that be when they will make mistake
but when you see it you have to be
ready
you have to have the entire
plan already in place before you
even know how you be going to get
out of the jail
escape be easy
the hard part
be staying free





you have to know where you be going
to go and how you be going to get
there
you have to know how they
plan to catch you where and when



how the hell do you know that



you pay off someone who know
and
a lot depend on if the prison be in
the country or the city



the city

where be you from

pittsburgh

pittsburgh be tough
so many bridge
and tunnel they can block off








from the time they make the call
the police can have the center of
the city sealed tight in fifteen
minute



how can they be so exact

after homeland security make
every city have a lockdown plan
downtown pittsburgh philly boston
minneapolis fifteen minute
they can do in under ten





within thirtyfive minute they will
have cop at every tollbooth on the
interstate



and be running roll stop on the
secondary road
they will not have
you photograph yet but they will
have you description





what if you can not make it out



Thirtyfive minute be not a lot of
time

then surrender




because they will shoot you on sight
along with anyone you be with





stay far away from the train and bus
station



forget the local airport
leave
from another state





second
identity
it be easy to find
fake paper harder to find one
that will get you through an airport





you will need a passport driver
license and a social security number



if you have to rent a car find a
place that will take a cash deposit
they will still run a credit check so
use a real persona name on the
third
destination








you want somewhere that do not
attract american tourist and do not
get american newspaper
think yemen
and you get the idea



then money





you need a truck load of it
Everythings expensive
hotel
travel information



how much

enough to last at least fivesix
year
run out of money and you run
out of friend





but before you do anything you have
to ask yourself if you can do it
can you forget about ever seeing
you parent again
can you kill a
guard leave you kid at a gas
station push a nice old lady to the
ground because she be between you
and the door
because to do this
thing that be who you have to become
and if you can not do not start because
you will just get someone killed






how do you get catch



i give myself up
i could not take
wonder when someone be going to
come through the bedroom door
get what you need

yeah

what do you have in you pocket
