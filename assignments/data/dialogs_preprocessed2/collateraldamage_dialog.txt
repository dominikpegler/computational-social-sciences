thing like this




you interested in the big picture
or all the unpleasant detail

i family die because of what be
going on down there
i want to
know all i can

well basically the situation in
colombia suck




the government be fighting
different marxist faction for
over thirtyfive year
for most
of that time it be winning




suddenly the guerrilla begin
chopping they up
hightech
weapon and equipment well
train troop aggressive hit
andrun tactic all finance by
extortion kidnap and
collecting tax from dope
grower
it be big money and they
put it to use





the government get scare
in
to jump start peace talk
it give a coalition of guerrilla
group temporary control over much
of southern colombia
the first
communist stronghold on an
american continent




but there be few talk
and no peace
and the colombian
military can not get near the
guerrilla zone especially around
the town of Caguan where the



kick ass and take no
prisoner




and that be where we come in
supposedly to help eliminate
narcos operating in the guerrilla
zone
but some wellinformed
people think that be just an excuse
to hit the guerrilla themselves
since they be wrapped around the
drug trade
we be there we be
involve
if we stay the only
real question be which vietnam war
we be going to have
the one some
feel we could have win or the one we
lost

they reach the land cruiser

but now we have to see the


supervisor for Caguan
it be a prospect that seem to concern felix almost as
much as gordy
off which as they get into the toyota


the for Caguan may be a marxist but the
clean wellordered office be nicely appointed with a
bigscreen sony and leather furniture
the tvs

photo on the wall depict he as a young man
wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an patch and
holding an
brass nameplate read supervisor
rest on a neat desk behind which stand the man himself
a hardened former guerrilla fighter proud of his
position
he be not in cammies now he uniform now
consist of casual but nice tropical clthe and a fat
rolex
felix be a subordinate here
he and gordy stand across
the desk as the supervisor examine Gordys travel pass
Gordys nervous about what could appear on the in the
b
g

gordy peer out the window intently as they drive
looking for a lucky break looking for the wolf
searching the face of every man
he do not see the
wolf but what he do see surprise he
the
supervisor be right
Caguans no Mompos

world town arm troop be visible and there be a lot
of bad shit behind Colombias revolutionary but here

in a thick foulsmelling liquid

we be use portable to keep
production going but they do not
supply enough power to the heat
lamp and we have to dry a lot
of
coffee bean


they be now walking between the two row of shed where

this direction
gordy rummage through the refuse lying around the room
we see some rubber tubing
we see some rope
gordy
finally find a piece of sharp metal
he move to the
wall with the window
with the covering the
noise gordy start chiseling away at the adobe


the bigwheeled guerrilla suburban drive in


gordy be making slow progress through the wall when he

he aim the stream at the hole
thumb the end of the hose to make the water jet even
harder
and watch the jet begin eating away at the
old adobe and brick just as it eat through the crumble
plaster in the spanish harlem tenement


the beaten man finish with felix
felix begin lead
the guerrilla toward the storeroom


Gordys make progress but have not broken through yet
and he will not not in enough time
under he breath

come on baby

and just then


one of the gordy repaired suffer
a spectacularly loud internal breakdown
the heat light
dim in a row of shed
felix and the guerrilla stop to
see what be happening
at which point the generator now

just in time
and we realize that he would planned on the diversion as
the water jet break through
the hole still small
gordy begin to widen it



felix the beaten man and the other guerrilla resume
they march toward the storeroom
they reach the storeroom

the guerrilla report to the beaten man
they can not find
gordy
to the man guard the plantation

keep looking
he signal he man to come with he
they get into the
suburban
whereupon we

Gordys hanging onto the chassis
with the large tire
and high groundclearance there be just enough room to
get he leg over the rear axle
he be just finishing
rig up a rope he take from the store room the
rope sling from one side of the chassis to the other
to support Gordys back
he hear the
grab the transfer case and


off with gordy suspended below
the rear madly inch from Gordys
face
and with each bump in the road even with heavy
duty offroad shock and spring the undercarriage of
the suburban come within inch of crush Gordys
leg
be everywhere
the dirt and the
dust be choking
even for a short distance it be going
to be a long dangerous ride


as the down back road and through the
darken town

continue to suffer underneath
even with the rope
support he he have to hold on with two hand
vicious jolt suddenly loosen a grenade
it start to
slip free
gordy can not stop it without letting go
the
grenade fall and
gordy shoot out a hand and grab it
barely
the spoon
just hanging on the end of he fingertip
gordy can not
use he other hand to get it
he need the hand to hold
onto the car
the grenade begin to slip
he be going to
lose it
and just as it fall
gordy do the only thing left
he slip a finger
through the loop of the grenade pin
just barely snag
the grenade before it drop to the road
and then
carefully slowly praying that each bump do not jar
the grenade off the pin with he other arm shaking and
screaming in pain as he maintain a grip on the transfer
case gordy ease the grenade back onto he stomach
where he get a good grip
jam the grenade back
then grab onto the undercarriage once more in time to
relieve the muscletearing strain on he arm

the suburban pass the cine
the movie over just
letting out


the suburban pull up to the wellguarded house gordy see
the night before
the man get out and go inside leaving
the clearly planning to leave again
right away


carefully lower himself to the ground
slide out on
the side away from the house
hide behind a large
wheel
the brightlylit house be surround by coconut
tree
gordy watch the guard
when the guard be not
looking he run to the near tree
the sound of the
cover he footstep

gordy move from tree to tree when the guard be not
looking when he reach one tree and


coconut hit the ground next to he and
one of the guard come to investigate
the guard get close
gordy inch around the tree
he
can not get away without be see
he nudge the coconut
with he toe
nudge it harder cause it slowly to
roll away and
the guard pick it up
never see gordy in the shadow of
the tree pressed against the trunk
the guard show the
coconut to a guard near the house then walk back

sneak to another tree
then reach the house
he
move to a window
peer into a room
no one there
but we hear the sound of
gordy creep along the
wall
look into another room and

be a group of guerrilla including the beaten man
packing suitcase etc
leaving in a hurry

scan the face
except for the beaten man no face be
familiar
man with he we stand and there be
nothing familiar about he either
when

directly in front of we another man emerge from a room
he be also in guerrilla camo



gordy looking intently at the man

the face of the cop outside the consulate

in the room
he face loom large as he
we

when he bump into gordy on
th street

in the room
it be the same face

he be find the wolf when
suddenly a guard appear and
gordy freeze
ease into the shadow
he dirty face
and clothes blend in just enough
the guard move past

when the coast be clear gordy move to the large propane
tank
he take out the grenade
put the rubber band
around it spoon and all
grip the grenade in he hand
holding the spoon down and yank the pin
and then
slowly slowly gordy begin release he grip allow
the rubber band to take on the pressure of the spring
load spoon
if they will do it
if the spoon go now
Gordys going up in the blast
gordy continue to relax he grip
the rubber band
stretch
stretch more
keep stretching until they be
barely holding the spoon
but they be holding it
gordy quickly carefully wire the grenade to the propane
tank
then take out the zippo pull it apart and
remove the light fluidsoaked cotton
hold the
cotton just above the grenade and squeeze with his
finger
and



lighter fluid drop onto the rubber band
gordy
squeeze out as much as he can onto they
then gordy get the hell out of there
he find cover
duck down
and wait

the light fluid be dissolving the rubber band

gordy suddenly hear a woman gentle
he look
in the direction of the sound and
gordy see the attractive woman and the boy approaching
on the road
she be singing a gentle song in spanish
Gordys eye flash with alarm
he glance at the house

the light fluid continue dissolving the rubber band
which be now beginning to lose they elasticity and
stretch from the pressure of the spoon

gordy look back at the woman and boy closer now
walking toward the house
