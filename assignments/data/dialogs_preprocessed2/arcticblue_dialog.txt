sitting in this plane and they be
down there blowing i kiss

be driving long

i needed a pilot license to
take the job here so i get one
in six week

that make the flight more
interesting

see the blood
pack of wolf
take down a moose
greedy
gutripping son of bitch
i would
kill the last wolf on earth
right in front of the president
of the you

stink cowardly
predator the wolf

sound like professional
jealousy

hunting and trap be a damn
fine life
i and mitchell bob and LeMalle
we be team
i would always go
with mitchell
good man
mitchell
i would let bob worry
about goddamn LeMalle
we would hire
a plane in october
on the way
to a dirt airstrip somewhere
we would drop supply
we would land
tell the pilot to come back for
we a few day before christmas

the idea be to get to the
supply before the bear do
along the route we would set we
trap
make we year living in
three month

lot of time we do not even have
a land strip
we would set down
on a plateau like that one
there
yeah that one easy
you could glide right in

hope you get you money worth
on those lesson

stay put

you get the belly to look i in
the eye and pull the trigger

be no different than shooting a
rabid dog

next time you want to kill
yourself do not include i

i take the odds on get down
in one piece and i make it
now
we be in i territory

with light clthe and no
supply this be nobody
territory

mountain
