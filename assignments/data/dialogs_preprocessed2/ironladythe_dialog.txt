i be sure we will manage

i have always preferred the company
of man

ma


ah miss roberts
hope to be
chosen as we candidate for
parliament

well i do not like coalition
never have

start on the outside

and work you way in


attlee have he sight set on
the steel industry you mark i
word

they will be nationalize the
bloody air next

yes hold you breath sir that be
government property

so be you father a political
man too miss roberts

oh yes to he core
and mayor of
grantham

and a grocer as well

yes

and do you help err in
the
shop

oh yes
it be a family business

very good start point for the
political life i be sure

that and a degree from oxford


hush aside to

whisky

what i do think be that a man
should be encourage to stand on
he own two foot
yes we help
people of course we help people
but for those that can do they
must just get up and do
and if
something wrong they should not
just whine about it they should
get in there and something
about it change thing

with all due respect miss
roberts what may have serve in
grantham

can serve very well for the people
of dartford too

really

i know much more than those who
have never live on a limit
income
just like the man or woman
on the street when i be short one
week i have to make economy the
next

nothing like a slice of fiscal
responsibility


man might call it fiscal
responsibility a woman might call
it good housekeeping

i be not sure a home economics
lesson be quite what the dartford
constituent need
they see
industry be nationalize the
union on the up the pound on the
slide
whoever can sort that lot
out he be i man

or woman

lady shall we

miss roberts do join the lady

deal with this if you would be

we be just talking about they

no uhm yes we have always
live alongside evil
but it have
never be so patient so avid for
carnage so eager to carry
innocent with it into oblivion

so would you

western civilization must root out
this evil wherever it hide or
she risk defeat at the hand of
global terror in a nuclear age
unimaginable

mrs thatcher
airey neave
welcome to the madhouse
follow
i


the right honourable lady the
secretary of state for education

the right honourable gentleman
know that we have no choice but
to shut down the school

because he union paymaster have
called a strike deliberately to
cripple we economy
teacher
cannot teach when there be no
heat no light in they
classroom
and i ask the
honourable gentleman whose fault
be that

Methinks the right honourable lady
do screech to much
if she want
we to take she seriously she must
learn to calm down

if the right honorable gentleman
could perhaps attend more closely
to i be saying rather than
i be saying it he may receive
a valuable education in spite of
himself

why have this conservative
government failed
why have it
forced so many in the public
sector into taking strike action
to save they own job


minister the breakdown of
essential public service
transport electricity sanitation
be not the fault of the trade
union but of this conservative
government in which you so
shamefully serve

so these power cut will continue
unless we can reach a compromise

the miner be asking for a
increase in wage
obviously we
can not go anywhere near that
the
union be not we enemy and
never have be
we want and
have always wanted the broad
consensus

i be sure we be all in agreement
that we must do nothing for the
moment that will **further/far inflame
the current situation

hear hear prime minister


the fact of the matter be it be
absolutely crucial that we be
see by the public to be acting as
conciliator and not aggressor
finally
acknowledge
margaret
yes education secretary

yes

prime minister with the miner
leader calling today for the army
to mutiny in support of the
strike this seem the wrong time
for conciliation

be patient
they will come back on
in a minute

thank you margaret

you thought be duly noted



we on this island be strong
we be selfreliant
napoleon
called we a nation of shopkeeper


he mean it as an insult but to i
it be a compliment
that be why he
could not beat we and that be why
hitler can not beat we

we conservative believe in giving
people the freedom and opportunity
to fulfil they own potential
especially the young
there be no
good in pretend we be all
equal we be not all the same
never have be never will be
we
should encourage we child to
aspire to achieve more than we
have for we child today will
be the leader of tomorrow

it be and you would think it be

blackout no petrol
it be a
mess
heath should resign now and
make way for someone who be not
afraid to tackle the union

i swear it be all go completely
out of i head
i drive
instructor think i should pass
but i feel as if i have hardly have
any lesson
ridiculous be not it
maybe third time lucky

right
the only thing you should
remember be that everyone else be
either reckless or inept
and
often both


one must be brave if one be to
take the wheel

righto

move over
move to you right a
little bit

but if i move to the right be not
i on the wrong side of the road

carol

well he be in the way

to the right
move to the right

so sorry
terribly sorry

hey look at i driving

thanks ma that be terrific
i
really feel i have get a handle on
it now

you should have see we pa


have you be trying to make
breakfast
for goodness sake
denis

i can boil a bloody egg

mummy take i for a test drive
we go absolutely everywhere
all
over the place

i have decided
i be going to run

what for

i be going to run for leader of the
party

silly i

good luck



all the time i think i be
have a drive lesson it be
all about i mother just for a
change

what be she on about

it be she drive test this
morning


oh right
of course

be you saying you want to be
prime minister

what i be saying be that someone
must force the point say the
unsayable
none of these man have
the guts

the prime minister have be very
loyal to you

but he be weak and he be weakened
the party
one must know when to
go
you be shaking

i can do it

goodness i
what be the matter
with everyone this morning

i have tell you what the matter be
the business be a bit rocky at the
moment and the doctor think i
need a rest

and do you need a rest


we both know that it be highly
unlikely that i would ever be
elected leader i will never be
elected leader
but i will run
i
will run
just to nip at they
heel and make they reaffirm the
principle on which the
conservative party must stand
there be so much to do

you be insufferable margaret do
you know that

denis you married someone who be
committed to public service you
know that
and it be i duty

do not call it duty
it be ambition
which have get you this far
ambition
and the rest of we i
the child we can all go to
hell



do not worry about i i will be
fine

where do you go

south africa

yes




how many day passed before you
realized i be go
probably have
to ask the clean woman where i
be

when do i lose track of everyone

too busy climbing the greasy pole




mrs thatcher i understand you
recently visit the united states
of america

what be it you take away from
that visit which may be of value
here in great britain

oh that be rather easy to answer
actually
they be unafray of
success


we in great britain and in europe
be form mainly by we history
they on the other hand be form
by they philosophy
not by what
have be but by what can be
oh
we have a great deal that we can
learn from they yes
oh yes

well er
for a start that hat
have get to go
and the pearl
in
fact i think all hat may have to
go
you look and sound like a
privilege conservative wife and
we have already get she vote
you have
get lovely hair but we need to do
something with it to make it
more

important

yes
give it more impact
but the
main thing be you voice
it too
high
it have no authority

Methinks the lady do screech too
much

people do not want to be harangue
by a woman or hectore
persuade
yes
that oh yese at the end of
the interview that be
authoritative that be the voice of
a leader


it be all very well to talk about
changing i voice mr reece but
for some of i colleague to
imagine i as they leader would
be like imagine i do not know
be lead into battle by they
chambermaid
it be i background
and i sex
no matter how i have
tried and i have tried to fit
in i will never be truly one of
they

if i may say so i think that be
you trump card
you be flying in
the face of everything the tory
have be thus far
it be really
very exciting
one simply have to
maximise you appeal bring out
all you quality and make you
look and sound like the leader
that you could be

you have get it in you to go the
whole distance

absolutely

prime minister
oh no
oh no no
no
in britain
there will be no
female prime minister here not in
i lifetime
no
and i told airey
i do not expect to win the
leadership but i be going to run
just to shake up the party

respectfully margaret i
disagree
if you want to change
this party lead it
if you want
to change the country lead it
what we be talking about here
today be surface
what be crucial
be that you hold you course and
stay true to who you be
never be
anything other than yourself


leave we to do the rest

gentleman i be in you hand
i
may be persuade to surrender the
hat
but the pearl be a gift
from i husband on the birth of
we twin and they be absolutely
nonnegotiable

and
bring it down

Maaaaaaaaaaaa

good i think we can loose the
handbag mrs thatcher
hand down
the side
because this be not
really about the voice it be about
belief
nice deep breath

if you be calling mr thatcher how
would you do that

denis

yes i want more authority i want
conviction i want


a little more
authority
denis

that be right one more time deep
breath

denis

yes

you be the backbone of we
nation
small firm like Lovedays
ice cream
how be you
so nice to
meet you lady

i will just have a small one
because i be watch i figure
hand the cone
out
that be for you young man



i passionately believe it be the
growth of small business into
large one that be critical for
britain future


it have to be something icy on a
stick for denis

that be the only way we will
produce job real job job that
sustain

the trade union movement be
found to protect worker
now it
persecute they
it stop they
from working
it be killing job
and it be bringing this country to
it knee
i say enough
it be time
to get up
it be time to go to
work
it be time to put the great
back into great britain


give em hell

you look magnificent
next stop
prime minister

oh airey

the leader of the conservative
party margaret thatcher


good night margaret
i money on
the filly to win

oh thank airey
goodnight

no
no no
airey


the irish national liberation army
have claim responsibility for the
death of airey neave margaret
thatchers spokesman on northern
ireland



if you want to change the party
lead it




if you want to change the country
lead it
you have get it in you to
go the whole distance

now as the test draw near i ask
you help

leak geoffrey they be bay
for we blood

michael we can not possibly buckle
at the first sign of difficulty

no one be saying we have to
buckle

but be this really the time to
make these spend cut in the
middle of one of the deep
recession this country have ever
experience

we need a plan of action
margaret

absolutely
strategy


we must be armed

agreed

there be a perception margaret
rightly or wrongly that we be
now completely out of touch with
the country

really
how much be a pack of lurpak

lurpak

butter francis
forty two pence
anchor butter be
forty pence

still the cheap be thirty
eight pence
i can assure you i be
not out of touch

what do you say

nothing
nothing prime minister


do not try to hide you opinion
goodness i i would much rather you

mortgage

the manufacture industry be
practically on it knee

honest hardworking decent
people be losing they home

the point be prime minister that
we must moderate the pace

if we be even to have a hope of
winning the next election

quite right

ah
worried about we career be
we

gentleman if we do not cut
spending we will be bankrupt
yes
the medicine be harsh but the
patient require it in order to
live
shall we withhold the
medicine
no
we be not wrong
we
do not seek election and win in
order to manage the decline of a
great nation


the people of this country choose
we because they believe we can
restore the health of the british
economy and we will do just that
bar a failure of nerve

anything else

thank you
you saved the day once
again Crawfie you be an angel

you can not close down a discussion
because it be not what you wish to
hear

i do not expect everyone just to
sit there and agree with i
but
what kind of leader be i if i
do not try to get i own way to
do what i know to be right

yes
but margaret one must be
careful of testing one
colleague loyalty too far



we be now one split nation with
a huge gulf divide the employ
from the unemployed




the thatcher plan be to break the
trade union movement



there must be closure of
uneconomic coal mine we seek
only an efficient industry



the miner be be starved back
to work the need be desperate



there be those who would say hold
back there be those who would
make we retreat

but we shall never give in to
they
we shall never waver not
for a second in we determination
to see this country prosper once
again

the falkland island the british
colony in the south atlantic have
fallen
argentina claim it
marine go ashore this morning
as a spearhead to capture key
target including the capital
port stanley

gentleman the argentinian junta
which be a fascist gang have
invaded we sovereign territory
this cannot be tolerate
may i
make plain i negotiate
position
i will not negotiate
with criminal or thug
the
falkland island belong to
britain and i want they back
gentleman i need you to tell i
today if that be possible


possible
just prime minister
we can have a task force ready to
sail in fortyeight hour

Fortyeight hour

but

but

we have a very narrow weather
window
we can not fight in winter
down there
nobody can
if we be
going we have to go now

why be the island left without
any naval protection

in the last round of defence cut
we judge the risk of invasion to
be small

do we

and if you remember prime
minister you agreed that we
should reduce the naval presence
in the area to an absolute
minimum


margaret the cost of sending
man and a hundred ship
twelve thousand mile almost to
argentina will be absolutely
cripple

i do not think we should be
worrying about money at this
point geoffrey

we can not afford to go to war



we have to go now



the government have now decided
that a large task force will sail
as soon as all preparation be
complete



prime minister we do still have
three week before we ship reach
the island



all we be saying be that we
should not give up on trying to
find a diplomatic solution


the you

secretary of state have
arrive prime minister

so you be propose to go to war
over these island
they be
thousands of mile away a handful
of citizen politically and
economically
insignificant if
you will excuse i

just like hawaii i imagine

i be sorry

when japan attacked pearl
harbour
do america go cap in
hand and ask tojo for a peaceful
negotiation of term
do she turn
she back on she own citizen there
because the island be thousands
of mile from mainland united
states
no no no
we will stand
on principle or we shall not stand
at all

but margaret with all due respect
when one have be to war

with all due respect sir i have
do battle every single day of i
life and many man have
underestimated i before
this lot
seem bound to do the same but they
will rue the day

now shall i be mother


tea al how do you take you tea
black or white

the argentinian ship the general
belgrano and she escort be
pursue course degree toward
the argentinian mainland
we be
tracking it with we submarine
conqueror

be this ship a threat

both of these ship be carrying
exocet missile prime minister
just yesterday they launch then
abort an attack inside the
exclusion zone
there be a risk
they could try it again

the belgrano be sailing directly
away from the island
can it
really be regarded as a threat

she be be changing course
continually
there be a strong
possibility that they be
attempting a pincers movement on
we carrier group


i advise that we engage they
hit
the belgrano as a warn to the
other
send they all back to
port

it will play badly internationally
we will be see as aggressor

this will be an escalation prime
minister

if there be to be an escalation
it be good that we start it

it be steaming away prime
minister

sink it



sheffield a type
destroyer be attack and hit
late this afternoon by an
argentine missile



it be see as a retaliation for
the sink of the general
belgrano in which over
argentinian sailor die

prime minister

late casualty figure from the
sheffield

i must write to they

prime minister

the family
i must write to
they

foreign secretary

i have just be brief by admiral
fieldhouse


he told i bluntly that if the
argentinian be prepared and
will to risk they aircraft
they have enough missile to
cripple most of we fleet

president reagan and president
Bellaunde of peru have some new

going to write to every single one

soldier will die in vain for the
falklands

lieutenant colonel jones
captain

Farlaine
corporal hardman
corporal sullivan
corporal briar



as the only prime minister in the
history of we country who be also
a mother with a son of i own i
can imagine you agony and you
grief



prime minister we have secured
the beachhead



the argentinian troop be
demoralized and i will equip
the
paratroop have taken goose
green


shortly after dark last night we
force executed what we commander
in chief have called a brilliant
surprise night attack

thatcher bed

from they new position we
force can see large number of
argentine soldier retreating and
streaming back into port stanley
we force be moving forward to
exploit they success

well do


we congratulate the man and woman
of the arm force for they
skill bravery and loyalty to this
country

we be face with an act of
unprovoked aggression and we
respond as we have respond in
time past
with unity strength
and courage sure in the knowledge
that though much be sacrifice in
the end right will prevail over
wrong

and i put it to the honourable
member opposite that this be not a
day for he to carp find fault
demand inquiry they will happen
i can assure he of that for we
have nothing to hide no this be
a day to put difference aside
hold one head high and take
pride in be british


well that paid off old
girl
you rating soar
from
the most hate prime minister of
all time to the nation
darling
the world be at you
foot and britain be back in
business


the berlin wall have fallen
the
gate have open
the police be
making no attempt to stop people
as they go through

i do not agree in any measure

but prime minister the question of
the european single currency will
come up

i do not think the country be ready
for it yet


but we cannot bury we head in
the sand



lot of conservative mps and
minister be saying

that there must be a change in
that style of management
that mrs
thatcher must listen more and on
occasion give in



the point be prime minister i
do not think we can sell the idea
of a tax that ask everyone to pay
the same



we policy may be unpopular but
they be the right policy



prime minister i just do not think
we can ask the poor of the poor
to pay the same amount of tax as a
multimillionaire

there it be again
why not


because

because people
on the whole
think that the tax be manifestly
unfair

nonsense
arrant nonsense
this
be a simple proposition
in order
to live in this country you must
pay for the privilege something
anything
if you pay nothing you
care nothing
what do you care
where you throw you rubbish
you
council estate be a mess you
town graffiti what do you care
it be not you problem it be
somebody else problem it be the
government problem
problem
be some of you be that you
have not get the courage for this
fight
you have not have to fight
hard for anything
it be all be
given to you and you feel guilty
about it
well may i say on
behalf of all those who have
to fight they way up and who
do not feel guilty about it we
resent those slacker who take
take take and contribute nothing
to the community

and i see the same thing the same
cowardice in we fight within the
european union to retain british
sovereignty of britain the
integrity of the pound
some of
you want to make concession
i
hear some of you agree with the
late french proposal
well why do not you get on a boat
to calais
yes why do not you put
on a beret and pay of you
income to the french government

right
what can we realistically
hope to achieve by the end of
session lord president


and why have we not make more
progress to date
what be that
be
that the timetable
i have not see
that
may i see it

here it be prime minister
of
course

the word be sloppy here and
here

if you say so

i do say so

it be merely a first draft

this be ridiculous
there be two
ts in committee

this be shameful
shameful
i
can not even rely on you for a
simple timetable
be you unwell
yes you be unwell
give i the
pencil give it to i

if this be the good you can do i
have well send you to hospital

i letter of resignation

we difference i be afraid
cannot be reconciled

i have do what i believe to be
right for i party and i country
the time have come for other to
consider they own response to the
tragic conflict of loyalty with
which i have myself wrestle for
perhaps too long




Geoffreys speech in the house of
commons be devastate



just could not take any more of
the bully



he be almost invite someone to
challenge she for leadership of
the party



she behave appallingly
i
would not have spoken to i
gamekeeper like that



i do not think she can survive
this

i be here to announce i decision
to put i name forward as leader
of the conservative party
i have
nothing but admiration for we
prime minister margaret thatcher
but i believe we party and we
country need a new leader


it be extraordinary
the rule of
the conservative party make it
possible for conservative mps to
depose a sitting prime minister

i be the prime minister

sweetie



as conservative mps gather in
westminster to discus who they
will back in the leadership
contest the prime minister said
she would not be divert from
critical international affair

tonight in paris mrs thatcher be
among thirty four world leader
who come together to celebrate the
end of the cold war and herald the
start of a peaceful new age of
EastWest cooperation


there be a general feel that mrs
thatcher be going to win on the
first ballot
we be going to put
it to bed tomorrow night be how
one of she campaign staff put it

i really think you should come
home and defend yourself old girl
heseltine be campaigning
ferociously

seeing an end to the cold war
do not you
after all this time
they know what i stand for

will she or will she not be in
the job tomorrow

margaret they can not touch you



mrs thatcher have failed to win
enough vote to secure an outright
win in the leadership contest and
must now decide whether to put she
name forward for the second round

as mrs thatcher leaf paris for
london to make a last ditch
attempt to pull together support
for she leadership the ship may
have sail


treachery

we will never win another election
lead by that woman

we need a leader who listen

this be not about she it be about
the party

one must know when to go

the question be how do anyone
put it to she

if you be to stand i of course
would vote for you prime minister


of course would vote for you
prime minister but i do not think
you can win
the loyalty of i
colleague cannot be count upon

it be the people who put i here

the loyalty of i colleague
cannot be count upon


it be up to they to tell i when
to go

margaret you can not let they do
this to you
please boss

they will destroy you

throw in the towel now love
do not let those bastard see you
humiliated

the right honourable gentleman be
afraid



this be a naked strategy of
closing some coal mine and then
selling off




they believe in striking i
believe in work



this be the woman who be watch
ten man on hunger strike starve
themselves to death and never
flinch



despicable and cowardly



cynical falklands war



more homeowner more
shareholder more saving



i offer i resignation after
eleven and a half extraordinary
year

proud to have left britain in a
