victory fifteen foot underwater on the
trashcovered muddy bottom of marina del
rey

washington redskin running back and land on
he throat elbow first

miami be beating the skin in front of
seventysix thousand crazed washington fan

showing and the skin
down by a touchdown

could be the last play

could be the last play
of the season if the
player go out



take it all in people
this could be it for





once again if you
have not hear it be
announced during
halftime that the



player
association will hold a
press conference
immediately follow
this game that would
make it about five
of the clock eastern time
and it be expected that
the player union will
announce a strike
effective immediately



it be all about money
folk
more money of
course and be not it
always
the shame of
it be the big loser
be you out there the
fan

play ball on the
dolphin thirtythree
yard line

well
martel go
down ten yard short of
a score

on maybe the last play
of the season

i think he might have
slipped

that going around

we be coming to you
house tonight and
we be going to fucking
kill you
and if you
get a dog we be going to
kill you fuck dog

tonal quality of a
loss

nice medicine for a
loss
keep we calm
make we not so sad
keep we on an even
keel

perspective do not

bullshit he slipped
he could have score
anybody could have
score

in the god damn grave
and i could have
score

mister ONeil let we
face fact
the
player be going out
it be going to happen
and
nobody want to get
hurt on the last play
before a strike that
could go on for the
rest of the season

make you feel good
when you fire someone
we know it do do not

tonight


hey man i do what i
union say

but you be already one
of the high paid
player in the game
the fan just do not see
the point of a player
like you strike

let i tell you
something
i be a big
man you see

there be some day
when i be so beat up
that i cannot dress i
own big ass
i ask
management for a valet
or some shit to help i
dress and they said no
way
so fuck they



shut up everybody here
it be



i have just left a
meeting with
representative of the
owner and i be sad to
say that they have
refuse the player
final demand which
center around a rise in
the current salary cap



therefore i be
recommend that all



player walk out
and not play until we
demand be meet
i
want the player to
walk out tall to walk
out righteous to walk
out in the knowledge
that we do this as a
team
we shall
overcome the fat cat
i send peace to i
union brother

big baby for year

no team owner in they
right mind be going to
give back those

revenue

all we promised fox be
twentytwo guy with a
pulse every sunday
but think about it
jimmy
we get a great
opportunity here
we
get a chance to put a
team on the field that
play the game just for
the love of it
like
we used to play it
McGINTY
we also used to play
without face guard

deal


six phone line
with internet access on
two
one for defense
and one for offense

we think we would
skip special team for
the moment

except for a kicker
we definitely need a
kicker
place kicker
over a punter

the think be that
if we lose the toss we
have to be able to at
least kick off

okay
here the list
of every player cut
this past season
what
we would like to do
be
McGINTY
those people

list
most of they be cut

on
they have all play
football somewhere but
only a few in the pro
and they have all get
something
unique to
bring to the game
we be going to take these
people and try to put
together a win
team
and if nothing
else they should be
fun to watch

you will not need a
center

the same thing

i theory be he come
out of retirement to
see if he could win
with loser
oh shit
i be sorry
i do not mean

hey it be okay
i have
be called badly

like after that sugar
bowl game
i guess you
could survive anything
after that

sometimes i feel like
everybody in the world
see that game
like i
could go to india and
some little guy would
run up to i and say
boy do you suck in
the sugar bowl


so how come you be
such a fan

i dad
he be a huge
redskin fan
for
year
he be in his
twentyninth year at
the senate office
build
as a guard
not a senator
the
only thing that keep
he going he say be
i and the redskin
that be where i get it
i fanness
be you scare

scared
well
yes
absolutely

it be okay
anybody
would be
but you be
good
and you will do
good

well thank you
look
i get to study the play
book tonight
so
i will see you

break a leg tomorrow

what

it be from the theater
for open night
you
say the bad thing
that can happen
and
it will not
break a leg

alright this be how we
used to stop a run
back

i can not wait

oooh
get i a judge
man that feel good


do not be asking for no
autograph from the
real player and then
go in and watch the
scab

that be not the message
we want to send we
child


you okay

remember to nod you
head on the snap

nod i head

for when murrays in
the deaf kid
hello
he need to look at you
on the snap

what be you crazy
nobody eat right
before a game

i always eat before a
big match
i need the
bulk

coach mcginty i would like
to lead the team in the
pregame prayer
McGINTY
no
no praying
that be the problem with
professional sport
today
too much god
damn praying
five
hundred dollar fine to
the first man i hear
praying
McGINTY
lot of people be
waiting for you to fall
on you ass today
and guess what
you be
going to
but i do not
give a shit if you look
funny out there
or if
you miss a block or
drop a pass or trip
over you own dick
this be professional
and the difference
between professional
and amateur between
playing for the
washington redskin and
michigan state be
simply
money
you
be be paid to win
not just to play
not
just to learn how to be
good sport
not for
the alumni
you be
be paid to win
i
do not care how the fuck
you do it
but i be
demanding it
because
those guy whose place
you be taking have
forgotten that simple
fact
so go win it


pretty bold move by
new england patriot
owner victor kiam who
go out and buy an
entire semipro team
once the strike
happen

redskin management on
the other hand be
going with a bunch of
unknown
they public
relation people do not
even have bios yet on
most of they player
although we will see one
or two familiar face
out there today

like shane falco the
enormously talented
college quarterback
from ohio state who
never fulfilled his
potential in the proas
wow remember that
sugar bowl falco
quarterbacked when
florida state cream
they

oh yeah they be
absolutely decimate

dust
and if i be not
mistake falco set a
record in that game for
bowl interception
anyway for some of
these player this be
another shot
a last
shoot probably for a
guy like falco

bob i be standing in
front of redskin
owner edward frances
ONeils home and all
we know right now be
that the washington

second week be
expected to go out with
a fizzle
most expert
think that the monday
night DallasWashington
game will be the last
with replacement
player
but even that
game will feature at
least percent of the
regular cowboy
coach
james mcginty will try
to make it a perfect
three and with a team
make up totally of
replacement player
well
and one felon

a chance to win

it can be a game of
luck
and under no
circumstance can we
allow a scab team to go

especially against the
dallas cowboy
it be
just not good for the
game

throwing a football
with bruise rib

will not give i the time
of day

happen
so you get to
stop seeing she
just
on principle

come on

it

i will not go out with she
anymore

good
gentleman
hey have a great game


i think that mister
matheson here and
myself be very close
to an agreement that
will put the pro back
in profootball

mister matheson what
be the stick point
in the negotiation as
far as the owner be
concern

only one
that the
player immediately go
back to work with no
change in the exist
contract


good evening from the
big here in
washington

where
the mighty dallas
cowboy take on the
cinderella washington
Scabskins as they
have come to be known
hi i be al michaels and
we be witness to a
unique matchup tonight
as shane falco and a
contingent of strike
player go up against
the entire regular
squad of the dallas
cowboy
yes you
hear right
every
cowboy have now cross
the picket line some
as late as this
afternoon and they
will all play tonight
can a rag tag group of
hasbeens and castoff
stand up to what be
once called americas
team
and what about
the strike itself
it
have be so ineffective
that many predict it
will be over before
this game end
stay
tune as boomer and dan
join i for strike
ball

style

McGINTY
congratulations
it be
official
you be
staying on after the
strike
McGINTY
it be probably good
that you not say
anything to the rest of
the guy until after
the game
okay

whatever you say
coach
McGINTY
alright listen up
the strike be just
about history
by
tomorrow you will no
longer be redskin
it be important that you
leave here however
with the knowledge that
you have make a
difference in you own
life in the owner
life or what be left
of it and especially
the fan
you have
proven to a skeptical
america that sport be
not about contract or
agent or shoe deal
sport be about rise
to the occasion
we
have one more
opportunity tonight to
do that one more
chance to show what
heart be all about
the dallas cowboy be
waiting out there to
kill you
i expect
nothing less than for
you to win even in you
death throe
we have
a powerful weapon on
we side tonight
there be no tomorrow
for most of you
and
that make you very
dangerous people
use
it


that be one very big
leg on lou pacifico
he be a big reason why
this strike team be two
and

but the fact be a
kicker do not an
offense make
i think
tonight the Scabskins
will have a very rude
awaken

but you have to admit
dan falco be proving
to be the real thing

well boomer no i
do not have to admit

bound
be passblocking but the first guy spin
he around and the second guy run right

a lot of the clock



and it look like falco
cannot answer the bell
he be still on the bench
and it appear that
safety earl wilkinson
will be leading the
redskin offense



they just need to get
the ball in field goal
range



and for pacifico
that be anything up to
