the hello it even know we be still
here

it be be listening to we
it be
get no eye
it sure as hell can not
smell anything underground so i
figure

of course
it can sense the
slight seismic vibration
hear
every move we make
especially on
this rock
it be a perfect
conductor

i always wanted to be stick on a
desert island
but somehow i
always imagined you know water




you know i hate to be crude but
i be going to have to take care of some
business here

i too

same here



darn it



you okay



yeah
but i will tell you if you
ever wanted proof god be a man
this be it




thanks

no problem
anytime

well folk what be the plan

first let we see if Stumpys still
out there

do not he have a home to go to

well that be why edgar never get
down off that tower

i might have an idea

we be going to have to come up with
some kind of plan or it be just
going to wait we to death

well i be wonder if we
could

well let we just run for it
we
outran that one yesterday at least
on a sprint

run for it
running not a plan
running be what you do when the
plan fail
you be not even trying
to come up with a plan

well it be not like we have get a
hell of a lot of option

you guy know how to pole vault
impress

we just stay where it can not get
we
on these residual boulder
i truck park right next to
one

stay on those residual boulder

tammy lynn baxter she do a lot of
polevaulting





think it be still following we

let we assume that it be

and once we hit that truck we get to
go fast
i say we all jump together

ready

yeah
one two three

come on girl it be not going to give
we much time







we well get everybody together

you go north i will go south

right

i will bet you be sorry the college
ever send you up here

well i be scare but i be not
sorry

you know val go to that college
too
for a whole year
could not
quite sit still for it though
have too much vinegar in he system
but once he settle down forget
this cowboy stuff he will be one in
a million

all right i be about as subtle as
a donkey ass
pardon i french
i be just saying the boyo get
potential that be all



you serious val
you think we be
not even safe here in town

ask i that after you meet one
i
think we should all get the hell
out while the get good

why not just take a number ten pick
axe and give it one good whack

nestor damn it these thing be
big than an airstream trailer

god i have get to find mindy

hey pham where be burt and heather

can not raise they
i guess they be
still out there somewhere

if you have get a radio why be not
you calling somebody in bixby
the
police or

can not reach outside the valley
you know because of the mountain

hey rhonda what be the name you
call those thing huh

where do they come from

huh
i do not know

you be a scientist right

you should have a theory at least

look these thing be absolutely
unprecedented

yeah but where do they come from

where do they come from
okay
worm probably in the jurassic
period
cosmic radiation be much
high then
so they mutate
and
they get so big they just sink
right into the ground and fell
asleep
but now continental drift
have bring they to the surface
ready to be harvest by the
ancient alien meat grower who
planted they here

you be right do not matter where
they come from

right
we need to be talking about
what we be going to do

i goodness valentine once they
see the road be out and the phone
line be down someone will be
along to look in on we
do not you
think





no no no they
listen
they can
sense the slight vibration
through the ground
that be how
they see
that be how they
hunt

so like we do not vibrate right
maybe they will not even come to here
huh
maybe they leave we alone

they caught up with edgar here
they grab old fred here
they
nail the asshole dog here
and the
doctor place be here

this valley just one long
smorgasbord and if we do not haul
ass outta here we be the next
course

you little ass wipe
you knock
that off or you be going to be
shit that basketball
pardon
i french

now val let we assume they be as
dangerous as you say
where be we
going to go that be safe than right
here

Rhondas get an idea about that

yes see they move very easily
through the pleistocene Alluvials
the dirt
the loose soil that
make up the valley floor
but
they can not move through solid rock
i think we should travel west to
the mountain

you know up the jeep trail

the mountain be solid granite
we would be safe there and we could
hike along they
all the way to
bixby if we have to
