word music by peggy lee
when i be a wee lad
and dark be the night
afraid i would be
til the bright morning light
and sometimes
for comfort
away i would steal away
i would go to the land of the leal
and soon i would be there
it take i no time
i heart would be soar
as i make the climb
and there be the green grass
so cool and so sweet
so good to be run through
with happy bare foot
and who be i teacher
and how do i know
just when to be going
and which way to go
but always when wish
away i would steal
away i would go to the land of the leal
and now that i be old
i try to be wise
but when i be trouble
i still close i eye
and just like the wee lad
away i will steal
away i will go to the land of the leal
for there be no question
and there be no lie
and never a storm there
to darken the sky
the bird who be flying
no free they feel
than i
when i live in the land of the leal


be an impose
businessman wearing full sideburn
he stare stonily at the last empty
chair then at Filby with annoyance
a man of the world
impeccably attire in the late fashion
welcome Filby the only way he know by
lifting he glass of whiskey
a middle aged man with keen
black pierce eye angrily chew on
he havana
Filby fidget uncomfortably in he chair
as
hillyer glance impatiently at his
watch compare time with a
behind he then snap
it shut and glare at


i say this be outright rude of the man

he be undoubtedly be detain
that be
all
unscrew the cigar from
he tight lip
this be such a confounded waste of
time
if he be not coming i have any
number of more important thing to do


speak up what be it woman

well
be we or be we not invited
to dinner

apparently we be
to mrs
Watchett
how long have he be go


i can not rightly say sir
several
day
i hardly catch a glimpse of
he lately
he never leaf the
laboratory and come out only to
nibble at he meal
but he do tell
i day ago about dinner tonight and
left these instruction

thank you mrs
Watchett

indicate the
note
what do it say Filby
what be
wrong

nothing really
george merely say
that if he be not here by eight we be
to begin without he


dinner be serve gentleman
put he glass
down
first sensible thing i have hear all
evening

this be peculiar
he be usually very
prompt precise and punctual


he be making fool of we by invite
we here and then not showing up
it be not the behavior of a gentleman

to say nothing of the waste of
time


to say nothing of the waste of
time
arise lifting
he glass
one thing i will say for george he
keep the good cellar in the south of
england
and mrs
Watchett be the
fine cook in the world
i think
i will drink to that


there
there

good lord
what be happen

i be all right
just some food
a
drink

be you all right
a delay
answer
of course
i be
all right

half
apology half concern
i do not recognize you
it be
so dark

meat
i be hungry for meat


well can not you speak man
what
happen to you
be not you going
to tell we

leave he alone can not you

it be all right
i want to tell

it will keep george
eat rest a
little

no
i must tell it now
while i
still remember

relax try to relax a bit
you have
all the time in the world

you be right david
that be exactly what i have

all the time in the world
ever since we be all together
five day ago the last day of
eighteen hundred ninety nine

should give the effect of the ebony box
emerging from the time traveller brain


there in that box rest the result
of two year labor

i wanted to finish the job before
the new century begin
i barely
make it

marvelous


what be it

well it have to do with time


i have always maintained what this
nation need be a reliable timepiece
the navy need one
the army need
one
for the artillery you know

could not do well george
so
that be why you have be in hide

clever of you indeed
study the time
traveller reaction
i do not believe george be refer
to a new kind of timepiece

when i speak of time i be refer
to the fourth dimension

go on george

now as you know the difficulty
in explaining the fourth dimension
be that it cannot be see or feel
it must be think of

if you do not mind george would
you refresh i on the first three
dimension


really Filby they must have
taught you something at school
baiting
dr
hillyer
suppose you explain it doctor


certainly
he demonstrate
pompously
when i move in a straight line
forward or backward that be one
dimension
when i move to the
leave or right two dimension

when i move up and down three
dimension
a bright idea light up
he face
at last he can
get ahold of the box but
Filby interfere before
dr
hillyer can get his
finger on it and he have
to be satisfied with merely
pointing
for instance this box have three
dimension
length breadth and
height

well then what be the fourth
dimension


well that be
that be mere theory
no one can really say what the
fourth dimension be or even that
it exist

on the contrary doctor
the
fourth dimension be as true and as
real a dimension as any of the
other three
in fact they could not
exist without it


how do you mean

well take that box
it have the
first three dimension as you said
but what if it do not exist in time
it would not exist at all would it


no

so for an object to exist at all
it must exist in the fourth dimen
sion
and that fourth dimension
be duration
time


all right
but what be in that box

i be coming to that
but first
consider
why be it that we usually
ignore the fourth dimension
because
we have no freedom to move in it
we
can move in the other three up
down forward backward sideways
but when it come to time we be
prisoner
do you follow i anthony

george
you have given a most lucid
explanation and all that
but i
do not think i entirely understand

look
there be a lot of thing in
the world you do not understand
be not there

of course
quite a number

but you do not refuse to believe
in they because of that

not if i can see the proof with
i own eye

good
all i be asking you to do
now be to witness a demonstration
of the possibility of movement in
the fourth dimension
to dr
hillyer
philip will you please hand i
that box

i have tell you
the large model
can carry a passenger on a journey
through time
not through space
mind you but through time

oh i say george
if you start
floating around in the future be not
you likely to mess thing up for the
rest of we


the future be already there
it be
irrevocable and cannot be changed

that be the most important question
to which i hope to find an answer
can man control he destiny
can he
change the shape of thing to come

imagine that this cigar be the time
traveller
now this lever in front
of he control movement
forward
pressure send the machine into the
future backward pressure into the
past
and the hard the pressure
the fast the machine travel

this experiment can be perform
only once
if it succeed i lose
i model forever
that be why i
need witness

go ahead

you be ready then

doctor hillyer would you care
to lend i you hand
the glass on the silver tray rattle
and clink against each other
the gas light of the chandelier
flicker rapidly
vase shudder and move slightly on
the mantelpiece

touch his
cigar pocket
i will be damn
almost
to himself
it worked



where do it go

go
nowhere in the usual sense
it be still here
indicate space where the
machine stand
but it be no longer in the present
it be travel through time to
the future to be precise


do you seriously expect we to
believe that

certainly


but you just said it have not
really moved

that be correct


then why can not we see it

because we be in this room on
december st while the
model you see be perhaps a hundred
year away
this room or even
this house may no longer exist a
hundred year from now
but the
time machine be occupying the same
space it do a moment before it go
off on it journey


if it occupy the same space i
should be able to feel it

you must remember that the space
you have just put you hand through
be today space
you can not put
you hand into the space of
tomorrow


space be space
it do not change
the same space that be here now should
be here a hundred or even a thousand
year from now

no
time change space
this flat
ground we be standing on now could
have be at the bottom of the sea
a million year ago
and a million
year from now it could be the
interior of a huge mountain

suppose what you say be true
exactly what do you suggest we do
with such a contraption

for i part i intend to take a
journey into the future
unless
someone else prefer to volunteer

i say george
suppose you go off
and get lost in the fiftieth century
how will you find you way back
quite
serious
that be a calculate risk i be prepare
to take


now listen george
i do not
know what you take we for but
we be not fool
there be a
number of way of do a
disappearing trick
but a man of
you ability should not bother
with such nonsense

unable to
resist the temptation for
sarcasm
there be a war on you know
the
boer be putting up a pretty stiff
fight in south africa and we
country need inventor like you
i can put you in touch with the
war office if you wish
look
up at Filby
what do you think
hesitating
slightly and then
i think dr
hillyer have a point
george


now you be be sensible
i will
take care of it first thing in
the new year


well time to go

yes we all have we plan for
tonight

be you all right george

of course i be


coming bridewell

thanks for coming

happy new year
goodbye george
happy twentieth century
etc


come on bridewell

i think i would well stay

you need not have troubled yourself
i be all right

no you be not
you have be
behave oddly for over a month
now
i be not leaving until you tell i
what be on you mind

i appreciate you gesture david
but if you do not mind i would rather
you left i alone

you have changed george
enormously

i be sorry
look up to he
directly
will you answer i one question
honestly

i will try

why this preoccupation with time

why not

do not go simple on i george
a beat
then calmly
if you want to know the truth i
do not much care for the time i be
born into
it seem people be not
dying fast enough these day
they
call upon science to invent new
more efficient weapon to depopulate
the earth

i quite agree with you
but here
we be and we have to make the good
of it

you may have to
i do not
making a half
hearted attempt at levity
all right
take a journey on you
contraption
what would you become
greek
roman
one of the
pharaoh

i prefer the future

you be not seriously saying you can
do it

you see the experiment this afternoon
do not you

i see a toy machine vanish
but
i be certain there be a number of
way of do that trick
any
magician at the hippodrome could
probably do it

it be no trick
would you care
to see the fullscale model

no i would not
i have no desire
to tempt the law of providence and
i do not think you should
it be not
for man to trifle with

now you sound like hillyer and kemp

there be something in they common
sense attitude to life
george i speak to you as a friend
more as a brother
if that machine
can do what you say it can
destroy
it
destroy it george before it
destroy you

you must have plan for new year
eve
do not let i keep you

mary be not well
we decided to
stay home with the baby
but why
do not you come home with i
you
have not see little jaime for a
long time

i can not

what be stopping you

i just want to see the old century
out by myself

have it you own way

will you promise i that you will not
leave the house tonight

i promise you i will not walk out of
the door

david
please do not think i un
friendly
come over to dinner
next friday
will not you

very well

fine
and will you bring the other
with you

whatever you say george
happy
new year

and a very happy new year to you david


will you be have supper in this
evening sir
while ex
changing jacket with mrs
Watchetts help
i do not think so mrs
Watchett
why
do not you take the evening off and
celebrate


thank you sir but if you will not be
need i i think i will turn in early
and get some sleep
it i can
goodnight sir

goodnight

oh mrs
Watchett
i have invited mr
Filby and the other
to dinner next friday
happy new year mrs
Watchett


happy new year sir

i start
and the laboratory grow
faint around i

i stopped

no change
everything exactly as it
bad be before
but no

the clock said
when i start and
now it be

and the candle
short by inch

and yet by i watch which be in the
machine with i only a few second
have passed

it be disconcert to see the sun

arc in less than a minute

to see flower closing they eye
for the night change that normally
take hour occure in second be
beautiful

and as yet i be travelling very slowly
what if i go fast
the sun hop swiftly across the sky

the night fall and the star circle
the north star
the sun appear and disappear be
hind the whirl cloud
at night the moon race through
tumultuous cloud
on the follow day the sky darken
with thunderhead
there be a
cataract of lightning and

it become intoxicate
to see an
entire storm in a few second

so i push the lever on toward
even great speed

thirteen year have passed
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
and then

in the year nineteen hundred seventeen
i stopped
distinctive landmark that will stay
recognizable during he journey into
the future thereby giving a clear
conception that timetravelling do
not involve geographical movement
for instance the sharp curve of the
river thames in the distance will
remain even after the house itself
have disappeared


go to a masquerade david
you
look rather silly without you
moustache old man

be you address i sir

Filby
i expect more of an
enthusiastic greet from
smile as he
interrupt
i be afraid you have i confused
with i father sir
there be a
remarkable resemblance
i be
james Filby

be

be you a friend of father

yes
yes
i have be away

he be killed in the war
a year
ago

no
it can not be
then as he realize it
truth
i be sorry to hear that
pause then hesitantly
point
and the gentleman who used to live
across the street

oh he
some inventor who
disappeared around the turn of the
century
if you be interest in
that house forget it
you can not
buy it or even go inside

why be that

i father be executor of the
inventor estate and he refused to
liquidate it
i often chide he on that account
but he feel positive that the owner
would return some day
some people
hereabouts think it be haunted
stare at time traveller
curiously study the
strange cut of he clothes
who be you sir

just a stranger who once know you
father

i see
still curious at the time
traveller abstract attitude
have you be at the front sir

front
what front

why the war of course

what war

great heaven man do not you know
we have be at war with germany
since nineteen fourteen
i think
perhaps you have see action in
france
or maybe
notice confusion add
with a note of compassion
perhaps a cup of tea would make
you feel good
will not you come in

no
no thank you

you be sure you be alright sir

yes i be quite alright

then
goodbye sir

goodbye jaime


as i go along i gain experience
in handling the machine
i find
that i could stop for a day an hour
or even for a second to observe then
go ahead for a year or two
thus i
be able to see the changing world
in a series of glimpse

good heaven that be a dress

this be intriguing
i wonder
just how far woman would permit
this to go


i begin to grow fond of that
mannequin
maybe because like i
she do not age

suddenly in nineteen forty i begin
to be buffete from side to side
i first thought be that the machine
have a mechanical defect or a part
have worn out

the last time i have stopped be in
nineteen seventeen twenty three year
ago
and the war with germany be
still wage now in the air with
fly machine
it do not seem
possible they could go on fight
all these year and still have the
means of fight
then i realized
the truth of the matter
this be a
new war
there must have be an
interval of peace in between these
war
yet they have learned nothing
but to prepare even more effective
means of destroy one another
i
decided to push on into time and see
the outcome

the fight in the sky last only
a few moment
by nineteen forty five
it be over but i continued on a
few more year before pause for
another glimpse of i silent never
age friend

it va reassure to find that she
have not changed
only she costume
provocative to say the least
i
wonder what she would look like
ten year hence

at first i wonder if i machine and
i be the because of the panic
i be
to soon find out we be not

i can not understand you

confounded radio in this thing
make more noise than it do sense

Filby

i name be mister Filby
do not
you hear the air raid siren

you mean that horrible screech

it be not constructed for it
aesthetic value you know but to
warn silly young fool like yourself
to get down into the shelter
now
go on

but i be perfectly comfortable and
i find you store magnificent
what
splendid achievement what gigantic
stride mankind have taken what

come on young man
we would well be
going before the mushroom start
sprout
look at time traveller
with renew interest
you do look familiar
have not
we meet somewhere before

indeed we have
right here
many
year ago

i be sure of that but the exact
time escape i

it be two war ago i believe
nineteen seventeen

why now i recall
the chap who
inquire about i father and
the house that used to be across
the way
stop and stare at
the time traveller
but no
that be impossible
you
have not changed
you be not a day
old
and you clothes

i be afraid it be going to take i
a little time to explain
you see

the last alert
hurry

listen to i
it be important

look
an atomic satellite zeroing
in
that be important

hurry
hide til the all clear

all clear
i have get to talk to you

the labor of century go in an
instant

but then mother earth aroused by mane
violence respond with volcanic
violence or she own

then i see i own danger
i too be
to be engulf

but to go back be unthinkable

only i speed through time saved i
from be roast alive and encase
in stone forever

the molten rock cool
he close he burn
eye as the last of the
light vanish
i pray
wonder how many century
how many eon must pass before the wind
and rain could wear away the mountain
that enclose i

darkness
darkness for century

i wonder if there be still war
be wage on the ground above i
if man would still exist on earth
when i see the sun again

the century rolled by
i put
i trust in time and wait for
the rock to wear down around i

i be free again

thousands of century passed but
the earth stay green
there be
no winter
no war
have man finally
learned to control both the element
and themselves
i have to stop and
find out


at last i have find a paradise

nature tamed completely and more
bountiful than ever before

flower everywhere
the whole landscape
one vast garden with no sign of weed or
briar

unrepaired for century
maybe
unlived in for as long
it would be no paradise if it
belong to i alone

anyone here
musingly
to himself
so this be mane future
o
s

to bask in the sunlight bathe in
the clear stream and eat the fruit
of earth with all knowledge of work
and hardship forgotten

well and why not

help she

be you all right


why do you

why do i what

come after i

i do it to save you life young
lady which i be afraid do not hold
much meaning for you or anyone else

it do not

must have be fifty of you friend
watch you drown
not one of
they so much as lift a finger

curious attitude in a curious
world
a pause then a
smile
be not you the least bit interest
in what i be
where i come from

should i be

perhaps you would well take i to
someone a bit old i can talk to

there be no one old

do not anyone age in this land
of yours

what be you name

Weena

how do you spell that

spell

write
can not you write
look

and what be you people called

eloi

come
we must go in

why
what be wrong

it be get dark
directed to
young man but mean for the
entire group
i do not mind telling you i be quite
hungry
i have come a long long way

in i time a berry this size would
have make news in every civilized
country

sir perhaps curiosity have die
perhaps even courtesy have die but
i have come a long way and there be
thing i would like to know
consider a
moment then
why

because i shall return to i time
and they will ask question such as
what kind of government rule you
world

we have no government
speaking
as though to a child
you must have a body of man who pass
and enforce law

there be no law
taken aback
then
how do you get you food and clthe

do not anyone work

no
pick up
fruit
then where do this come from

it grow
it always grow

but it must be planted cultivate
nurture
unless
with mistake insight as he
observe no reaction to this
last query
unless you have an economy so well
organized that you can devote all you
time to study and experimentation
be i right

you ask many question

yes
and i be not ashamed of it

million yesterday of sensitive
man dying for they dream
for
what

and play

i be returning to i time
not to
tell of the uselessness of the
struggle not to tell of the
hopeless future but only so that
i can die among man

where the time traveller house once stand


i hear you pounding
i come to
tell you

how do you open that panel

no one open it
only the Morlocks

Morlocks
who be the Morlocks

why be you afraid of the Morlocks

tell i

when they call we must go below

do the Morlocks live beneath the
earth
why must you obey they command

they give we the food we eat the
clothes we wear
we must do as
they command

what happen to you people when
they go below
repress an in
voluntary shudder
no one know
no one have ever
return
smile
at she warmly reassuringly
it will not happen to you

it be night

only child be frighten by
the dark
but then you be a
child be not you
Weena glance around
warily into the shadow
she anxiety mounting
i will build a fire
taking he
hand rise
let we go from here
get
up
i can not child
i machine be inside there i
intend to wait here til morning
then find some way of get
inside

no you must not
stop
then
help i gather some wood

where be you from
pick
up dry branch
as a matter of fact i be from
right here
there be where i house stand many
thousands of year ago
here to
that monument be i laboratory
about there be i library where i
once sit talking with friend about
i time machine

i hope to learn a great deal
i
hope to take back the knowledge
the advancement mankind make
instead what do i find
vegetable

the human race reduced to live
vegetable

get i a few more twig

what be it

Morlocks
strike
match and hold it to twig
this seem to keep they away
while
examining she hand
what ever make you put you hand in
the fire

i never see it before

do you know that the first thing
which separated man from the rest
of the mammal be he knowledge of
fire
no i suppose you do not
the next great stride come with
the discovery of the wheel
do you know what that be
i be sorry i be angry with you
people
i have no right to be
no more than if i have visit the
island of bali in i own time
you be safe inside you great
house yet you come out into the
night to warn i
the one
characteristic which distinguished
man from the animal kingdom be the
spirit of self sacrifice
you have
that quality girl
i be sure all
of you people have it
all it
require be someone to reawaken it
i shall try if you will let i
will
you

i do not understand you but i
believe you

that be a good start
now try to
tell i
who or what be the Morlocks
be they people or animal
what do you know about yourself
the
past
do not you people ever speak
of the past

there be no past

do not you ever wonder about the future

there be no future

mans past be mainly a grim struggle
for survival but there have be
moment when a few voice have spoken
up
these rare moment have make the
history of man a glorious thing
i
refuse to believe it be dead and go
we have have we dark age before and
this be only another of they
all
you need be for someone to show you
the way out
i be only a tinkering
mechanic but there must be this
hide spark in one of you people
if i can only kindle that spark i
coming here will have some meaning


i effort next morning to open the
panel be fruitless
i have to find
another way to retrieve i machine

listen
do you hear

yes

machine

no
Morlocks

you mean those animal run machine

they be Morlocks

i know but have you see the
machine

no only hear of they

who told you

the talk ring

what sort of ring

ring that talk

can you show i these ring


be these the talk ring

yes

they speak

yes

of what

thing no one here understand

how do you get it to talk

whosoever chance upon these ring
will probably hear the last recorded
voice of civilized man
this be the
year four thousand eight hundred and
twentynine

the war between the east and west
which be now in it three hundredth
and twentysixth year have at last
come to an end
there be nothing
left to fight with and few of we
left to fight
the atmosphere have
become so pollute with deadly
germ that it can no longer be
breathe
there be no place on
this planet that be immune
the
last surviving factory for the
manufacture of oxygen have be
destroyed
stockpile be rapidly
diminishing and when they be go
we must die

this be the last day
we the last
to survive have have we final meet
we have decided to split into two
group
each man and woman have make
he own decision
some have chosen
to take refuge in the great cavern
and find a new way of life far down
below the earth surface
the rest
of we have decided to take we chance
in the sunlight small as those chance
may be

from the talk ring i learned how
the human race divided itself and
how the world of the eloi and Morlocks
begin

by some quirk of fate the Morlocks
have become the master and the eloi
they servant
the Morlocks main
tained they and breed they like cattle
only to take they below when they
reach maturity which explain why
there be no old people along they

now i know i must go below
it be
the only means of finding a way up
into the sphinx to reach i machine
and to find out what happen to the
little people when they go below

no
do not go
please

you will not come back

i will be back
ing sequence the dirgelike
mournfully


Weena
where be you girl

what be happening
tell i
o
s

Weena
shout in
despair
Weena

stop
o
s

what be you running from
sharply
gesture back toward the panel
where have they go
what happen to they
do not stand there like a fatted
cattle grazing contentedly in lush
pasture
answer i
what be
wrong

there be nothing wrong
it be all
clear

what do you mean all clear

all clear
think
rapidly talking to himself
once
in the middle nineteen
hundreds i hear a man
the falling bomb
to the man in white
and the crowd
that be over
go
dead for
hundreds of thousand of year
there be no more fly machine
no bomb
no war

yes the ring have tell we that
story

but you do not listen
you do not
learn anything
all that be left
be fear
a blind animal fear
age ago man be taught to hide in
the ground when the siren blow
taught to run from a raining death
but those man be dead
and so be
the man who slaughter they
do not
you understand
you be slave of a dead past
you
do not even own you soul
you be
lead to slaughter like sheep
o
s

but there be nothing to fear now
it be all clear

what about those who go below
how be they to come back

they never come back
nobody can
bring they back

you can try
will not any of you
even try
almost
to himself
well someone have to try
punctuate the desolation of this
scene as well as the follow sequence




so this be the destiny of the
eloi



they be be breed like cattle
by the Morlocks who have degenerate
into the low form of human
life
cannibalism


Weena


girl
he turn and grasp the
passing young man
come to you sense
all of you

burn will you

quick something to burn
it be
i last match

Weena
Weena get the torch

Weena
go on
go on the
step

the underworld of the Morlocks be
go
and so be the life of leisure
for the eloi

from now on they would have to work
to survive
and looking at they
face i somehow know that they could
start over again

another night be coming but this
night no eloi needed to fear

but what of i
i be imprisoned
in a world in which i do not belong


be you sorry

sorry
sorry for what

that you have to stay

yes
i be sorry because i could
tell so much to the people of i
own time
i could tell they about
the happiness and sorrow the future
have in store for they
they could
learn from it
or would they

you do not want to stay do you

it be not that but i do not fit here
anymore than you would in i time

i would like to see you time

no girl you would not be very
happy there

do you have someone like i
there

no
no one like you
but there
be friend who will miss i
as
a matter of fact i be probably late
already

stealing a glance
then quietly
woman

no man
there be a woman too of course
notice she disappointment
he relent
she look after i house for i
she be sixtytwo year old
much
old than you be

how do they wear they hair

who

the woman in you time

up

up
how

like this

show i

would i be pretty

yes
you would be
more than
pretty
i wish we could go back together
Weena back to i own time
or to
time before that when the world
be young
we could
without
looking at she
come girl
backward

the red hot lava withdraw through the
street ruin and the great rent in the
ground gulp it up quickly
out of the
ruin building be mold and then
atomic explosion in reverse flash
across the screen
the


join the of the
time machine

the sun and the moon chase each other
alternately across the sky gradually
slow



it be ridiculous
simply preposterous

well there be one thing i will say
for you george
you always could
tell a good story
good adventure
yarn i have hear for year
you be a truly fine inventor
george


i will turn down you bed for you

truthfully where have you be
for the past week

now we should not ask such question
walter
it be not hard for a man to
lose a week now and then

i understand you doubt
take it
as a lie if you wish
now that
i be back i scarcely believe it
myself
except that
here be the flower Weena give
i
o
s

present for you david

you be always interest in
botany
try to match they with
any species known today

i do not think i can


be you coming kemp

it be get late and you look
exhaust
you have well get
some rest

goodnight george

thank you david for be such
a good friend always

what do you think Filby

one thing be certain
those
flower could not have possibly
bloom in the wintertime
in the b
g

you do not really think that story
be true

look you chap go on
it be
just a short walk home for i
o
s

go on driver

george

nervous
breathless
oh mr
Filby
what

he be go

to
Filby
there be something funny here sir

i think i understand
look

see the imprint
this be where
the time machine originally
stand
he pace across to the
end of the groove
but the Morlocks moved it
they drag it across the lawn
right into the sphinx
right
here
and Weena be standing there when
he last see she
the same space
in a different time
so he moved
back he heavy machine from here
across the room scratching this
floor
indicate the groove
that lead to the imprint
so that he can appear outside the
sphinx again and help the eloi
build a new world
and build a
new world of he own

faintly
sentimentally
where he left she

but it be not like george
to
return empty hand
to try to
rebuild a civilization without
a plan
to mrs
Watchett
he must have taken something
with he


nothing


nothing except three book

which three book


i do not know
be it important

no i suppose not
only
what
three book would you have taken


mr
Filby do you think he will
ever return

one cannot choose but wonder

you see
he have all the time in
the world
