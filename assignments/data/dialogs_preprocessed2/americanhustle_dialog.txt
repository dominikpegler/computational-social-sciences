do not let he get in you head
listen to i we be dealing with a
very clever individual

richard think about it
you get
some big arrest

going to be all over the news
you

yet

i be sorry do i have the wrong
office
be this
alfonse simone




this be

i name be roger Thigpen
i have have
this office for year
i be a
divorce attorney

you lost two million dollar of
taxpayer money because you be
confused about the location and the
identity of victor Tellegios
attorney




the role of Tellegios attorney
alfonse simone be play by we
friend ed malone



the cold cut king of long island



whose party we be at when sydney
and i first meet



alfonse simone


people believe what they want to
believe richie

that be because you con i
you
both fucking con i
you both
get under i
you do

well that do not sound so good
either
i mean and i do not know
what you be talking about but
let we just assume you want to go
with that story
really
that be the
story you want to go with
that be
what you want the new york time to
hear
that you get con by the
very con man who you forced to
entrap the member of congress in
the first place
that be what you
want to go with
that do not sound
so good for you whole thing

and how ironic that the most
creative mind the one who be
working hardest to get the economy
of new jersey going those be the
one that you round up
and why
because what they be the easy
to go after
and what about the
real bullshit artist

even come close to the big league
those big guy
the money man

we take down some very big guy



some of whom be just do
business as usual helping they
community or they state

larceny in they blood






and they even admit it

any wrongdoing and be photograph and humiliated as he then
sit with she in a federal car



but in all it be six congressman
one united states senator and i
friend carmine Polito








we give the two million back so
carmine get the reduce sentence
month
the loss of he
friendship would haunt i for the
rest of i life





and when the story be written
