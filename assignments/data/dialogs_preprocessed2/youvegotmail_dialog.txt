bookstore

all you really do be this incredibly
noble thing

but i do not know if i

kathleen

but i just

you be a lone reed

you be a lone reed waving in the
breeze standing strong and tall in
the corrupt sand of commerce

i be a lone reed
i be a lone reed



sometimes i wonder about i life
i lead
a small life
well not small but
circumscribed
and sometimes i wonder
do i do it because i like it or because
i have not be brave
so much of what i
see remind i of something i read in a
book when should not it be the other way
around


cont
i do not really want an answer
i just
want to send this cosmic question out
into the void
so goodnight dear void

i go to the Foxbooks Website and you
can buy anything
they ship it to you
in a day
maybe we should get a website

i mother would never have wanted we to
have a website
every book you sell be
a gift from you heart
she always said
that

what if they put we out of business

it be out of the question
we be a
fixture in the neighborhood
we be
practically a landmark
man for woman woman for man woman for
woman what be this

you fill out one of these form and they
file it in the book and if someone want
to meet you they arrange it

what a stupid way to meet someone

compare to the internet

i little thing on the internet be just
a lark

so it be still going on

and i do not plan to meet he
why do i get the feel that you be in
here somewhere

i come in here one night and drink too
much coffee and filled one out
well how be i suppose to meet someone

you be a runner
some day you will make
eye contact with another runner and

no one ever even look at i
they
do not
on top of which who be they
they could like the symphony
i could
never fall in love with someone who
like to go to the symphony

i know
what be you suppose to do
there

i do not know

sit
you be suppose to sit

i could never fall in love with anyone
who smoke cigar either

i will tell you what i hate
big fat leg
like stump

yeah
i hate that too

the bad the bad i could never
under any circumstance love anybody
who have a sailboat

neither could i

if i have to get up on saturday morning
knowing that i be about to go down to
the pier and unravel all those rope and
put on all that sunblock

all that talk about the wind

and then you have to go out on the boat
and you sail and sail and sail until you
be bore witless and then only then
do they say let we turn around and you
realize the trip be only half over only
it be not because the wind have changed

it have not changed
it be die

so then there be more talk about the wind
while you just float up and down trying
not to get nauseous
and when you
finally get back you have to clean up
the boat

why do not people have boat maid

i know
Therere all these people who
would not be catch dead polishing a
doorknob in they house but put they on
a boat and they want to rub down
everything in sight

splendid mixture of poetry and meanness

meanness
let i tell you

do not misunderstand i i be just paying
you a compliment

why be you do this

what have we have
red no crimson

live expert on julius and ethel
rosenberg but someone else entirely
will you be you be mean to he too
will
you start out sweet as sugar candy and
then suddenly miraculously like a bolt
from the blue find that sharp little
tongue of yours

no i will not
because the man who be
coming here tonight be completely unlike
you
the man who be coming here be kind
and funny he have the most wonderful
sense of humor

but he be not here

if he be not here he have a reason
because there be not a cruel or careless
bone in he body
i can not expect you to
know anything about a person like that
you have nothing but a suit

that be i cue
good night



so i said to she if you think i will
even talk to you about paying that kind
of advance for an author whose last book
be be used as trivet all over the
world you be completely crazy


but underneath that disagreeable exterior
she could turn out to be

real bitch
let we not talk about it

have work to do

not really
this place be humming like a
top

what could have happen

why do not he come
maybe he show up
take one look at i and left

not possible

maybe there be a subway accident

absolutely

train be trapped underground with he
inside

and no phone

or an automobile accident
those cab
driver be maniac

they hit something and you slam right
into that plastic partition

he elbow could be in splint so he
can not really dial

or he could be in the hospital in one of
those semiprivate room with like

no phone

what

what be you saying

it could be

he be arrested two block from the
cheesecake place

so that explain it

he be in jail

and there
be

but he get only one call and he have to
use it to call he lawyer
