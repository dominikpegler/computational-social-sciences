and what if i do not want to give up on
she

you do not call

but you said i should not call if i
wanted
to give up on she

right

so i do not call either way

right

so what be the difference

the only difference between giving up and
not giving up be if you take she back
when she want to come back
see you
can not do anything to make she want to
come back
you can only do thing to
make she not want to come back

so the only difference be if i forget
about she or pretend to forget about she

right

well that suck

it suck

so it be almost a retroactive decision
so i could like let we say forget about
she and when she come back make like i
just pretended to forget about she

right
or more likely the opposite

right
wait what do you mean

i mean first you will pretend not to care
not call whatever and then
eventually you really will not care

unless she come back first

ah see that be the thing
somehow they
do not come back until you really do not
care anymore

there be the rub

there be the rub

thanks man
sorry we always talk about
the same thing all the time

hey man do not sweat it

drink and smoke and look cool with his
buddy who do not dance either

maybe it do not matter if he be a good
dancer because it be a slow song if that be
what he be afraid of
