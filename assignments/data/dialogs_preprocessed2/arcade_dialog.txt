hi kid
mr
Finster

we be glad you people could make it and
we be anxious to have you try out we new
product
we think it be going to be a big
seller
but you be the people that make it
happen
you be the market share everyone
tearing each other apart to get at
it be
you opinion that be going to make or break
we

so what be so different about arcade
you
guy be talking about it for month

man after i own heart
straight to the
point
what be different about be the way it
react
it respond like a human do
it
learn
it adapt
each time you play it
change it strategy

that be impossible

be it
why do not you see for you self

go for it nick

the CyberGloves be key into the game
response mechanism
you will be able to pick
thing up inside the world
tool weapon
it will feel like they be really in you
hand

the goggle heighten the experience
when
we said reality will never be the same
we be not kidding

escape

in case thing get too intense
it
automatically freeze the game give you a
breather
thing can get pretty wild

nick will not need it

you be good eh

the good

so what be the scenario
be i saving a
princess
fight zomby

it change
there be eleven level
each
one be a different layer of the
universe
the concept be you be enter
the video game itself making you way
across the circuit board to the logic core
arcade brain

so how do i start

the game will guide you

i




what be

nick




what be it do

memorize nicks feature
watch



i

do not



check it out

come on nick

nick
you okay

you get to try this thing

go for it

hold i key then

so how do i get back in

just hit again


here what we be going to do
what i be
hold be the home version of
the prototype

in a month or so we be planning on release
in both version but we be still
fine tuning and that be where you guy luck
out
so what we will do be have you register
with we and then we be going to loan these
out to you for a week or so
the only thing
you have to do in return be answer some
markete question

meet you by the car


we need to find a payphone


that be what i think

what

it be not just the cable system
it be in
the phone system as well the electronic
net
it be everywhere

nick what be it

maybe it be alive in a way
some sort of
electronic intelligence
it be like a
computer virus that developed a personality
or something
it be selfreplicating
it
mimic life

like the fractal

it be grow
get strong
maybe it be
only localize now

but then it hit the relay station

right
and then communication satellite
and then anywhere

anywhere
we have to stop it from get out

it be already out

the police then

give i a break alex
what be we going
to tell they
excuse i officer but
there be some sort of electronic monster
loose in the phone line
i would think twice
about calling any of those number

then where do we go

i do not know



what

they make
it be still a game
right
it think like a game
maybe it
still have to play by the rule
someone have
to program it in the first place do not
they

you mean we learn the rule

and beat it at it be own game

you realize that in order to do that we would
actually have to play the game

i be afraid you would say that


may i help you

we need to see mr
Difford

i see
and do you have an appointment

no but it be important and if you would

i be sorry but if you do not have an
appointment i will not be able to help you
if you would like you can call he office from
we courtesy phone outside and schedule
one

if Diffords not out here it one minute
we be calling the news and informing they
that you fuck game be whispering in
we ear and telling we to commit suicide
i be talking public relation nightmare
here buddy
satanism virgin sacrifice
backward message the whole bit

one moment please
rachel would you be kind enough to tell
mr
Difford that we have a situation in the
lobby which require he immediate attention
thankyou

mr
Difford will be right with you

why thankyou

virgin sacrifice

drive they crazy every time

nick alex how be we today

how do you know it be we

security camera
pull you file before i come down
be
careful what you say kid
i know where
you live

now what seem to be the problem

it be the game

you do not like it

that be get to be the understatement of the
century
it be killing people

if this be a joke i be not laughing

neither be we
something wrong with the
game mr
Difford

why do not we take this into i office


talk to i

there be something wrong with
the
game alive somehow

what alex be trying to say be that it
seem like it be alive

no i be not

freezing she with a
stare
we be not get very far into the level
and we kind of thought maybe we could talk
to a programmer learn some trick and
stuff
i mean you do not want we kid running
around school saying you game too hard
right

that be what this be all about
trick
sure i would be happy to introduce you to
arcade programmer

tell you what i will take you down to we
lab right now


this be one of we new project
we be
trying to get rid of joystick
altogether

the airforce be working on the same thing

come on come on

shit

albert

this be nick and alex
they would like to talk
to you about
maybe you can give
they a few programmer secret

yeah sure

then i leave you in capable hand

do that thing work

get there
it be more sensitive than a
joystick
you videocharacter can respond
as fast as you can
but what can i do for you

we be have some problem with

yeah who be not

what do you mean

it be a tough game
hard to pin that bastard
down
keep on changing the rule

we vere think there might be trick
you know surprise that you would worked into
the game

sure
every game get they
i will start
with the schematics
i can print these up
if you want

you have get you ten level right
here
they be
each level have an exit only
remember the exit be not always what they
seem
first one the blood red sky then you have
get the blue desert tower of ghost
kingdom of the blind
on each world you
have to find a golden key and you have only
get so much time to do it in
if you be
too late the screamer come

how do you stop the screamer

you can not
he get you and you be dead
it be like time catching up with you you
know
like fate
each level you get
progressively less time to complete
first
half of the game take place in the wild
land
then you reach level and that be
the sea of darkness
there be a twoheaded
boatman that take you across if you
answer he riddle right
if you do not

what be the riddle

if i tell you then it be no fun

just tell i the fuck riddle

well
it involve a paradox
you have to
trick the boatman
now all the while you also have to watch
you strength
you can build that back up
by catching
the little glow
guy

the next half of the game take place in
arcade brain the city of truth
it be
urban scenario lots of metal and concrete
screamer come fast here
on level four
you can get a free life if you wait until
the last possible second before exit that
world
get to time it right though

what be the question mark

level ten
that be where you have get to
unlock arcade heart use the key you have
find

how do you do that

good question
see that be where the fun
come in
change it every time
he be a machine without a soul
once you give
he a soul he stop be a threat

but how can it change every time

it be the game logic core
we actually
pattern it after human brainwave
i
mean there be a personality in there
that be what make it so incredible

how the hell do you do that

well we be veer into classify info
here but i will tell you that it involve a
donor
he be dead of course so it be not
like anything unethical be happening

dead

well braindead anyway
coma patient
it be really not all that important

maybe he be not dead

he

the donor
maybe he be alive inside the
game

and maybe you have be taking too many drug

could you play with that

well technically yes but this be only
the prototype

thanks albert
think you could print up
those schematic

sure

go outside get you car and meet i out
front with the engine run
and make it
quick okay

what be you going to do

get that helmet
if we be going to play
i want every advantage possible



here you go
happy hunt

thanks again

shit

that be he

on






jesus christ

i can not believe you make it

you get the schematics

everything

so where do we play the game nick

i have be think about that
arcade like a virus so it seem like the
place to hit he would be where the virus
start
you know like he point of origin

Dantes inferno

there be a skylight
we can get in through

okay
it be west

the key be suppose to be at the end of
each level
once we get all the key we
can unlock arcade heart
and then

and then we go to the final level
hey do not worry about it
it be a game
how bad could it be

the clock already ticking

right then


there

i do not get it
this be suppose to be the
end of the level but it do not go anywhere
