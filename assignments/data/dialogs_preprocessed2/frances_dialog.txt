no one ever come up to i and said
you be a fool
there be not such a
thing as god
Somebodys be stuffing
you




it be not a murder
i think god just
die of old age
and when i realized
he be not any more it do not shock
i
it seem natural and right



and yet i begin to wonder what the
minister mean when he said god
the father see even the small
sparrow fall
he watch over all
he child
that jumble it all
up for i



but still sometimes i find that god
be useful to remember especially
when i lost thing that be
important
please god let i find
i red hat with the blue trimming


it usually worked
god become a
superfather that could not spank i
but if i wanted a thing badly enough
he arranged it

but if god loved all of he child
equally why do he bother about i
red hat and let other people lose
they father and mother for always

bye baby

see you next weekend dad

i begin to see that he do not have
much to do about hat or people die
or anything
they happen whether
he wanted they to or not and he
stay in heaven and pretended not
to notice


i wonder a little why god be such
a useless thing
it seem a waste
of time to have he
after that he
become less and less until he be
nothingness

i feel rather proud that i have find
the truth myself without help from
anyone
it puzzled i that other
people have not find out too
god
be go
we have reach past he
why could not they see it
it still
puzzle i

the group be more than a theatre
company
it be the embodiment of an
ideal
we approach allow the actor
to be an artist in the full sense
a creative individual and an
instrument of change
you see

really mr
Clurman you do not have
to sell i

forgive i indulgence
seem we always
lecture those who be on time for
those who be tardy
the point be
mr
odets here have written a wonderful
play
most of the role be cast
but we have not find we female
lead

who be she

she be a tramp from newark

forgive i but i think you would be
perfect for the part

miss farmer for i this be not a
play
it be an assault
a
seduction
a plea for understand
i think we live in a time when new
art works should shoot bullet
and you make very attractive
ammunition

and what be the title of this seduc
assault

golden boy


hi

no one will quash
you here but it be still a fight a
struggle
be true to you art
be honest be always a struggle

not only an artist but an
instrument of change
we must look
to the world around we not content
to observe but to take an active
hand in redress it wrong
we
will not stand idly by as fascist
bomb obliterate democracy
we
contribute we profit for if fascism
be not stopped in spain it will
spread across europe jeopardize
the struggle of civilized man to
survive
present check to

the artist to be vital must be a
soldier too

i be not afraid of struggle clifford

the first
step be to acknowledge we fear

face it

perhaps it would be good if you said
you goodbye here

oh
well i have some background
that you should probably know about
if you be

i have no doubt mrs
farmer

i be glad to see you have not lost
you sense of humor

i be looking forward to resolve
you predicament

oh
be you really

among person such as yourself
creative people under great stress
erratic behavior be not at all
uncommon and certainly nothing to be
ashamed of
it be just that the
neurosis which fuel you talent can
also generate certain character
disability which
can cripple you
ability to function


do you expect i for one moment to
believe you have great insight
into i personality than i do

please sit down

you may discuss i predicament
doctor
you may discuss it with anyone
you like but not with i

want to make i

and what be that

normal
average

all right

one merely insert the leucotome
beneath the eyelid and press up
into the prefrontal lobe manipulating
it so as to sever the nervous
connection between the thalamofrontal
radiation and the body of the brain




because of the speed and simplicity
of the operation i be able as you
be seeing to perform the procedure
on ten patient in less than a half
hour




the operation be completely painless
and can be perform without any
sedative whatsoever


we have always known that this form
of radical treatment be effective
but until now it could not be applied
on a large scale
the old procedure
required a full day work by a
surgical team to perform a single
operation
in the same time work
alone i can treat fifty


this procedure work best on patient
with extreme overreactions to
emotional stimulus
it can also be
used as a last resort on those who
seem impervious to other form of
treatment


in plain language i technique sever
the nerve which give emotional energy
to idea
along with the cure come
a loss of affect
a kind of
emotional flatten


with diminished creativity and
imagination
patient become like
good solid cake with no ice
but
after all it be they emotion and
imagination that be disturbed


these patient will soon be leaving
the hospital


lobotomy get they home


what be i saying
oh yes it be
the communist that do it to frances

they capture the mind by first
seducing the heart
i suppose i never
taught frances to close she heart
