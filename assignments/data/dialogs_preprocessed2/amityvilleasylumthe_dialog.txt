working together

oh great

we work night so today we will just
show you around okay

okay thank you

i will clean this up and we will get to
it


this be the storage cupboard
everything you will need for each











yes
i think a lot of the time it be
the staff do it not the
patient
but we have this GumCart
which be a bit complicate but it be
easier than just scraping the gum
the steam be super heated to one
hundred eighty degree and
deliver at seven point zero bar
pressure
it can produce a hundred
and fifteen litre of superheat
steam per minute

be it okay if i watch you use it a
few time first so i know exactly
what i be do
i do not want to end
up burning myself or any furniture

no problem
now here we come to the
most dangerous chemical we have
this be a concrete cleaner very
toxic stuff so you have to wear
the face mask and glove we have
here okay

okay

this be for cleaning and descale
brick stone and concrete and for
metal derusting
for concrete you
must mix it one part to four part
water
brush or spray it on with
the equipment here then leave it
five to ten minute to set then
rinse it off
but for those
stubborn sonofabitch mark use
it neat

okay

do not worry if anything seem
complicate you will get used to it
but you will mostly be mopping and
hoover in you first few week


yeah that be fine


this be ward one of two ward
you will be responsible for clean
each evening
essentially the main
duty will be emptying the bin
hoover the carpet area and
mopping the hallway
the patient
in here be category
they be
mainly people who have have nervous
breakdown and those who be
catatonic
they be harmless
like
missus Hardesty here

hello missus Hardesty

she have not spoken a word in all she
time here
the orderly just lift
she from the bedroom to the day
room and back again every day

why do you just talk to she

we have still get to treat they like
human being
otherwise they just
become like furniture and we all
lose we humanity
i like to think
she can hear i even if she will not
talk to i
see you late missus
Hardesty



the patient be locked in they
room on we night shift but now
and again they might have an
accident we get to clean up

okay

in the day time there be nurse
who often clean up but in the night
we may be called to provide fresh
linen or mop up
not the most
pleasant of job but it happen
from time to time

yeah i understand

now here we come to the most
difficult part of the job

cleaning crap up be not the most
difficult part

oh no that be very easy compare to
what be behind this door

what be behind it

this lead down to ward


sound ominous

you could say that
it be where
category patient be hold
the
criminally insane

really
doctor Mixter do not
mention that

yes well these patient be
beyond help so they have become athe
hospital secret
many of they
be transferred from prison and
other institution
doctor Mixter
probably think he could help
they
he can not
the staff call this
place blood row



what be that smell

it always hang in the air
no
matter how much we bleach the floor
there be always that smell of
death


these patient be dangerous

yes
but do not worry we never have
to interact directly or anything
like that
you will just be mopping
the corridor and dust

that be jerry kimble
he be
convict of stab a young
mother fortynine time in front of
she two yearold son then killing
and sexually assault a woman
before smothering she fouryearold
daughter
they call he the green
chain rapist
he be in sing sing
but be certified insane and he
lawyer get he transferred here
he
do not make any noise or fuss but
he be a dangerous man
especially
towards woman
this next inmate be
even bad

that be dennis palmer
also known as
the long island cannibal
he be
abused as a child so he target
be always paedophile and
rapist
he would track they down and
torture they
he would eat part of
they body while they be still
alive


that be horrible

the most horrible thing be that a
lot of the public think he be a
hero

sadie Krenwinkel

what be she deal

she be a member of a witchcraft
cult
they kidnap six people for
a demonic ritual
five be killed
but one get away and lead police to
the cult
she turned she trial into
a circus talking about lots of
crazy stuff
the media enjoy it
but she get certified insane by the
court
she be be around a few
institution since
now she be here

some strange story here

well those be not the strange

really

this last patient be the strange
case

this be we resident john doe
sometimes we have people with

amnesia
often we find out who they
be
not so with this man

why be he down here

they first bring he in about six
month ago
no one know where he
come from he literally just turn
up late one night
an orderly find
he wandering the ground
first of
all he be like missus Hardesty
upstairscatatonic
then a few
week later he start to respond
to doctor Mixter and the nurse
through facial expression and
gesture
but soon he get violent
very violent
he would have burst of
rage and beat other patient
one
day he appear to have a seizure
and collapsed
young doctor tried
to take he vital sign
patient
here throttle he so hard he
crushed he larynx
it take six
orderly to restrain he
now they
will not even let he out for the
obligatory hour a day exercise
we
still do not know who he be

oh god

man

i have not put you off have i

i guess not
it be just a lot to
take in
i have obviously never be
around stuff like this before

this be the reality of this place
we do not deal with these people
directly but we may have to clean
up they mess

world that many people believe be
created by a love god

i do not believe that god be a
bearded man who life in the sky
or that the devil be a red demon
with horn
i believe god and satan
be within all of we
god be we
human side
satan be we animal
side
whether we become good or
evil depend which side of we we
feed

it be a frighten thing to believe
that if god exist he be not
powerful enough to stop evil

free will in the hand of a person
who feed the evil inside they
that be what frighten i

doctor Mixter must have known what
stand on this land before the
hospital

of course he do
he buy the
land and organised the demolition
of the house himself

why would he build on this land
knowing the history of the place

he be not superstitious
he be a
doctor they do not usually believe
in those thing
amityville be full
of local legend going back even
before the DeFeos

like what

there be story about the native
american be slaughter on this
land many year ago
some people

even believe the indian chief
possess that kid who killed his
family

really

i do not think that be true
if i have
learn anything from the patient
on ward it be that some people
have a mind that work in a
different way to other people
those people who do bad thing have
feed the evil within they more than
the good
it be not possession it be
sickness
sickness of the soul

i do not know what to think

just do not let you imagination run
away with you lisa
you be a person
who feed that good within you
do not let this place feed the evil


hi sorry to bother you but i
name lisa templeton
i ring
yesterday to set up a meet with
gloria branco

yes that be i

oh great
thank you for agree to
meet with i

no problem nice to meet you
i have
set up a table in the back
i have

get a few book that may help you
with you inquiry

thank you that be great


so you wanted to know about the
history of amityville dating back
to the native american

yes that be right
i be writing a
college paper and i have hear some
rumour in the neighbourhood about
native american be killed on
the land down on ocean avenue

well that area have quite a dark
history

you mean the DeFeo murder at one
twelve

yes
terrible business that
those
young child
break i heart to
think about such a tragedy

yeah it be awful

you know most of the town be very
upset when they decided to build
that mental institution on the
land
that used to be a nice
suburban neighbourhood now there be
this big eye sore there
we have a

thousand name on a petition
but i
guess that doctor who run the
place have enough money to pay off
the people in high place

so what about the native american
be that story about they be
killed on that land true

there be something on that here

ah yes here it be
in
the th century there exist a
group of native american in
amityville known as the Satchem
tribe lead by Satchem Takapausha
the chief
the tribe have flee salem
in massachusetts to escape
persecution by the christian who
be persecute member of the
tribe because of they witchcraft
practice
these practice included
a ritualistic human sacrifice of
six people the significance of six
be related to the biblical
number of man and creation in
order to induce the spirit of they
god the dark master who they
believe manifest he power
through he devote follower
giving they immortality
the
hundred strong tribe settled in
amityville but be later chase
off the land by local christian
Satchem accused the christian of
not properly compensating he tribe
for the land
war start and the
christian hired a hunter called
john underhill from salem
at the
site where one twelve ocean avenue
be later build in amityville
underhill killed all of the tribe
the indian be buried in a mass
grave on the site
before he die
Satchem vow revenge
accord to
local legend chief Satchem be
believe to have subsequently
haunted the land
various
parapsychologist and medium have

claim that Satchems vengeful
spirit influence the DeFeo
murder at one twelve ocean avenue
and the haunting of the subsequent
owner
although such assertion
be widely dispute

so the legend have basis in
historical fact

absolutely


you told i the other night that
you think evil be within we all
but do you think that people can be
influence by an evil that come
from outside of themselves

be you still think about this

i guess i be yeah

i worry that you be think too
much
this place be get to you

there be something going on in this
place
something sinister
and i
do not just mean the patient on
ward
have you not notice that

i have notice some thing

why have not you said anything
or
do anything


it be like the honey bee

what do you mean

the honey bee be fine when it be
just flying from flower to flower
then they think that a person be a
threat and they sting they
they
might leave a sting but the person
will recover
the bee die
so i
ask myself
be it worth it






i know what you be do

i have see that blog
how be you
get access to the internet

be you allow to have all this
stuff in you cell huh

the DeFeo
murder and the infamous house that
people said be haunted

it be common perception now that a
lot of that be exaggerated by the
media

maybe
be you aware of the history
of the land dating back to the
eighteenth century

no i can not say that i be


there be a group of native
american in amityville known as
the Satchem tribe
they be
massacr by christian after a
dispute over the land

okay
i be sure there be a point to
all this

yes
sadie Krenwinkel down on ward

she share the belief of the
Satchem tribe
i have reason to
believe that somehow she have access
to the internet and witchcraft
paraphernalia and she be planning on
a human sacrifice tonight to try
and raise the god she believe in
the dark master and become
immortal

i be serious

and we be back with we next guest
year ago he be a survivor of the
high hope hospital mass murder
when cleaner lisa templeton run
amok with a rifle claiming six
victim and injure many other
doctor elliot Mixter have written a
new book entitled shattered hope
which provide an account of that
fateful night as well as some
background into the mind of the
murderer
doctor Mixter good
morning

morning katherine how be you

i be good thank you
so doctor can
you tell we a little more about the
book

well it feature a blow by blow
account of the evening
it be
obviously a very harrow
experience and for i it be rather
therapeutic to deal with i
feeling about what happen in
write

how have it affected the hospital
doctor

obviously we be all left very
numb by event for a long time and
i know a lot of people in the town
feel we should close the
institution
but that never
occur to i
i feel that people
should be bring closer by tragedy
and the staff and i have definitely
become closer both as colleague
and friend since the incident
that bond make for a good

institution in i opinion so we
will continue to go from strength
to strength

you mention there that some
people wanted the place to close
i
know many be also resistant to
the open of the institution in
the first place given that it be
build on the site of the infamous
house where ronald DeFeo murdered
he family in the seventies
i know
a lot of people associated with
that case be accuse of
exploiting it for they own end
you have also face some criticism
for that particularly as we hear
last week that you have sell the
movie right to this book
how do
you respond to that criticism

well i know that some people accuse
i of hurting the memory of the
victim but i feel i be helping the
memory of those involve live on
grant some victim be
criminally insane but other victim
be loyal staff who have family
and i be determine that they not be
forgotten
each staff member get
they own chapter in the book so
that the reader can get a full
picture of what wonderful people
they be
i always say that all
form of media whether it be
book newspaper or movie
be a preservation of life
we
physical body may die but we
image live on when we be famous
we work and we passion be
preserve therefore it be as if we
soul be preserve
through all of
these form of media we be in
effect immortal
