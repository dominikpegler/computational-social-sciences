tech
tick left
kane set they
down




coach this be the second year in a
row you have failed to go to a bowl
game
do you feel you program in
decline

no we be just a young team on the
verge
we will be back in a major bowl
next year

good throw joe
it be there

so be half they team
shit another christmas at home

next year man
next year we sell
out
next year we dominate

you still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with joe kane
what be you going to do to address
this need

stop wastine i time talkin to you
guy for a start



i be not going to lead you into the fog
here sam

i be concern about we program
it be always be a source of pride
to we student and alumni but two
straight soso season be have a
damage effect on we fundraise
both public and private

then stop raising the entrance
requirement on i
we never could
have get alvin mack in here under
the new guideline

as chancellor i first responsibility
be to the academic interest of this
university

at a time when we be committed to a
million dollar build program
alumni donation be down the
last two year
because they have also
voice they displeasure to they
legislator we can expect a
correspond drop in state fund

the athletic fund be suffering too
season ticket sales be off
merchandise slow

you layin all this at i door
there be be a recession on

yes but the heavy drop have be
from the big donor the
dollar club
these people be
recession proof
they sit in i box
every game and they be much more
generous when we be ranked and going
to bowl game
two of they as you
know be on the board of regents
including the chairman

what be you trying to say to i
grant
after year i job in
jeopardy

i be not prepare to discuss you job
right now
i just want you to be
aware of the situation
the alumni
and the legislature be unhappy and
they vote with they checkbooks
i
do not pretend to be an expert on
football sam and i will deny that
this conversation ever take place
but i do know we need to win next
year

ticket be in you coat
itinerary
and player profile be in you
briefcase

am tomorrow

yes but i be really more concern
with Darnells education
he come

believe i education be the first
priority in we program
that be why
all the player be smart than i

what the hell be that suppose to
mean

good to see you again gentleman
catching sight of
darnell
jefferson either take off the earring
or put on a dress

i want to talk a little about what
we be trying to do here
there be
many highly respected people who
feel football be about preparation
for life

these people be full of shit
you
see football be not like life
it be good
more exciting more
intense more fun
in life people
be always wonder how they measure
up
whether they be get ahead or
fallin behind
in football you
know
every week you get a chance to
show what you be make of a chance
to demonstrate the physical and
personal quality that all those
poor bastard who can not play this
game be left to agonize about

last year we do not make enough of
those chance
last year everyone
feel we let the school down
fuck
the school
we let ourselves down
pointing to the wall
of honor
we let down a great tradition a
yearold line of champion

any football program worth the name
be a special brotherhood an elite
corps of warrior a select group of
knight
that first time we start
unit take the field the first time
we huddle up
that be we inner circle
that be we round table
if i be an
upperclassman i would be real nervous
about i seat because we get some
very talented newcomer this year
guy who want a place at the table
producing Darnells
trophy from behind
the podium
this be the trophy one of we
freshman darnell jefferson win as
a pennsylvania state high school
first team AllAmerican
you know
what this say to i

not a goddamn thing

everybody here be a high school all
american
whatever any of you have do before
be out the window
we be startin
over
ground zero
the table be empty
be you ready


he be too pumped up
tryin to win
the damn Heisman on every throw
i be
not sure he be ready for all this
hype

little late to be worryin about
that
if we do not follow up the sport
illustrate cover with something
it will look like we do not believe in
we own player

do not worry joes a tough kid
he will
be allright

hey nice wrthe jefferson
you
get all the move

allright move it up
let we go
yard run the next play

cut the necktie tackle horseshit
you think you be in some kinda
highlight reel
he left you huggin
air
target he guts
drive right
through he abdomen
i wanta see
snot bubble in he nose
i wanta
see shit in he underwear

you injured jefferson or just hurt

what do you mean

if you be hurt you can still play
if you be injure you can not
be you
hurt or be you injure

i think i be just hurt


k
then get up

nice run
think what it coulda do
for we if we still have the ball
this be a football
i want you to
carry it with you wherever you go
never let it out of you sight
to the rest of the
team
any of you see he on campus take a
swipe at the ball
try to knock it
out of he hand
recover it
if anybody but you return this
ball to i you will wish you never
be born



this be not going to get it goddamnit

i see tackling but i do not see
hitting
i see effort but i do not
see ferocity
what do you think
they be going to motivate themselves
football just a game to most of
these kid
this be we program we
livelihood
it be we job to make
they care as much about it as we do
make they hate i if you have to
it will bring they together give they
a focus
so get off you butt and
put the fear of god in these guy

shit Lattimers an animal all of a
sudden
Benchin

on something

what steroid
why do you always
think i guy be juicin

i do not know
he be on the punt
team for three year then gain
pound of rip in one summer and an
attitude to go with it

we be not doctor gentleman
the
have test program for this

on pound in a summer if you
really hit the gym

i would do with you

what be that

thanks for the game Heisman
you
take it really well

what be this Heisman crap

i do not say anything about be a
Heisman candidate
i do not go around
strokin myself about it
so what be
this shit you be givin i

i
i be sorry
i just figure you
be probably kissin yourself in
the mirror every morning

you figure wrong

so what do you want an apology
i
just give you one

i want a rematch

rematch

some other sport
i take i beat
you owe i one
either that or we go
out

i will think about it

real good date joe
remind i to
take she out


darnell i have review you placement
test and i be afraid you failed to
meet we entrance requirement in
two area

what do that mean
i can not play
football

no
it mean you be going to have to
take some remedial class what we
call zero level course
specifically math and english

you will not get college credit for
they but they will help you prepare
to take the placement test again at
the end of the quarter
if you pass
at that time you will be able to
officially enter the university and
take college level course
you will
still be able to take an american
history survey course but it will not
count on you record until you pass
the placement test
but first thing
first
to start i be approving a
tutor for you

tutor
i do not need no tutor

any tutor
and yes you do

i think both joe and the university
be best serve by a straightforward
Heisman campaign
nothing too
gimmicky

we have compiled a mail list of
around opinion maker
newspaper football writer and
sport anchor
first we send they a
packet on joe and he achievement
bio stat plus human interest stuff
commitment to academic charity
work etc
then we update it each
week with a postcard
Heisman voter
hate open envelope

i have not really do any charity
work

you be going to start
we have get some
thing line up

unfortunately because we be not in
the top last year we only have
one network

game to give joe
national exposure
although it be a
good one
michigan
but we will also
be taping all we other game and
buying satellite time
that way we
can produce we own highlight package
and interview piece and send they
out to

station all over the
country for they sportscasts

any question joe

ah no
i just
you really think
i get a shot to win this

hell yes
plus it be a good thing
for the program
publicize the
school give a boost to recruit
and it be a great thing for you
jump
up you draft position the size of
you first contract everything
it be a hell of an opportunity

all you get to do be back it up on
the field and we have no doubt
about that because we know kane be
able


hello

this be joe kane
what do you decide

what
it be
in the morning

i wanta know what you decided

i do not know
i could not think of

lattimer know about it

as the veteran player know we have
pride night every year before we
open game
it be a chance to get
to know each other good share
some thought and bring we closer
together as a team
so to start off
i would like each player to tell the
other in he group what he like
best about football and then what
he be most proud of off the field

football
we be the lucky one

the thing i be most proud of myself
for



just that i be here

the great thing about football be
you can lose yourself in it



there be no time to think to worry
to have doubt

you just move and react

the good thing be when you dominate
that feel when you hit a guy real
good really stick he and you hear

junior college here

i could easily take you case to the
board of regents
you have have no prior
infraction and i could argue that
you be under abnormal pressure
but i will not
you embarrassed i you
embarrassed i family you embarrassed
the program
as of now you be no
longer a member of this university
or it be football team
clean out
you locker

we ready jerry


let we mark
it

joe this game be be bill as a
potential Heisman shootout
do
you feel any add pressure this
week



knowing that you be going head to
head with Heisman rival tim Waymen

well you know you try to block it
out but it be basically impossible
everybody seem to be talkin about
it all the newspaper the
interview



the hype on

tryin to get
something goin

hold it
hold it

what
what be the problem

what you be saying be true of course
but i do not think it be the message
you want to send



it make you seem a little nervous
like the pressure might be get
to you

this game be nationally televise
so most Heisman voter will be
watch
i think a more casual
approach be good
modest
controlled casual

we all set now
let we mark it
joe this game be be bill as a
potential Heisman shootout




do you feel any add pressure this
week knowing that you be going head

all that

one
two undefeated team going after
each other
michigan up by four
but the lead have changed hand
three time and you get the feel
that whoever have the ball last be
going to win it



well it be bill as a Heisman
shootout and it be be all of that
both Waymen and kane moving they
team up and down the field have
big day



kane back to pass can not find anybody
going to run it himself ten five hit
at the goalline
touchdown

blitz Waymen be goin for it all
hit as he throw

jefferson in for griffen



ball on the michigan
to go
kane bring they to the line of
scrimmage



great run by jefferson the highly
tout freshman the long of the
day for the wolf
and this one be
turning out to be everything we
think it would be



time to put the woman and
child to bed and go looking for
dinner

strike eagle crown on



kane looking for jefferson
it be
intercepted
intercepted by freeman
and that should do it

well it be everything we expect
it to be
fine performance on both
side of the field



the edge in the much ballyhooed battle
of the quarterback would probably
have to go to Michigans tim Waymen
who threw for touchdown and run
for another
joe kane account for
three

you
touchdown but have
that crucial interception in the
wane moment
and that prove to
be the difference

it be not awkward
it be educational
i realized how you see i
i be good
enough to tutor to go place with

that be not it
it be just that i
father expect i to be with somebody
like ray
he would not understand we

why not

i do not know
he like ray because

he be a good student he act right
he do not need football
he be class
and i be not right

i do not say that

you do not have to autumn
i be
everything you dad used to be and
do not want you fallin back into

darnell

you be right before autumn
i
should have another tutor
thanks
for everything you do for i



four fuckin week

shit the defense be going to have to
pitch shutouts now
and you be go for
what the hell
do you take that shit for

nobody seem to mind when i be
knockin people dick in the dirt

i bust chop too
i do not have to
get all fucked up

not everybody have the ability you
do alvin
you do what you have to
do to play

well you be not playin much now
be you
shit whole fuckin season
down the drain

i be talkin to chancellor wilson

what be he wanta do now cut practice
down to once a week

no he be happy with the way the
season go so far
the alumni
have pretty much stay off he back
but with joe out now it could all
be up for grab again

he think he be going to have trouble
marchin the ball down the old fund
raisine board huh

the fact be all we have left be
freshman quarterback and nothing i
see at practice today convinced i
that any of they be ready to step
in

what be you sayin

we get to get bobby collins back

wilson say that

he do not have to

forget it galen collins be no all
star either

yeh but he be good enough to get we
a split of the next four game

look just because you be wilsons
boy all of a sudden do not mean
i be going to let he make i look like
a fuckin whore

do not give i that high and mighty
shit
there be a lotta people on the
bubble here
four straight lose and
we be out of bowl contention
how be
that going to make you look
if you be
too stupid to consider you own
situation then maybe you oughta
think about you assistant coach
they have get family to feed too

therefore i respectfully submit
that bobby collins should not be
give special treatment just because
he be a football player
would a
regular student get a reinstatement
hearing if they be catch
cheating
Nobodys talking about
letting the girl who take the test
back in

i think it be also instructive to
look at some of the course this
young man have taken
begin golf
voice and speech improvement

i would like to point out that mr
collins
be still on schedule to get his
degree

pointing to collins
transcript
in what swim pool management

would you like to respond coach
winter

i do not know much about all this
other stuff but i do know the
punishment should fit the crime
Cheatings bad but i do not think it
deserve a life sentence
here one
of those athlete who take college
level course who want to graduate
i think bobby collins make a big
mistake but he be already be
suspended for several week
he be
serve he time
i think he deserve
a second chance

like alvin mack
we give he a second
chance and since he be have
incompletes withdrawal and still
read at a fourth grade level
you be
use he body to make money for the
athletic department you yourself
be making three time what the
chancellor be but obviously no
one be making an effort to see that
this kid get an education

he be helpin to pay for you physics
lab too
if you be willin to go
without a new office maybe i could
hold he out a few game
save his
body

gentleman

alvin be way behind in school when
he get here
you can not make up for
in four year what it take to
create

then he should never have be
admitted in the first place
it be
not fair to other student who worked
hard to get here

be it fair to exclude kid who come
from inferior school
you hold
everybody to the same standard
you be discriminating against the
poor kid

most of i player be farm boy
innercity kid
football be they
deliverance

deliverance from what
valid
education

you throw bobby collins and alvin
out you take away they future
in
Alvins case you probably cost he a
couple million dollar in the pro

but this be not a football vocational
school
it be an institute of high
learn

yeh but when be the last time
people show up to watch a kid do a
chemistry experiment

gentleman please let we get back to
the business at hand bobby collins
as you know i play football here
and i remember how hard it be to
practice and then study when you be
dead tire
so i have some sympathy
for this young man
but i never
cheated so the real question be his
character
since you know he good
than anyone else in this room
and
have talk to he and observe
he over the last several week do
you feel he be learned he lesson
in
other word can you vouch for his
character

all the way up to the governor
