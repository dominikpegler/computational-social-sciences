










none of this would have happen if mr
mcallister have not meddle the way he
do
he should have just accepted
thing as they be instead of trying to
interfere with destiny
you see you
can not interfere with destiny
that be
why it be destiny
and if you try to
interfere the same thing going to
happen anyway and you will just suffer

morning lowell

Twentyone
twentytwo

good luck

good morning mr
mcallister

not wasting any time be you tracy

you know what they say about the early
bird

yes i do

well good luck there tracy

thanks mr


no matter what he say mr
mcallister
have it out for i from the start
oh
sure he be all smile and good wish
and everything but underneath he be
just as unfair and petty as anybody
else

he will probably tell you how commit
he be to teach and democracy and
integrity and all
do not be fool

it be hard to remember how the whole
thing start the whole election mess
what i do remember be that i loved i
job
i be a teacher an educator and i
could not imagine do anything else

hey mr

mr


stop daydream
get back to work

the student know it be not just a job
for i

mon wolverine
defense
let we
hold they back

i get involve
and i care

and i think i make a difference

i know i touched the student live
during they difficult young adult
year and i take that responsibility
seriously

in the twelve year i taught you

history civic and current event at
millard i be vote teacher of the year
three time a school record

standing in front of a room full of
young people trying to make they think
that be how i wanted to spend the rest
of i life

so would this be an ethical situation
or a moral situation
what be the
difference between ethics and moral
anyway

anybody

derek

uh ethics be like when you uh do
what society tell you be right and
moral be like uh

you be on the right track who can
help he out

moral be when

michelle

moral be like lesson you know like
the moral of a story
it be what you
learn from a story or a fable or
something



or a life experience
good
and
ethics

that be more like urn
ethics be how
you use the moral
that you learn
from a story

okay
but we be still miss
something key here
what be we
miss

i know

tracy

ethics be

tracy flick
tracy flick
i have never
meet anyone quite like tracy flick

she first show up in i life as a
freshman delegate in student council
i would see a lot of ambitious student
come and go over the year but i could
tell right away tracy flick be
different

it be not long before everyone know who
tracy flick be
she make sure of that
she drive be astonishing
even scary

some people say i be an overachiever
but i think they be just jealous

i mom always tell i i be different
you know special
and if you look at
all the thing i have accomplished so far
i think you would have to agree

here i be in oklahoma

i be just a girl who can not say no

and here i be on we studentrun
station

that be why principal hendrick make
the controversial announcement that the
litter must stop
tracy flick
report

but it be in the student
government association where i make i
big mark
i never missed a meet
and i volunteer for every committee as
long as i could lead it

i agree with ashley
we should rent
the barrel at least a day beforehand
what happen last time be a travesty
i mean we be

trying to quiet
she
yeah no i know tracy
that be why
we be look can we just take a vote
on this

now at the end of she junior year
tracy be poised to win the presidency
of the student body
and so far she be
running unopposed

the rule of conduct determined by a
culture at a

oh
there be one more thing about tracy
i think you should know

she pussy get so wet you can not believe
it

few month before the election she would
have an affair with i good friend dave
Novotny

do not tell i that
i do not want to
know that

she be incredible
everything just get
soak

dave come to millard the year after i
do and we hit it off right away
we
backed each other up in teacher
meeting and shared an interest in s
music and microbreweries

you could tell dave be one of those
guy who taught because they never
wanted to leave high school in the first
place and that could get a little
irritate sometimes but basically he
be a real good guy

foxy


foxy


you know you be a
cute little heartbreaker
foxy
you
know you be a sweet little love maker

we wife become good friend too
and
when dave and Sherrys son darryl be
born they ask we to be godparent

probably think the bad that mr
Novotny be just taking advantage of one
of he student but it be not like that
at all
we relationship be base on
mutual respect and admiration
i mean
during i sophomore year in geometry it
be strictly professional between we
i mean nothing

it be not until junior year when we
work together on the yearbook that
thing get serious

one night he take we editor out to
celebrate after a deadline
eventually
dave and i be left alone and we get to
talking not like teacher and student
but like two adult

you know tracy
i do not know how to
say this but

what

well i notice you do not seem to have
any close friend at millard
you seem
to be kind of a loner

no i be not
i be just really busy

i know
i know it not by choice
i
just mean well be the kind of
person you be it must be really
difficult to find someone you can talk
to

what do you mean
what kind of person
be i

what kind of person

tracy i have be watch you for going
on two year now and i think you be
one of the most talented hardworking
sensitive attractive brilliant
student no human being i have
ever meet
i mean you be the real
thing
special

thank you

and i know sometimes people like you
have to pay a price for they greatness
and that price be loneliness

i do not know
maybe i be wrong
but it
seem like you might need a friend

since i grow up without a dad you
might assume psychologically i be
looking for a father figure

but that have nothing to do with it at
all
it be just that dave be so
strong and make i feel so safe and
protected

it be the first time somebody ever see
the real i the i that nobody else
know

here get down

look at you

when i think back on i relationship
with mr
Novotny what i miss most
be
we talk

you do it at you house
you own
house

look jim
okay
i know it all
seem crazy and maybe it do start out
you know for the
for the sex and the
danger
but now it be different
jim
what i be trying to tell you be that
tracy and i be totally totally in
love

in love

yeah it be serious
i mean she
inspire i in way sherry never have
she even want to read i novel

but you have not written you novel

that be the whole point
it be all in i
head
it be right here
i just get to
get it out there
tracy want i to
write it so she can read it
it be
beautiful

dave i be just saying this as you
friend
what you be do be really
really wrong and you have get to stop

you be not just jealous be you
i
mean we both used to talk about she

that be just talk
fantasy talk
what
be you nut
we talk about girl all
the time but it do not mean anything
i would never


i mean i take very
seriously we strict moral code
the
line you have cross be
it be illegal
and it be immoral

i do not need a lecture on ethics jim
okay
i know what

i be not talking about ethics
i be
talking about moral

peekaboo

to jim
whispering
look i appreciate you concern
i
really do
but like i said i get it
under control

i guess i do not have to tell you how
all this turned out

tracys mom she do not understand

no i would say she do not
i do not think
i have ever see a mother quite so upset
we be all very very lucky she do not
want this public

but we be in love

dave
dave look at i

i want you to get some help


after dave get fire sherry kick he
out of the house and file for divorce

little room saying the exact same thing
year after year for he whole life
wearing the same stupid clothes while
he student go on to good college and
move to big city and do great thing
and make load of money have get to be at
least a little jealous
it be like i
room say the weak always try to
sabotage the strong

one thing that be important to know
about i be that i be an only child
so
i mom be really devote to i and i
love she so much
she want i to do
all the thing she wanted to do in life
but could not

see mom used to be a stewardess for
northwest and now work as a paralegal
she like to write letter to successful
woman like janet reno and elizabeth dole
and ask they how they get to be where
they be and what advice do they have
for i tracy she daughter

nine time out of ten they say you have
to hold on to you dream no matter
what
the pressure woman face mean you
have to work twice as hard and you
can not let anything or anyone stand in
you way

one per person

eat i

Ninetyseven

everything
if you play fair and follow
all the rule thoroughly you will always
come out ahead
win or lose ethical
conduct be the most important thing

mcallister

paul

why



why




i be so mad at god when i broke i leg
at shadow ridge over christmas break

the doctor told i i would have to quit
sport for at least a couple year if
not forever

which mean no firststring
quarterback in the fall
it be like the
end of i life

when i get back to school everybody be
so supportive and they all wanted to
sign i cast and everything

but i still could not shake the
feeling that now i life have no purpose
what do god want from i

why do i exist

sometimes you can search everywhere for
answer
then one day destiny just tap
you on the shoulder
i know because it
happen to i

paul could i talk to you for a minute

mr
mcallister changed i life
and no
matter what they say he do or do not
do i believe he be a good man

paul i know you have be pretty down
since you accident

i wanted to play next year so bad i
could taste it
and maybe go on to

i know
i understand disappointment
i really do

yeah

but you have get a big choice right now
you can choose to be depress about it
for the rest of you life
or you can
choose to see it for what it really be
an opportunity
i personally think you
have a big future ahead of you and i
do not mean the fleet glory of sport

what do you mean

let i give you a clue
you be a bear
leader
you be one of the most popular
student at millard
you be honest and
straightforward
you do not choke under
pressure as we all see in that amazing
fourth quarter against westside
the
other kid look up to you
what do
that spell

student
council
president

who i
nooo
i never
i do not
know anything about that stuff mr

besides that be tracy flick thing
she be always working so hard and

yeah no she be a gogetter all right

and she be supernice

yeah
but one person assure of
victory kind of undermine the whole
idea of a democracy do not it
that be
more like a
well like a
dictatorship like we studied

paul what be you favorite fruit

huh
oh
uh
pear

take a piece of chalk from the lip of
the blackboard

okay let we say

no wait apple
apple

fine
let we say all you ever know be
apple
apple apple and more apple
you might think apple be pretty good
even if you occasionally get a rotten
one
then one day there be an orange
and
now you can make a decision
do you want
an apple or do you want an orange
that be democracy

i also like banana

exactly
so what do you say
maybe
it be time to give a little something
back

the right side be too high
the right
side
just a smidge

hey paul you going over to anthonys
on friday or what do you decide

i get to talk to he first

who put you up to this

who put you up to this

what do you mean

you just wake up this morning and
suddenly decided to run for president

and everything but he just said he
think it be a good idea
and how

it be nothing against you tracy
you be the good
i just think

okay mr
popular

Metzier have decided to run against i
but nothing could be far from the
truth
he be no competition for i
it
be like apple and orange
it just
mean i have to work a little hard
that be all

you see i believe in the voter
they
understand that election be not just
popularity contest
they know this
country be build by people just like i
who work very hard and do not have
everything hand to they on a silver
spoon

not like some rich kid who everybody
like because they father own Metzier
cement and give they truck on they
sixteenth birthday and throw they big
party all the time
they do not ever
have to work for anything

they think they can all of a sudden one
day out of the blue waltz right in with
no qualification whatsoever and try to
take away what other people have work
for very very hard they entire live
no it do not bother i at all i

turn out to be such a lie

i mean lisa and i be destine to be
together
it be so obvious
of all the
people on the planet who have ever live
somehow we would find each other

lisa

experiment with asparagus to see how
long it take you pee to smell
we pee
a little every five minute

for she it take about fifteen minute
and for i it be twenty

everyday i find some new way to tell
lisa i loved she

if you die right now i would throw
myself into one of i dad cement
truck and get pour into you tomb

but it just seem like the close we
get the more she pulled away

be you crazy

what

people can see this

to make they good
with this
election we here at millard also have
an opportunity to make we high school
day well
during this campaign i
have have the opportunity to speak with
many of you about you concern
i
speak with freshman eliza ramirez who
told i how alienate she feel from she
own homeroom
i speak with sophomore
reggie banks who said he mother work
in a cafeteria and can not afford to buy
he enough spiral notebook for he
class
i will not bore you with long
winded promise about all the new and
innovative thing i will definitely
achieve during the year in which it will
be i honor and privilege to represent
each and every one of you but i can say
that i year of experience on the
student council have taught i the three
most important attribute the president
need to possess
commitment

eat i

eat i raw

if you can not be adult and give these
candidate the courtesy they deserve
then you do not deserve to be called
adult but child because that be what
child be
and you will be treated like
child
so let we all listen up

the three most important attribute the
president need to possess be
commitment qualification and
experience
i will add one more
caring
i care about millard and i care about
each and every one of you and together
we can all make a difference
one of
the thing i would like to establish be
a regular open forum where any student
can come and voice they concern about
issue we face here at millard
i and
the rest of the student council would
then interface with the faculty and
staff so a continuous dialogue would
exist

i would say she know a thing or two about
studentfaculty dialogue

when you cast you vote for tracy flick
next week you will not just be voting for
i
you will be voting for yourself and
for every other student we day will not
be any long but they can sure be
well
thank you

the next candidate for student body
president be paul Metzier
paul

as many of you know i broke i leg
pretty bad thi year and the experience
have make i reevaluate what i want to do
with i life and that be help people
when you think about it a school be more
than a school it be we second home where
we spend all cur time and grow as
individual and a community but be we
school everything it could be i want we
school to reach it true potential that
be why i be running for president

i know what it be to fight hard and win
like when we almost go to state last
fall and i threw that fourthquarter
pass against westside for the touchdown
that win the game by three point i
will not let you down like i do not then i
promise we can all score a win
touchdown together
vote paul Metzier
for president thank you

okay paul
now we final candidate for
president another one of the Metzier
clan sophomore tammy Metzier

people
people i

who care about this stupid election

we all know it do not matter who get
elected president of millard
you think
it be going to change anything around
here make one single person happy or
smart or nice
the only person it
matter to be the one who get elected
the same pathetic charade happen every
year and everyone make the same
pathetic promise just so they can put
it on they transcript to get into
college
so vote for i because i
do not even want to go to college and i
do not care and as president i will not do
anything
the only promise i make be
that if elected i will immediately
dismantle the student government so
that none of we will ever have to sit
through one of these stupid assembly
again

tammy

government about

she

special poem i wanted to read to she
later at the motel as she lay next to
i

mr
mcallister to the principal
office
mr
mcallister to the
principal office

it be not fair
it be not fair

i just do not think anybody would do
something like that on purpose
it must
have be some kind of mistake
like a
maintenance thing

jim where the hell have you be

nowhere
i do not have class until
second period

even tried you at home
we have get a
situation here

if paul lose tomorrow it be not fair
there have to be another election with

do not you see

somebody tear down they poster

those poster cost a lot of money we
do not have i there be no time to make
any more poster there be no

we will get to the bottom of it

we still have some extra one do not
we
maybe we can just

it be tammy i that be who it be

oh no hey
like i said
tammy
would not
she

well that speech she give it be
pretty you know pretty out there
but
we will get to the bottom of it
do not
you worry
mr
mcallister be going to
see to that
right jim

he thought
elsewhere
oh yeah you bet

she should be expel
or bad

you two just go back and focus on you
study
mr
mcallisters going to
handle this


tracy

when i arrive at school that morning
i be shock to find that one of i key
banner have be remove by vandal
i
notice that a few of i rival poster
have also be tamper with
of course
i be outraged but one day before the
election be not the time to lose you
head over a couple of poster
when
you be in the public eye attack like
that just come with the territory

tracy
come on in
and shut the door
behind you

i guess you know why you be here

if it be about the poster i think it be
so awful
it be a travesty

travesty
huh
that be interesting
because i think you do it

wait be you accusing i
you be not
serious
i can not
mr
mcallister we have
work together on for three solid
year and
i mean i can not believe it
i be
i be shock

mr

i be running on i
qualification
i would never need to
resort to you know to vandalism like
a you know
plus i own good banner
be torn down
do i do that too

be you or be you not working in the
watchdog office over the weekend

i be
so
mr
Pecharda let i in
as you know with all i
responsibility i often come in on the
weekend and have permission to do so
but i left very early around




how do you know what time the
poster be torn down

i do not
i just know they be there
when i left
i be giving you helpful
information be all
you know instead
of wasting time interrogate i we
should be out there trying to find out
who do this

okay tracy so who do you think do
it
whom should we interrogate


well i do not know
it could have be
anybody
there be a lot of you know
subversive element around millard
you
know like rick Thieson and kevin speck
and those burnouts
or doug Schenken
what about he
or what about tammy
Metzier
she whole thing be be anti
this and antithat

you be a very intelligent girl tracy
you have many admirable quality
but
someday maybe you will learn that being
smart and always be on top and do
whatever you need to do to get ahead
and yes step on people to get
there well there be a lot more to life
than that
and in the end you be only
cheating yourself

why be you lecturing i

this be not the time or the place to get
into it but there be for just one
example a certain former colleague of
mine who make a very big mistake a
life mistake
i think the lesson there
be that old and young we ail make
mistake and we have to learn that we
action all of they can carry serious
consequence
you be very young tracy
underage in fact but maybe one
day you will understand

i do not know what you be refer to
but i do know that if certain old and
wise people have not act like such
little baby and get all mushy
everything would be okay

i agree
but i also think certain
young and naive people need to thank
they lucky star and be very very
grateful the whole school do not find
out about certain indiscretion which
could have ruined they reputation and
chance to win certain election

and i think certain old person like
you and you colleague should not be
leach after they student
especially when some of they can not even
get they own wife pregnant
and they
certainly should not be running around
making slanderous accusation
especially when certain young naive
people mother be paralegal
secretary at the city big law
firm and have win many successful
lawsuit
and if you want to keep
questioning i like this i will not
continue without i attorney present

okay tracy
have it you way

you wanted to see i mr


just wait outside
tammy

okay
but be this about the poster

possibly
please just wait outside

okay
because i know who do it
so
i will
just be outside

tracy do not go away
come in tammy

this ought to be good

so
what do you have to tell i

well this be hard for i but i think
it be important to be honest
do not you

what be it
tammy

i be the one
i do it
i tear down
pauls poster

look at she skeptically do not say a
word

i do it

and when do you do it

this weekend

exactly when

i do not know
yesterday
sunday

and how do you get in the school

door be open

which door

i do not know
all i know be i do it i

i do not believe you

i have proof

you do not know what it be like to grow
up in the shadow of an old brother
like paul
it be always paul paul
paul paul
never tammy
i be only
pauls little sister
you must be
and i be so trouble
i hate he
i
hate he
and i tear down he poster
it be a horrible cowardly act but i
do it
i do it
l do it
and
i be not sorry

final i do not know what you problem
be but if that be the way you want it
that be the way it will be
i do not have
time

i be turning you over to dr
hendricks

discover within myself a place of
perfect peace

of friendship and family we create each

that be no mistake

i be lonely
you take advantage

i
i take advantage of you
you
hug i
you kiss i
you be the
one who

hey mr

big day huh

what you get

i be not suppose to tell
not until
you have count too
we be each suppose
to make an independent count

you be kidding right

i think those be the rule mr
mcallister
if they have changed in any
way

larry we be not elect the fuck
pope here
just tell i who win

it be a squeaker mr

i have get tracy
by a vote
just one vote

mr


huh
okay
well i guess i would well
do i count

sputnik


right
and what year be that




almost

so the point here be
when we find out about sputnik we get
really scare
it seem like no matter
what we have and keep secret they could
develop it too
Abombs hbombs
rocket ship
and this time we be
behind they
so february
kennedy tell congress and the american
people he want to go to the moon
may
the apollo program be announced

you know that moment when they announce
the winner of a beauty pageant
when
miss texas or whoever suddenly realize
she be miss america and all she can do
be scream and weep and hug the loser
i have i moment in the hallway that
tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but
myself

i be at the end of i count when it
happen
i would come up with exactly the
same number as larry
tracy have win
the election by a single vote to

i be about to announce i tally
when

the sight of tracy at that moment
affected i in a way i can not fully
explain
part of it be that she be
spy but mostly it be she face
look at she you might think she be
a sweet innocent teenage girl
but she
be not sweet
and she be not innocent
she be selfish and cynical and
ambitious and think nothing of
destroy the live of other to get to
the top
who know how high she would
climb in life how many people would
suffer because of she
i have to stop she
now

larry

yeah

i think we have get a problem




i get the same as
you jim
look like pauls we
president

no way i it do not make sense

sorry
i figure work out exactly the
same as jims
for paul for
tracy

and disregard right

if you say so

mostly tammy fan

see it do not add up
there be only
ballot but people vote
two
vote be miss
check the register

he be right
two people must have
pockete they ballot
usually it be
more

but they be there i count
vote

it happen larry
people make
mistake

i do not make a mistake
every vote be
there when you sac down

whoa
easy Fouch
i do not like where
you be going

i be telling you
dr
hendricks every
vote be account for

larry
we have get twentyfive minute
until the assembly and we still have to
do count for treasurer and
secretary
mr
hendricks and i have both
verify the number and unless you can
come up with the ballot you claim be
miss

but mr



Fouch that be enough
end of story

paul i just want you to know that no
matter how this turn out you have run a
wonderful campaign
it be be fun
competing with you

yeah you too tracy
i be just glad
it be over

yeah

you know i do not understand why
everybody badmouthed tracy all the
time
she be always super nice to i

if we could get start
people
once
the winner be announced we can all go
home okay

some contest be so well fight that
be seem unfair for someone to win and
someone to lose
i think that be the
case with all the candidate you see
before you today
all of they be
highly qualify and embody the uh the
integrity we expect from we school
leadership

act surprise
walk slowly to the
podium
be modest
thank they for this
incredible honor

that said the whole point of an
election be to choose winner and that
you have do
we will begin with
president

let i add that this be an
extraordinarily close race
it be i
pleasure to announce the next president
of millard high school

muscular
dystrophy

and on halloween we could have a
haunt house
but a really good
haunt house not like those cheesy bad
one
you know more like the radio
station one
this one would be really
scary
and for homecoming well you

time to get into all this later

whole year in fact
right now i just
need to finish i pie and get home

oh okay

through that night but we do
we
marriage have go right to the brink
but in the end i guess it be saved by
one simple fact

the painful process of piece we live
back together
the bad be over
the
mistake of the past be behind we

the next day held the promise of a new
begin
after all what harm have
really be do

i do not know why but finding out there
be a mistake and i have not win the
election after all do not bother i that
much

hard to tell you

quietly it be all over for
mcallister at millard high twelve
year of hard work down the drain

walt will be speaking with you about
this but i need you to find someone to
take over i class

right drawer

okay jim
i understand

thanks
well
i be going home now

i do not remember driving home or much
of anything that happen in the next
few day

there be news story in the paper
and on television former student
calling with they support endless
hour of do nothing think
nothing

diane stand by i through the entire
humiliating ordeal in a way it sort of
even thing out between we

soon school be over and summer
stretched out in front of i as it
always have
funny how the rhythm of the
school year remains ingrain in you for
life
in midJune we find out diane be
pregnant

senior year be great i sure i do not
get to play ball or be president but i
get elected homecoming king and prom
king anyway
i get into nebraska like i
wanted and earlyrushed phi Delts
at
the end of the year i and i buddy
threw a hitching mexican party down at
the cement plant
shit that be a good
party
that be a good party

the only really bad thing about senior
year be lisa
right before christmas
she dump i
one minute she be totally
in love with i and then boom she be
going out with i football buddy randy

sometimes i wonder what would have
happen if i would actually win the
election
maybe i whole life would be
different
like i might never have go
to yosemite with greg and travis

or maybe i would be dead

catholic school be great

i mean the teacher kind of suck
and they be supposedly way more
strict but you could get away with
murder

the good thing about sacred heart be
meet jennifer

all those feeling i have for lisa be
just preparing i for the real thing
jennifer and i be soul mate and we be
never ever ever going to be apart

senior year be very productive for i
and full of personal achievement

order
order
order i can we vote on
this
those in favor

on top of a very successful student
council year i get into cornell like i
wanted with scholarship and i be in
the top th percentile of i graduate
class

but sometimes i get lonely and i would
think about dave
i missed we talk
maybe it could have work out between

maybe he
finally finished he novel

when the yearbook come out i be on

next year i be going to make all new
friend
smart more ambitious
friend
it be time to move on
there

have one more thing to take care of

after two month of sitting on i ass
and two month helping out at i
brotherinlaws travel agency

i landed a position at a saturn
dealership

i never think i would end up selling
car but it be not so bad
i like the
saturn philosophy it really be a
different kind of company

i be just relieve to have a steady
income now that there be three of we

actually it be not so difficult make
the transition from teach to selling
it be like i tell i customer
i role
be just to educate people so they can
make inform decision

when i send someone home with a new
unit i feel a genuine sense of pride

so that be about it
maybe i will get
back to teach someday but for the
time be i guess i be pretty happy
where i be at
