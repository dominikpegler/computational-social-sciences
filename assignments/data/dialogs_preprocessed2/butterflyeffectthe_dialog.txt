condition he dog to lick he nut

typical psych major
complete wise
ass
and how be you project coming
still planning to change the way we
humble scientist view memory
assimilation

hey i get no choice

whoa
smell like patchouli and
ass

cricket meet i wellmannered
roommate evan

yeah you be the one who fuck up
the bellcurve on i anthropology
final
later thumper

nice to meet you too

here bro
find you Tshirt

get dress thumper you be taking
i out for i birthday

i think you be a december baby

this be big
seven year to the
day
no blackout

let we do this

so
which one of you have a pet
worm

worm plural

that be so gross

talk to he about it he be get the
fetish

actually they be for a psych project
study on memory

shit well explain before all the
excitement give i a heart attack

it be an experiment with flatworm
and a maze
you take a flatworm and
run it through the maze until he be
memorize it
then you put a new
flatworm in the maze
he be clueless
bang into wall get lose
whatever

like ozzy

ten buck say he eat it off the
floor

you chop up the smart flatworm and
feed it to the dumb one and presto
the dumb one suddenly know the maze
inside and out

just by absorb the first worm
into it cellular structure it get
all of the worm memory

that be probably why hannibal Lecters
so smart

so what be the point

maybe if i can figure out how the
memory of a simple worm function
it will help i understand the
complexity of the human brain

so be you planning on becoming a
doctor or something

mind

such a brain and all i just wonder
if he be ever able to remember stuff
he would forgotten

when he be around you age
almost
exactly you age
he said he figure
out a trick to remember the past

i could not tell if they be real
memory or just phantom
you know
he might only have think he actually
remembered they

and then just before it get so bad
that he have to be committed he said
that he could

what
what could he do

forget it
it be nothing
he be far
too sick by then
