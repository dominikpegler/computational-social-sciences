noise
what the hell do you do

the Feeb gig be i front a coupla
undercover Russianspeakers to
they
one
and broker the
deal
set up the meet with the
type

so i give they up man

the feds

sonny i get to go


hello sonny

i get to i get to go

alonzo

what

alonzo you do not need to go home

they said they would not hurt they
would not hurt they if

they lie

they be known to do that

yeah



what be you twenty

quarter mile away
we see the
light



turn around

we know these people

grieve elsewhere


we be not certain

you said nazi Lowriders

we be not certain

mon man

we think
we do not know
alonzo only front as a broker for
we guy to make the meet
he
be not deep into the crew

white gang
it do not track

white gang be tweakers and a
crystal meth lab in a trailer park
bounce around the old lady saturday
night and get you recidivist ass
busted back

not anymore
this be a distribution
network out of south florida
moving polydrug load crystal
meth through coke to nashville
atlanta memphis cleveland
and
computer fraud identity theft
it be like that

tell they what you want

they know about alonzo before he
make a move on they
they have we
operation
they have cut into we

how

we do not know

break you encryption
hack you e
mail
employee database
somebody on the inside

we do not know
and that be the
point
maybe there be a mole
whatever it be a disaster
and
it be a joint interagency task
force
i have you

custom component in on it
so
the penetration could be from any
one agency
what we do know be i
have to suspend operation right
now from undercover work through
interdiction because i have to
assume we operational security be
blown

as in you ass be dead in the
water

but miami be not part of the

i

and from what alonzo said
he do not give you up

so what do you want

to recruit you

i do not want you around the
crime scene because it be crawling
with federal law enforcement
we
do not know who be straight up who be
not

recruit we to do what

get into business with this crew
identify they
illuminate they
network
if you be lucky discover
they source how they penetrate
we
we will indict and take it from
there

how do we do that
make a buy
that go well

reverse undercover
supply to
they

they get a steady stream of supply
so no

from whom

colombian producer
name
archangel de jesus MontoyaLondono

never hear of he

from the north valle area
new
Lowlevel we think

aryan brother be not going to
changeup supplier
so

Transpo
how they bringing the
load in

they be not
they collect in
miami
montoya the producer
handle delivery
that be his
end and he vary the route
we
get some off an of a
coupla gofast boat on one run
that be all

track with i here
they know the russian be
undercover Feeb
they should have
noshowed
but no these guy
show anyway and commit murder upon
federal officer
and steal all
you money
beat
to Fujima
what do that say to you

it say we do not fear you

it say fuck off and die
it
say we get down for
recreation


blow that up

so

we could try to run load into
these guy
run a few load for montoya into
south florida
into this group

you need to consider a few issue

you would be operating outside
territorial united states
you
badge do not count
you have no
authorization to carry weapon
if
you be bust it could take a long
time to get you repatriated
and
there be no backup
and you will share with they all
you intel on montoya

sure

i mean full disclosure

of course
from i side i do not
to know anything about what
you be do or how you do it
so let i know if we be on

about the stevens family i be
sorry
i know you be close to
they

i be the kid godfather

and

and what

i get to know
there be never any
room for personal

he be fine
and we know the joke
when it get vengeful thing get
messy
when they get messy the
wrong people die
everybody get it

good

and the answer be yes

before she meet alonzo once upon a
time a long time ago
you bet it be personal

okay
Whatd you spot

three wake off the back of those
boat
who run three sterling
engine off a deepV hull

sal Maguda

he any good

change off sal Maguda running he
delivery

that be jose Yero
splattered all over his
motherfucking wall


so we can close each other eye
right now
real easy
real fast
but then nobody make any
money

equipment

slow and low adam s
carbon composite stealthy
nauticalmile range thousand ki
payload
all the way to Caravels
and s from a source country to

he send i to university for an
in finance
you mother

die in childbirth have i

to mother
and all that we owe
they

you know how improbable this be

probable
apply to an event
that may be real
do not apply
here

because we have no future
be
of today and not tomorrow

that be right

and therafore there be no
consequence

exactly



let we talk delivery

and a different kind of deal

like

like three thousand a ki
that be
nice
and i can supply the transportation
into south florida and the gulf
more reliable and ontime than
FedEx
but three per ki be
for opener

and why should continue
excellence cost more

cost less
that be the point

be it december

what do you mean

do christmas come early this
year

well than that
we become partner
only in this
territory and only on load we run
and you do not pay we three thousand
a ki
you pay we zero
why we
get be thirty percent of the load
product or cash
and why you be
think would i be crazy enough
to out in these gringo like that
be he chipping
crazy for i love
too many mojitas
and the answer
be of course but also no
it
be because sonny can deliver what
no one else can


good samba dance

zero risk

because you do not lose load

because we guarantee every load
anywhere for any reason it come
up short we make good
you
operation will from now on run
riskfree

and you be we thirtypercent
partner

what if i tell you that you idea
be too big for you skin
that merely to propose this be a
dangerous thing

then i would say to you this have
be fun

the range should be between fifteen
and seventeenpointfive percent of
the


to even consider it

i need thirty
calculate in also
the cash you do not have to front

available cash be not an issue for
we

Twentyeightpointfive

what if i push to twentyone

i would say you be
hesitate
hold up four
finger
four percentage point away from
a deal

maybe i be only one

we will do it at twentytwo

and now what

and now i make you breakfast

Megatonnage and megacash flow

out of

haiti and puerto rico

through dubai and geneva maybe

they load be polydrug

precursor from jordan afghan

Midocean transshipments
he real
business be
he be a network

and we can illuminate part of it
from the inside out

so we want to changeup the mission
statement

we be the one do the death

local importer get a pass for the
time being

i do not know

week for a Feeb bureaucratic
process

in there they risk exposure
so

what be it going to be

okay

you fuckin well be right


what be going on

as in

there be undercover
and there
be which way be up


you think i be in so deep i forget

i be asking
you to i

do you believe
i have forgotten i
be a cop

i would never doubt you

and do you doubt i will slot anyone
complicit in the death of maria
alonzo and those child
anyone
whoever they be

no i do not



and day future with
short canadian and dollar


and we be looking at nigerian
crude

precursor shipment from ras tanura
and Juaymah

Transshipped to a malaysian
container ship

not french registry

they have be target
and
pakistani registry be too
vulnerable to search and seizure
right now

jose do not like the deal in south
florida

burnett
they want of the value on load
they run into south florida
it be
the juarez cartel model
they guarantee the load
the
upside be we risk go to zero
that freesup capital

but what do you intuition tell
you

i intuition
i intuition
make he breakfast the other
morning in havana

and

they be serious
they be cautious
they will forgo a deal over a
technicality of how a delivery
handle
they would walk away rather
than compromise operational
security
that be good

but they have to be watch
closely

why

good deal like this with we for
burnett will be good only
temporarily
he will get restless
because he believe nothing be
forever
life be dust make it
while you can
he be ambitious

so i predict a few good run
then
there be a renegotiation

that be i girl

on the next load jose want to
front they silver
but they they in
lead
he think they be wrong
what do
you think

i think jose suspect anybody he
do not intimidate
and people
who be good at what they do
they
have ego too

what would you do

i like the diminished risk
it
free up capital reserve
i like
working with selfinterested
businessman who be competent
you
can predict they behavior

on the other hand
if what you
wish mi corazon be la
plumba
the lead
then let we do
that
accept they deal
after
the load be received
we will
close they eye forever

let we try a few run with these
partner i think
i will tell
jose

what

in the s air route come into
favor
it required many pilot
the good be american
former
cropdusters
they do not fly by
the book
tell one
put that
down on this fifteenhundredfoot
runway
somehow he would do it
great pilot
but pablo have a
rule
after they fly six
load
this good pilot who
facilitate so much good
business
he would come back to
medellin or barranquilla to pick up
the next load
and no one would ever see he
again
he would disappear
you a good pilot
make a lot of money for pablo
thank you very much
and then
pablo would kill he ass
after
six load
and who be pablo escobar

provincial who get bustedout by
the white collar from cali
when
the gringo get he he be nobody
we be three time good than pablo
escobar

to fall back on
you know a
failsafe
insurance

or Allstate

because whatever can go wrong

something like that
the odds
catch up with you
the odds be
like gravity
you can not negotiate
with they
so
at some point you should cash
