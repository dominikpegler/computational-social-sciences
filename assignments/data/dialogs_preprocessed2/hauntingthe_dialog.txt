it be still an electric shock

come on malcolm it be only seven
ohm it be nothing it be like a
joy buzzer
and it be not about
the pain it be about the
interference with concentration

look look at what it do
the
subject on the left because they
anticipate the shock make the
adjustment and lose nothing on
they score
the subject on the
right because the shock be
random can not anticipate and the
distraction throw they off

stop defending you science after
the fact jim
the department
protocol for research be very
clear about this and you violate
the rule
i know i know i know
that fear and performance be a
big sexy idea but as long as i be
chairman here you will need this
department endorsement to
publish it and right now i can not
do that

late s marrow pretty



malcolm this be essential work
i be do
just think what i
research can do for education
elementary school classroom near
train track or airport where
loud noise be random
this help
to prove the need for sound
insulation if the child be
ever going to learn to read

and that will be a good place to
end this study

no malcolm
individual
performance be only part of it
i
know why baseball player choke
for no reason i know why
violinist throw up with fear
before every concert and need to
to give a great performance but
what i want to know be how fear
work in a group

not the way you have constructed
you group it be just not ethical

but if the group know it be be
studied as a group you
contaminate the result
the
deception be minor

be you working with she

mary i will meet you outside

why be you working with she
mary lambretta be throw out of
the department for trying to get a
ph

every
year be a good year

theo
it be you turn

the rest of you may hate you
insomnia but i find it the good
time of the day for i
i be
alone
Nobodys talking to i but
myself
i mind be racing with
idea and i can think

nah you be going crazy with
doubt all of you mistake be
coming back up the pipe and it be
badly than a nightmare


excuse i

do not give i that look it be
everybody problem we just have
different variation i for
example
i fall asleep easily
but i wake up around two or three
in the morning every morning
it be that time of night that
fitzgerald called the deep dark
night of the soul
i stare
into
the abyss
every night
break he own
somber mood
it be the price i pay for be
such a jolly fellow
ust

i think i would fall asleep easily
but just as i start to feel
comfortable i see thing in the
dark

i feel the presence of something
watch i
it be not
scary
not by itself but
i do not want
to go to sleep because i be worry
about the thing attack i
so
when i finally do fall asleep i be
like a soldier who be fallen asleep
at she post
i feel like i have
betrayed myself
nell

all of you have such interesting
problem

no
please i know how that
sound but
you be all so
articulate
you know how to talk
i feel like i be here under false
pretenses
it be silly it be not
like
well all of you have
trouble sleep because you live
in the world and the world be
complicate and scary but
nothing ever happen to i
so
i do not have a reason to sleep
badly

you write that you have trouble
sleep

yes because someone be always
keeping i awake
ever since i
be little
that be i job
i
take care of i mother and i have
to be there for she all night
long and she wake up all the
time
and after she die well
it be be a few month but i
still i still wake up it be
a
habit
i know we have only known each other
a couple of hour but i be really
glad to be with people who let i
talk about this
i be really happy
to be here with you

we be glad you be here

why do not we move to another room

it be an erard
late s

what be wrong

the harp be out of tune

i will have to count david watts as
a noshow
so let we start
thank
you mary

all right
so to answer you
early question todd why be we
here
what do we all need in
life what be the basic
we
need food we need water we need
sleep
sleep
all of you resist
it
why
what do that mean
why do we resist sleep
i field
of study be the individual
psychology of emotion and
performance

so why do you need the addams
family mansion for a scientific
test

i think it good to be isolated
to be in a location with a
definite sense of history and i
wanted to make sure that it be not
so pleasant you would all sleep too
easily
you will be taking a
variety of test none of they
harmful and you have get the house
the ground and each other to
keep you company

when do we take the test

every day
basically we will be
hanging out together like we have
so far this evening

also there be no phone service to
the house and no
i have the
cell phone for emergency
we will
begin the test after breakfast
tomorrow

dr
marrow what be this house

there be once a king who build a
palace
the kings name be hugh
crain
hundred and thirty year
ago when the merrimack valley be
the center of american industry
hugh crain make two hundred
million dollar
that be forty
three billion dollar in today
money
he could have anything he
wanted
and what he wanted be
rene he banker beautiful
daughter
rene and a house
filled with child

all the carving

but there be a sad catch to the
story

what happen

there be no child
rene
die and
then
hugh crain build
all of this and then he die
he heart be broken

that be so sad

i think there be more to the story
this house have it own music
doctor marrow i can play it for
you i can hear it

i eye
oh
i eye
i
eye
oh
no

oh jesus

mary let i see you eye

here cover it
do not let she
touch it

keep you head back that be it

here i key to the gate
call
i the second you know anything

that could have be bad

yeah

luke can i talk to you

sure

because
well i know i can
trust you

why

i have read you test

there be something
i
i do not
tell you everyth ng about the
house and about hugh crain
but
i be asking you not to repeat it

i can keep a secret

he said that hugh crain
hugh
crain be a monster
he said that
he be a brutal horrible man
he
told i that crain drive he
worker to early death
crain
have child chained to the loom
in he mill
and listen to this
he beautiful rene killed herself

and why do not marrow tell
we
do not he trust woman
that
fuck

she be think
about the story
not marrow
monster
but he build this for
the woman he loved like the taj
mahal

the taj mahal be not a palace it
be a tomb
why do not he tell
we

he be trying to protect the
experiment
personally i do not
think he be get a large enough
sample for valid result but as
long as the money good and the
food be good i be in

nell it be an accident

icebreaker exercise conduct over
dinner
observe initial bond
among subject and experimenter
after dinner first bland history
of house relay
nell appear
most susceptible to suggestive
history
luke who test at the
bottom of the LevyMogel
confidence reliability scale be
given the second part of the
story
we should see some result
tomorrow
accident with harp
while unfortunate
complement
the experimental fiction

publish or perish

ever try putting you hair up in a
french twist

fear affect individual
performance
mass hysteria be
like a story nell
communal
story
