scout master log
september second
first day of search party for sam
Shakusky
morale be extremely low in
part i suppose because sam be
unfortunately the least popular scout in
the troop by a significant margin
i be
worry and i be confuse
please let we
find he tomorrow
please do not let he
fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
lake or something
terrible day at camp
ivanhoe
let we hope tomorrow good
in
fact i be going to say a prayer






perform by the
chorister of st
jack wood and new penzance


one year early




what kind of bird be you

i be a raven


boy be not allow in here

where do you come from
go
back to you seat

he like you

be you follow


i doubt it

good

do you bring a cat

can you read a map

Uhhuh

i do cartography

i feel we should go halfway today and
halfway tomorrow since you be a less
experience hiker and you be wearing
Sundayschool shoe



here where we be right now
i would like
to pitch camp here by sixteenhundred
how do that
sound

fine

you want some beef jerky




let we go


be you thirsty

no

well if you throat get parched stick
a pebble in you mouth and suck on it
you can quench you thirst with the spit
supposedly

sometimes i stick leave under i hat
it
cool you head down

that be a good idea
it might help also if
you do not wear fur

true but this add camouflage

here a trick
throw grass in the air
and you can see which direction the
windas blowing

which way

unknown
i guess it do not really
matter as long as we cover we track


these might be poisonous

no they be huckleberries in fact
try
one

not bad
anyway they be good for
survival

he know someone watch he

i agree
why do you say that

i do not know
i just think he can feel
we

you smell like perfume

it be i mother

i bring water too


should we catch he

what for

trout bait
we need worm

no

you be right
we will let he live
maybe
i have get a licorice whip

how strong of a swimmer be you

pretty good
i broke we school record
for the backstroke


well i be not that strong of a
swimmer so i wear a lifepreserver
i
think it be a good policy to get in the
habit anyway






watch out for turtle
they will bite you
if you put you finger in they mouth
let i see if i can catch this one

somebody write on he

the stick moving

you get one

fish on hook
reel he in
slowly

sit down


you be do good

this be for fish

as some of you know i taught sam for the
cartography accomplishment patch
he be a
smart boy and he expressed a keen
interest in the history of the island
indigenous people
in particular i
recall he fascination with the idea of
retrace the original path of the old
Chickchaw harvest migration

what i be get at be this
i think i
know where they be going






onto the birdhouse where every kind of
bird imaginable be whirl and wheel
around
this be a real acrobatic act for
we gift young flute player paula
robeson


this be weird

i know

on three


i like it here but i do not like the
name

up by an atom bomb

captain sharp

what be going to happen to he

well normally we would try to place he in
another foster home but that option be
no longer available to we in i opinion
with he case history which mean
he will go to juvenile refuge

what be that
an orphanage


who be speaking

this be scout master ward

right
an orphanage but the first step
be the admission panel require a
psychological evaluation to determine
whether or not the boyo a candidate for
institutional treatment or electroshock
therapy
beyond that

excuse i
shock therapy
why would that
be necessary
he be not violent

the report describe an assault with
scissors

that be the girl
who do that

well maybe she need help too but
that be not we job






i will be out back


i be going to find a tree to chop down


i do know what you be feeling Suzybean
i have have moment myself where i say
what
be i do here
who make this decision
how could i allow myself to do something
so stupid
and why be it still happening
we
woman be more emotional
you have to


i hate you


do not say hate

why not
i mean it


you think you mean it
in this moment
you be trying to hurt i


exactly
i know what you do with that sad dumb
police man
you go to bed with he


he be not dumb but i guess he be kind of
sad
anyway we should not discuss that
it be not appropriate for i to even
acknowledge what i already just say


poor suzy
why be everything so hard for
you


we be in love
we just want to be
together
what be wrong with that

fishhook out

i admit we know we would get in trouble
that
parte true
we know people would be
worry and we still run away anyway
but something also happen which we
do not do on purpose
when we first meet
each other
something happen to we



i agree with you
that be eloquent
i
can not argue against anything you be
saying but i do not have to because
you be twelve year old

look let we face it you be probably a
much more intelligent person than i be
in fact i guarantee it but even smart
kid sometimes stick they finger in
electrical socket if you see what i
mean
it take time to figure thing out
it be be proven by history
all mankind

protect you from the dangerous one
if
we can

you want a slug
