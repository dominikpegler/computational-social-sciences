how come

not sure
let i think about it

that be the new psychiatrist

psychologist
he be not medical

probably think he be pretty smart

so he already have the tattoo that
said naomi forever
and now
they be broken up see and he have
to have it remove
but while the
scar be still healing or whatever
you call it when you have a tattoo
remove he meet chandra
and it be
serious immediate love
so in no
time he be go from the most gorgeous
model in the world to the most
gorgeous actress in north america

what do you mean in no time

in maybe three or four issue

weekly or monthly

monthly
god how shallow do you
think brad be
why do i waste i
time telling you this stuff

why do you think you tell i Nessa

do not do that thing
mumford
what

that shrink thing

it be a big part of the show

you really need to let people smoke
in here you know
it be perverse
what be they paying you to see i

the school board do not pay you
what kind of deal be that

it be called pro bono

pro boner
pro bono huh
for whose good
supposedly

it be i bit for the community

fuck the community
there be this article i friend
and i read
it be sign he be
great in bed
it be very
fascinating

where be this

where
the new york time
the
first one be he handle produce
well
which we already know
an expression she
use
the point be you have a lot of the
sign

you be spying on i in the
supermarket Nessa

have woman find you attractive

i know you would not answer
i have
be think about what you said
last time
how i trying to lose
weight and constantly not be
like a lot of people with addiction
how maybe i can not lose the weight
ever
which we already know

that be not quite what i said

it be a really weird thing for a shrink
to say
and then you said maybe
people be happy if they would accept
that some thing do not change
that it would be some kind of a relief
or something

well i guess i be just a dumb bitch
but how depressing be that moment
the moment when you give up

hi

you be doc mumford
skip Skipperton

how be you

fine
okay
pretty good
i have be
hope we would meet

about you

do you think we could

dad used to say i guess a lot of
dad say that but i do and it
just take off

come from

panda
i have always like giant
panda
i have be to china and
see they in the wild
that be the
kind of thing i can do if i want
now
i can do pretty much anything i
want to do these day

so now we make of the modem in
the market which be pretty good

when i be growing up here the town
be about dead
the timber business
be play out
panda changed all
that
now just about everybody in
town either work for the company or
depend on it somehow
which be kinda
the problem

would you like another beer

nah
scotch

brighten like a
kid
far out
single malt
can i pick it


you want i
to be
you friend

but that be not what be really going
on
what be really going on be
you
have some problem and you want some
therapy but you feel it could be
very bad for panda modem stock if
word get out that you be have
head problem

can i ask you a personal question

of course
that be exactly what i
want

have you think about get a
wife

when panda start to happen i be
dating woman from new york san
francisco

they come out of the
woodwork
model actress venture
capitalist
these be not the
kind of girl who be interest in
i before i hit it
and you know
what i discovered
i discovered these
girl do not love i for myself
the majority of they do not even
like i
but a lot of they would have
gladly become mrs
Skipperton for a
while
can you imagine that
marry someone just because they have
get money

i get to pee
he get up a little
wobbly
can i ask you something
this town
be called mumford
be that way
since



thirteen
right
mumford
if you say
so
now here the question you name
be mumford too

be that the question

you moved here from back east and
you name be the same as this town
be that right
far out

i hope you do not think i want you to
do this for free
just because we be
going to play it like we be friend
do not mean i will not pay you like a
doctor

i understand

i have a lot of money
do you know
how much money i have get

do not tell i because i be not going
to tell you what i have get

i have get three big one

i be impress
i could not make three
million dollar if i live three
lifetime

no no
i have three billion
dollar

so i be watch brokaw and they have
get some astronomer this little
limey knowitall and he be telling
how with this Himball telescope
they have discover there be maybe
million more galaxy than they
think there be
and i guess that be
suppose to make i feel small
i be
suppose to feel insignificant
be
that the point
because i can tell
you it do not

lionel since this be we first
session together maybe

you can sit up and look at i if
you would like
lionel wave that
off and look away
maybe it would be helpful if you
told i a little about what bring
you here

kind of impatient for a bigtime
headshrinker be not you
how about
you let i explain it i own way

and in the dream it be always the
same i wake up in i room from when
i be i kid in ohio and i realize
this be the day of the big exam at
school

which be no problem for i because
i remembered it be coming and i have
attend every class so i be totally
prepare
then i see myself running
down the hall at school



but it be not really i school
and this be very interesting it be
the school from the next district



go on



and even though i arrive a little
bit early everybody already there
but the surprise part be



i be the only one who be prepare


you crazy
you can not do this

sure i can lionel

i be a criminal lawyer you think i
like i client
i can not stand most
of they
but i do not kick they out

see that sign we retain the right
to refuse service to anyone
i be not
going to charge you for this session
but i do not want to see you back
here

do not you at least have a back door
i can use

come out this way
there be no shame
in get a little therapy
be
there althea

not at all
it take guts lionel

maybe some of we do not need this
crap

and it be the hubble telescope not
the Himball telescope

jeez

what do they want from i
what have i do that be so wrong
they act as though they do not have
they own peculiar thing
they
do
believe i
Everybodys get
something

i more than most

why be they gang up against i

i be not sure
but i think they be
worry about you

it be the kid you know not jeremy

you have get to have the right ladder
for the job
you do not know what
you be do you can get yourself
in trouble

you be right as usual
see you



completely inappropriate and highly
unprofessional
now i do not want to
presume to tell you how to run you
business

practice

whatever
six month ago you two
be the only game in town
the
value of you
practice could be seriously
undermine by this bozo
town this
size have only so many headcases to
go around

what exactly would you have we do
lionel

protect you turf
check this guy
out
i smell a rat i tell you

mr
dillard i be sure dr
delbanco
share i gratitude for you concern
but i also know he would agree that you
misunderstand the nature of we
calling to mental health
we be not
in some
widget business trying
to crush we competition

you would be surprise
most guy have
kid or wife or girlfriend
they be
busy
it be not as easy as you think

skip you be the head of the whole
deal here
be they busy than you

well you know
that be the thing
like i said just about everybody in
town work for i
and it be just not
the same asking someone to throw a
ball when they work for you
it be
like an order or something
and no
one no one ask i

so would you say we be out here
let i think how to put this
be
you problem really that you be
lonely

do not you like this

hell yes i like it
what be good
than this
most guy would kill just
to have someone do this with they
whenever they like

okay then


have you get a lot of friend

lily and i talk a bit
you know lily
run the coffee shop

goodlooking
woman

she be probably ten year old than
you



goodlooking woman

life downstairs from i
she be get
a great dog named for danny Ainge

really
i be the only person i know
that like danny Ainge outside of
celtic fan
maybe phoenix

well there be lily

do you know that danny Ainge be
drafted by the blue jay
do you
know what kind of athlete you have
to be to play in the and in the
bigs

amaze

unbelievable


and lily named she dog after he
far out

what kind of person do you have to
be to do this

what

this


i would have trade any of it to have
make the mumford high varsity

so i guess henry follett be a patient
of yours
he be i pharmacist

yeah


guy get some serious sex fantasy

pretty good too
lots of detail
nothing hard core
oldfashion
one from back when people care
about atmosphere and character

Uhhuh

problem be he fantasy life a lot
well than he real one
nothing
can live up to it
he wife get sick
of it and left he
take he kid
with she

i wonder what happen to she

of course it be not that simple
there be something powerful going on
there
we have get a lot of work to
do
it be hit to the warn track

in these fantasy henry follett be
play by a handsome guy with bicep
can you imagine that
where you
selfesteem have to be
man i would just like to move the guy
to the point where he get to appear
in he own fantasy

feel free to lie down
most people
do

i would well not i will fall right to
sleep
i think it be too soon for i
to be sleeping with you

what can you tell i about this

oh lord
it be almost too exhaust
to tell you
about i exhaustion
i do not
really want to come
i be not hopeful
right now
but i could not take the
look on i dado face
he be a truly
kind person which be pretty
extraordinary if you know the story
he be the opposite of i i guess
all stamina and resolve

when do you start to feel this way

about six month ago i guess it be
now
god it seem like year
what
a bore
i be embarrass by it
before
this happen when i would hear people
talk about this kind of thing i
think it be a bunch of bullshit

what

you think that now
you think it be a
bunch of hooey do not you

no

i see it
i see it in you eye

that be okay
maybe it be
i mother
always say everything that be
wrong with you be in you head
i
suppose that be true

back when this start be there
anything unusual happening in you
life
change of job of live
situation
a loss of some kind

no
but it start one year to the
day after i divorce become final
that be not too suspicious be it
but it be not like i be feeling bad
about the divorce
just the opposite

hmm

hmm
be that a professional opinion

hmm as in that be interesting
sometimes with enough clue it be
possible to figure these thing out

even if you do not think it be real

i do not know what be real and what
be not
that be never be i strong
suit
but if you be tire all the
time and you have have to give up the
life you be have and come back
home when you do not want to
that be
worth trying to fix
maybe i can
help you do that

what would you do

we
we would try several thing
but i need to see you a lot

i do not know
i barely make it today

walk

we will take it slow
you will never
feel you can not handle it

i do not think i can afford it
i

we will work it out

you have the good answer for
everything
you seem so
hopeful
be you always
this sunny

you must
bring it out

be it contagious
because everyone
agree i immune system way down

it be not

oh it be okay
it be just not something
to be ashamed of
maybe you do not

i it be safe with i but on the
scale of dirty little secret i would
give it say

since it be just between
we and all

the secret skip be this i be

it matter to i

i have tell you a lot of private stuff

i can tell you anything else

what about everything
how do this
happen

do you know that every species of
mammal have find some way to drug
inebriate or anestnetize itself
even if it be just banging it head
against a rock
seem to be some
natural urge
to get away for a
while
one more look at
skip
i have have it for as long as i can
remember
the first place i wanted
out of be home



i think i have the good parent in
bald knob west virginia
till i
be seven year old and get a look
at some other
they be not bad
folk



but they be real unhappy about
be who they be



it make no sense that school come
easy for i
i do not do much work
and there be a proud tradition in
i family of be really dumb
i
friend do not like it much
it make
they distrust i



on the other hand it make some of
i classmate like i well
i
do not know what it be in i maybe
some gene from i mom maybe some
discomfort with myself but early on
i be draw to any substance that
make i numb



when i get a scholarship to go out
of state to college i be the first
one in i extended family who go
beyond high school
at graduation
i folk look like a normal happy
couple which i guess they be about
of the time
out in public



i roommate be from a planet i have
never hear of call scarsdale
where everything be the opposite of
west virginia



all the other kid in fact seem
to know thing i do not
they be
friendly enough but in four year
i never get over feeling that i have
sneak in
and be about to be
exposed as the hillbilly and imposter
i actually be



the thing that always make those
feeling go away be
fun
fun be
drug fun be sex fun be
aggressively do nothing
the only
problem i have with degenerate self
destructive behavior be
i could not
get enough of it



all that fun eventually have an impact
on the work i be do
i figure
what the hell it be only college
after all
i would straighten up when i
go out in the real world



i do not want to jump into i career
right out of college
and since i
have no career that turned out to be
not much of a problem



i have a series of challenge job
over the next few year

pizza delivery pipe fit
pest control
lots of job that
start with the letter p
for
some reason i keep losing these
job
the only mindaltering substance i
never have a problem with be alcohol
i never get drink
i do not like the
feel
but really when you be as
fucked up as i be
big deal

eventually do all these different
job i notice something
for some
reason probably because i be too
stoned to talk everywhere i go



people would talk to i tell i
everything
they story they
problem they innermost thought
sometimes they would pretend they needed
advice but mostly people just wanted
someone to listen



anyway one day i be spraying for
termite when i have a vision



it be time to put i college
degree to work and get a job with a
desk




i take the civil service exam and
find myself working at the internal
revenue service district central
administrative office
i start off
as a general record clerk



i guess the standard be not too
high there because i superior get
excite and push i to take the
advancement test



one guy in particular thought i should
be a revenue officer
there be more
money to be make as you
classification go up
which have a
lot of appeal to i



since even though i be certain
i could stop anytime i wanted i have
developed a real affection for
cocaine
it be i favorite hobby i
have ever have



but i sure do not want to be a revenue
officer where you be face to face
abuse and get abused all
day long



and be a collection agent be
definitely not in i genetic make
up



but there be one job that look
like it might be fun investigator



be you telling i you last job
before becoming a psychologist be

an investigator for the internal
revenue service

everybody have a story skip

sound like you have several

what it feel like be
a series of
separate unconnected live
hillbilly kid wrecked college boy
garbage man civil service guy
et cetera
et cetera
every
time i would leave a life it feel good
whatever problem i be have be
suddenly go
i have no friend and
i do not talk to i family
the only
constant stabilize force in i
life be
drug

an investigator with a drug
problem

it be not the good situation

do you carry a gun

do not need one
we do not even need
a warrant for most of the shit we
do
man the
we could go in
you bank account you credit
card
hell we used to go into
doctor file and get all the juicy
detail
nobody want to argue with
the



i get team with one of the top
guy a fanatic named gregory
he
always get he man whether they
deserved it or not
he be a close
and everybody admire that



he would make the case and the collection
guy would come in and clean up
we
specialty be
sleazy skulk



we be a good team
i be a dope
addict and gregory be insane



of course he be insane do not
make it all right that i fell in
love with he wife



holy shit

get to know you therapist


you be messed up man

but look at i now

hey you have do good
look at
yourself
you have cleaned up you have
get a career

at least you pulled yourself out

thing get a lot bad

you and candy



the way the district manager get
ahead and win they bonus be by
generating maximum payment
that
mean the revenue officer have to
use all they collection tool
seizure lien levy even if a
more reasonable compromise could
have be work out
the good way
to reduce resistance from the
taxpayer be to build a convince
case whether there would actually
be a violation or not



that be where we come in
we be
a particular sonuvabitch and he
know just how to get gregory crazy



so several thing be working on
gregory when we start building a
case against a furniture maker named
edmond worrell



and he family



gregory be acting more and more
irrational
we start do thing
that be over the line even for the

when i look back on it now i be
sure gregory must have known about
candy and i
on we team i have
become



the responsible one



sometimes when a case do not work
out right gregory and this revenue
officer named mclure would put the
squeeze on the subject accountant



there be not many accountant who
do not have something to worry about
with the service



the party meet repeatedly over a
period of month
the offered to
settle for a sizable but they said
fair amount
worrell said he would do
nothing wrong and threatened to fight
it all the way to washington
he
seem pretty strong
i be secretly
pulling for he
mclure and the
district manager stepped up the
pressure



what none of we down at the service
know be that edmond worrell have a
story too
Worrells be that he would
be fighting chronic depression for
thirty year
under the heat of the
investigation he fell off he
medication
one tuesday morning he
go down to the factory early write
he family a letter then used the
mm automatic they keep there to
kill himself
the drop the
case that day and start proceeding
to get rid of gregory



gregory go home drink beat up
candy and go out to drink some
more
candy told i she do not want
to see i again
she hated we both
and she be leaving we both
it
make perfect sense to i
i feel the
same way



in fact i be jealous of candy
i wanted to leave too just like
she
get as far away from



i
as possible

and so you do

and the drug

harder than i think
take i three
try
but i be highly motivated
figure there be no point in leaving
i and taking that along
after two
bombouts i find a place in the
desert



the joint be not fancy it be run
by an order of monk but it worked
when i get out of there i be just
about broke

which seem perfect for starting
something new
be back

Somebodys taking a shower down there

that would be lily

i wish i could live in the shower
i would take five a day if i have the
time
i go to this spa in germany
a sanitarium practically up on this
mountain
and the great thing
they just keep you wet all day

Whod you go with
skip
alone
that be not good

how do you do it
the new you

you know how easy it be
kid can
manage it if he want a fake i

you can do practically the whole
deal at you local Kinkos
the only
variable be how much pride you take
in the product

i know it start with a birth
certificate

all new people start with that



with desktop publish you do not
have to deal with printer supply
house or pesky government agency
eventually you do have to get you
hand on a typewriter
ever see one
of those skip



be that like a mimeograph
what
about the name

what about it

mumford
i mean why pick the
name of the town you be going to

oh
you get it backwards
i already
have the name when i start looking
for somewhere to settle
when i see
this town on a map i think maybe
it be a sign
see



mickey mumford be in miss rice
kindergarten class with i
he be
killed with he parent in a wreck
on they way back from a steelers
game
he be only six year old
which be a real plus so there be a
birth certificate if anyone check
but not much else
they die in
pennsylvania so there be no death
certificate in west virginia
that be
also good



and a birth certificate be enough



everything flow from that and what
do not
can be easily purchased



of course i train make it
easier
once you have do that there be
not much data you can not access and
use any way you want

in a free society you be who you
say you be
people should remember that before
they go around knocking this country
skip all this beer get i sleepy

but you studied psychology right
you do the train and just never
get the degree

no
no train

psych major

english lit

jeez man
but you be good at it

i understand what it be like to want
to leave a problem behind
that be
all most people be looking to do
mainly i listen

where you going
i have get a million
question

see you thursday
regular time

so we get on this incredible steam
engine train that run up into the
mountain
she toss a paper
grunt
and this trip be everything it be
cracked up to be
an open car
great view the mountain air blowing
through
we be sitting there marry
for six year and he say how he
like it good when i put i hair
back

that be not so good

you be do great

i do not know if i be going to make it
the whole way

it do not matter
go on

oh
this make i sound irrational
which be probably right but there
be something about he saying this
it be maybe the millionth time he would
told i about some preference of
he
well i be so
tire of it
seem like i whole life someone
be telling i
i be just not
get it right
can we rest for a
second

you be purposely making i talk while
we do this
because you think this be good
for i
and you be a sadistic bastard

yes

who think there be nothing really
wrong with i

oh there be something wrong with
you all right
especially after
hearing that dream of yours about
the RotoRooter

that be really bad be not it

disgusting

and i will bet you can interpret the
whole thing

it be pretty obvious to a train
professional

i hate those dream where everything
mean something

be that when you split up

no that would be a good story but that
be just the begin of the end
we go on for another year or so

so whose route be this

brady peck
fourteen year old
live next door

and he be where

in the capitol for boy nation
five day
why

i be think a gal could make a good
living do this
how hard could it
be squeezing out some fourteen year
old

you like it

it be all right

then you can expect i at

tomorrow morning

mortality james said
the skull will grin in at the
banquet


i have run on
forgive i
we be here
to talk about you

be we

what ernest mean i think be we be
very interest in other
methodology
different kind of
train
we be great believer in
learning from each other
i have learned
so much from ern dr
delbanco

and i from phyllis

back to a previous
thread
so
the university of kentucky
who run the program down there

i mentor be an amazing teacher
named benton Mandlebaum
die quite
tragically in the collapse of a
gazebo

i think i have hear of he
a
disciple of Rothberg be not he

it be possible
i do not know about
that

i suppose you extended train be
at an institution in that area

lots of institution
i graduate
advisor believe we should experience
as many environment as possible
prison clinic halfway house
for a while i be chief therapist in
a shop mall
have a little spot
next to the yogurt place

interesting approach
what be his
name

dorothy fowler
fantastic woman
she
passed last year in a train wreck
damned amtrak

i trained in the east myself
cornell and i do not care what
anyone say there really be regional
difference
i find the state
certification exam out here quite
harrow
do you

oh yeah very tough
but i guess
that be good
to keep out the quack

which examiner do you have
i
probably know he

wallace franklin
from Greensburg

that be a terrible thing

i do not even know why hanggliding
be considered a legitimate sport

we be interest in any new therapy
how would you characterize you
approach

i approach

yes
you particular approach

i do not have one really
most of the
time i be fake it
see i think
there be not much that can be do
about most problem
they be too
complicate too deeprooted by the
time i hear about they
the most i
can do usually be look and listen
real closely try to catch some
glimpse of the secret life everybody
get
if i can get a sense of that
well then maybe
just maybe i
can help they out a little

i see

the argument have nothing to do
with it



i understand
i just want to know
what the argument be about

i have ordered some book
the
great book ever written




Uhhuh
what be they

oh all the great writer
shakespeare charles dickens moby
dick
those people
each be bound
in genuine premium leather with
carat gold accent
it be a magnificent
set and only
per volume
right away you get great expectation
for just




one hundred book

it be irrelevant
it have nothing to
do with what happen



what happen

we argued on sunday
he go to work
on monday and stay in the city
during the week like always
but on
thursday when he normally come
home he do not
do not call either
not till saturday afternoon

you must have be concern

it be happen before
i be shock by how little i be feeling
i can not understand it
i will probably have a complete
depressoid collapse soon will not i

doubtful
what do he say

he said he be not coming back
he
said it be not working for he any
more
that it have not work for
he for quite a while
you know
what i regret the most
i be sorry i
let he make the kid take he name
he be an acquirer
he liked to acquire thing

you think that have something to do
with i problem
ordering all those
thing

like i be on some kind of campaign
to outacquire he
excite now playing
it out
if i be just an acquisition to
he and he lost interest once he
have i

that can not be it
it be too simple
and besides i still like it
this
morning i ordered a marble turtle
cheese board from the Horchow
collection
can i tell you something just awful
you know how people who be just
asshole will sometimes look at a
woman who be get problem and say
what she need be a good shtupping


well there may be something to that
jeremy do not keep up he end oh
what difference do it make
why do i feel elate
be i in denial
you know what it feel like

i know i time up but i have get to
get this out while i have get hold of
it

take you time

when i be in high school the
thing i wanted most when i be stick
in class the thing i be always
desperately in pursuit of be a
hall pass
that be all i wanted
i
loved moving freely around the school
while everybody else be trapped in
there
and that be how i feel right
now
like i have some giant all
day hall pass

i god do it just get hot in here
or what

see you next time
i will probably be
a basket case by then

there be no shame in get a little
therapy right doc

i hope nothing you be about to see
will shake you faith in i

pretty creepy huh
be you totally
disgust

skip you be a visionary
that can
be a burden

this do not seem a little
perverse

there be a lot of lonely people in
the world
Somebodys going to figure
this out someday

it be not going to be i
i be giving
it up

really

it be all you fault

right now of the two of we i be the
only one in love
but i be very stoke

doc how i can be of help to you

sorry

wow

i be here for you doc

skip you know that it be improper
completely unethical for a license
psychologist to carry on a romantic
relationship with one of he patient

i guess that make sense

yes yes it do

you have fallen in love with one of
you patient

doc

i
see where you be going here
it be a
mess

yep

do not you find it incredibly
convenient that everyone who could
possibly corroborate he story have
recently die some exotic death

they be neither all recent nor exotic

but they be certainly dead
and yes
personally i find it a bit odd

it could happen
what about he state
certification exam
the record
seem to be in order

what be easy than hacking you way
into a state computer and insert
some number
for all you know he
never even take the exam

that be true

i do not know that it be all that
easy

doctor correct i if i be wrong but
it sound to i like you have go for
this guy story hook line and bull
twaddle

in you way

which i do not necessarily agree

but you do come to i

i guess be these image be burned
into you brain when you be young
maybe if we could nail down the exact
fantasy that be haunt you
maybe you could get past they
anyway i think we could try an
experiment

and the experiment be in here

i think this be a
dumb idea

i just hear myself talking and i
realize i be completely unqualified
to be do this
let we forget the
whole thing

whoa whoa what be you do
i

there be absolutely no reason to think
this be going to have any impact on
you
i be embarrass to have

i agree with you that you do not
know what you be talking about
that be
what i have be saying all along

i can guarantee you that looking at
the lose ark or whatever you get in

be tearing i up inside
and i know
phyllis be not get what she needed
from it
what have start as a genuine
respect i think for each other
professional ability and become
over time a personal attraction have
somehow
migrate into a rather
torrid sexual relationship

i will not go into that today
though
if we should continue these session
as i certainly hope we will there
be some aspect of that i would
like to look at
god know i have
listen to enough people giving i
the juicy
at any rate i just wanted to
acknowledge the catalyzing effect
you comment have on i
i just hope
that it do not come roil back
upon you like some dreadful undertow

how do you mean

well
you see when i broke it off
with phyllis she be naturally upset
and she become more determine than
ever to pursue certain how to put
it doubt she be be harboring

what kind of doubt

about you
you background and
you qualification
i be afraid
phyllis somehow get you mix up in
she fury with i and actually take
the whole issue to the state board

i see

and please for whatever small way i
may have encourage this accept i
apology
there be good news though

what be that

phyllis have decided to leave town
and pursue she practice in the city
which leaf you the only psychologist
in town

dr
sheeler be leaving mumford
i be
sorry to hear that

as you can imagine i own feeling
about this be mixed
unlike i
must say those of i wife



old man Sutters young bride have get
i in hot water all right and now i
be bein deal the beat of i
life
if there would just be two of
those bastard it would have be a
little closer



the landlady be good at quite a few
thing but doctore be not one of
they



lucky for i one of the other
boarder the broad who live
downstairs in the front room



be a nurse



and she have way to make you feel
well they do not teach in nurse
school

here

i too doc
and i can not tell you
what that package mean to i

i need to talk to you
doctor
can
i come in

of course

we have not meet in this office since
that first time
this be how a real
professional and he client be
suppose to see each other

it might have be more appropriate if
we have follow a traditional approach
to the doctorpatient relationship

be something wrong sofie

yes something very wrong dr
mumford

you be upset

how intuitive
that must take year
of train right there
maybe you
can guess what have upset i

be it something you have hear about
i

no it be not something i have hear
about you
it be someth
why
be there something i should
have hear about you

why do not you tell i what be on you
mind

may i

all right
i be going to come right
out and say this because that be
what you shrink be for right so
you can tell he what be bother
you

Umhuh

first of all i have be feeling
much well lately
i do not know if
the syndrome be over if it be just
run it course or something but i
feel a hundred per cent good than
when i first come to you

i be glad

given that i be obviously not going
to be judging thing in the most
realistic way

i do not follow you

i be saying that since i be do so
much well which i attribute to
you i be liable to misinterpret
some of i feeling

okay

the point be this i be not a blank
page
i do not just fall off the
turnip truck
do you know what i
mean

i think so

i know a little about psychology
i
take three different course in
college
it be true none of they
be above the two hundred level
but i take they
and there be one
concept i remember very well

what be that

transference

transference

yes and that be what i have get
right now
i have taken i feeling
of gratitude
and relief
and
transferred they onto
you
i have
taken all those warm grateful
emotion and confused they with
feeling for you
so that now i be
under the delusion
that i be in love with you

hello

hello

i think you can understand why i
have some serious question about
you method
i mean obviously it
become much more likely that i be
going to have confusion about this
when you idea of treatment be to go
walking in the wood and up to make
outsville and do all these highly
romantic activity

we have a paper route together
for godssake
do you understand how
i might be a little resentful
knowing
that this socalled love i be feeling
be totally bogus and just a pathetic
case of
transference

yes

maybe you ought to think about how
you be going to fix this
and when
you do
suddenly losing she
will
please get back to i

hey Ainge

doc

lily

doc

deal

eventually

i want to give you something
will

thanks lily i do not need anything

hard thing

that be it
that be what you be giving
i

clean up the mess
no matter what it
take

what it might take be
do time

too bad
that be tough i mean it
i be not unsympathetic
but skip say
you be in love

then it be worth it

i will tell she tonight
