pity

but why do you call i mr

person by he first name
but if it
really matter to you i call
you
toto

bless you toto

rome i want to come along too

with those two
they be bad than cannibal
they will
take advantage

it must be for you
they have be
calling all afternoon
they wanted to
know if you be leaving this evening
or tomorrow

double whisky please

excuse i miss
she turn to look at he
indifferent but friendly
he look at she wonderful
blue eye

i be so sorry i think you be
someone else

well

what be you think toto

i be think
that we have never
talk mamma
when i be little i
see you as if you be already old
that be probably true with all kid
who know
she nod then sit down
before he
he stroke she
old skinny heavily
vein hand

but only now do i realize you be
young you be beautiful have a
whole life before you
but how
how could you have live alone
all that time with no one to look
after you
you could have
remarried
why not
at the time i
probably would not have understood
but i would have later

i never have anybody
if that be what
you think
i do not want anybody
i
always remain faithful
first to
you father then to you to lia
that be the way i be make there be
nothing i can do about it
and you be like i you be too honest
and too attached to the thing you
love
but i do not know if that be a
good thing
faithfulness be a bad
business
if you be faithful you be
always alone
be immerse in
the profound truth of
those word
and he say
nothing
the silence be
broken by the ring of
the phone
menace
sound which
cannot bear
he know they
be calling he from rome
give a nervous gesture
stand up and pull out
the plug
the silence
return the whistle of
the wind
lower she
eye

it be i fault
it would have be
well if i have not called you

no
it be nothing to do with you
it be just that i be scare of coming
back
now after all these year i
think i be strong that i have
forgotten lots of thing
instead i
find it be quite the opposite as if i
have never left
and yet i look at
lia and feel as if i do not know she
and you mamma
i abandoned you
run away like a thief think only
of myself and never give you
an explanation

and i never ask for one
you have
nothing to explain
i always think
that what you do be right and that
be that
with no beat around the
bush
only one thing make i suffer
bolting the door shut before going to
bed at night

you never used to do that

no no
when you used to work at
the movie i could never get to
sleep at night until you come home
then when you arrive i pretended to
be asleep but i hear all you
movement
then when you fell asleep
i would get up and bolt the door
then
when you left every time i do it i
feel as if i have left somebody
outside the door far away
listen to his
word surprise
and entrance by the
poetry of she way of
speaking

but you be right to leave
you
succeed in do what you wanted to
do
when i call you a different woman
always answer
i pretend i know they
so they will not have to go through the
embarrassment of introduce
themselves
i be sure they take i for a crazy old
woman
but so far i have never hear
one voice that really love you
i
would have known
and yet i would like
to see you
settled down
fall in
love
but you life there
here there be
nothing but ghost toto

i do not want to
i have to fight
tooth and nail
but in the end i
win
be unable to
smile
it be as if the void
be grow and swell
within
thunder and
lightning shatter the
roar of the wind and
sea hut it do not rain
now she smile jade away

at that time
i be waiting for

what she have say strike
he as grotesque

stroke he hair as if to
restrain he sink
heart give a sweet
smile

but what be the point of talking about

we risk be pathetic and
ridiculous
and she try to change
the subject

you still live in rome

what do you mean you be waiting
for i
what be you saying
he control himself at
once continue breathe
heavily

leaving a trace nothing
i will tell
you how many year have go by
more
than thirty

i keep that date
laugh at the
absurdity of it

nervous heartbroken
laugh which slowly melt
away as she go on to
say

but i be late
tear continue to stream
out of she blue eye but
she tell she story in a
calm voice

i have a fight with i family
i tried
to convince they again that they
could not separate we
but it be
futile
they have decided to leave
sicily once and for all
which be
what we do
i do not know what to do
any more what to say
and i said
yes i would do whatever they wanted
in
return i father promised to let i
see you one last time to say
goodbye
but i hope that by seeing
each other we could take advantage of
it and make a decision
i think
we would run away together
she hold back she sob
dry she tear with the
back of she hand and
continue

i father drive i to the movie
theatre
but you be not in the
projection booth
only alfredo

and i do not have time to wait for
you to comeback

and fiat i be leaving the same
evening and i ask he to tell you
everything

listen carefully then

easy easy
listen carefully to what i have to
say
if you want i to tell toto what
you have tell i i will
but if you
want i advice forget it
it be
well for both of you if you do not
see each other
give a start
of resentment listen
with surprise

dear girl fire always turn into
ash
even the deep love end
sooner or later
and after that other
love appear lots of they
toto he
can not understand fiat now
if i tell
he he will not believe it he d be
capable of killing i
but you can
understand you have get to
understand
do it for he

it be the first time i have have to
chance to tell the story
i never
mention it to anybody

alfredo damn he
he cast he spell
on you too

i told he i would take he advice
but
before i go away i left you that
note
give she a
quick look a questioning
look
he listen

i be on i way down the stairs
she voice continue laid
over the


i think alfredo could not see i
so
i snuck back up
she tiptoe back without
making any noise
go
over to the filmwinder
take out a pen look for
a scrap of paper but
do not see any
she eye
fall on the film receipt
hanging on the nail
she
tear off the top one
turn it over and
scribble a message on the
back

i write you where you could find i
and that i would wait for you

but you disappeared all the same

oh how i look for you elena
you will never know
i write
telephone nothing
nobody ever
answer
but i dream of you for
year
that be why i go away
and
never come back here
and he anguish break
free dissolving into
quiet almost childish
tear
be startle
by he reaction
she
caress he
passionately
they embrace
and remain like that she
with she face buried in
he shoulder he leaning
on hers with he tear
fill eye

even as the year passed in all the
woman i meet i be only looking for
you
i have success it be true but
there be always something miss
she be deeply moved go
on caressing he gently
until he calm down
the
car window be steamed
up
the sea the harbor
the wave have
disappeared
nothing
remain but the sound of
the storm
take
she face between his
hand
they gaze at each
other they face
practically touch
he
murmur

i would never have imagined that all this
have to end because of the man who be
like a father to i
crazy lunatic
she give a faint smile


he be not crazy
in the begin i
be upset
i think i really hated
he
but then with time i
understood what he said
and you
silence too

but i never see that note
he squint as if to
stress the absurdity of
the idea

i must have covered it with i hand
without realize it that be the only
explanation
but strangely enough
be not surprise


what difference do it make to find
an explanation
that be the way it
go
but alfredo do not betray you
he be the only one who really
understood you
salvatore if you have
chosen to be with i you would have
never make you film
and that would
have be a pity
because they be
wonderful i have see they all
she eye glitter with
joy then she smile
almost ironically

but you should not have go and
changed you name
you should have
keep you own

these be the thing he left to
you

when they show you film on
television he be happy
he would plop
himself down there and all he
ailment be forgotten
he know all
the word by heart every one and
i would describe what be going on
and
when the paper talk about
you i have to read they two or three
time

do he ever think of meeting i

no never
one time you mother said
that if he wanted you would have surely
come
he get furious and said no
toto must not come back to Giancaldo
never
he do not say it to be mean
he be a decent man
who know what
he could have be think
towards
the end he would say such strange thing
and a moment before he shut he eye
he told you mother not to let you
know

salvatore forgive i
i will explain
later what happen
not finding you
here be terrible
unfortunately
this evening i mother and i be
