i be meeting biff at the
flagpole



let i see it again


well
i do not think it be anything to
worry about
it will probably just
clear up by itself
cut down on greasy food and chocolate
no french fry that kind of thing
aside
to the mother
it be just a teenage thing


get a galher name be sue
she
know just what to do



wop bop a loo bopa wop bam
boom


what will it be

gee whizz bud
guess i will just have the
usual
cheeseburger and a cherry coke

i too
sound swell

really
it seem so fattening

two cheeseburger two cherry coke


there be not any cheeseburger

look
i think we talk about this i
think we said


Ohwhat be the point bud

mere

what do you say


well
i be not sure i see the point
anymore

what be you talking about
you make
hamburger
that be the point


no i know
i know i do
but it be always the same you know
grill the bun flip the meat melt the
cheese
it never change
it never
get any good or bad

just listen to i


like the other night when i closed
up by myself
that be different

forget about that


oh
okay
beat
low
but i really liked it

look you can not always like what you do
sometimes you just do it because it be
you job
and even if you do not like it
you just get to do it anyway


why

so they can have they hamburger


you know what i really like

but they do win they all gus
they have
always win they all

chartreuse umber blue aqua ox
blood green peach crimson
yellow olive and magenta

pleasant but there be so many
thing that be so much good
like silly
or sexy
or
dangerous
or wild
or
brief
and every one of those thing be
in you all the time if you just
have the guts to look for they
look at those face back there
they be no different than you be
they just happen to see
something inside themselves that
you do not want to
