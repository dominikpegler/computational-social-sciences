some part of body be find down by
the river
they be from people who be
reported missing
they never find one

that be what be creepy
they have have she under surveillance for a
couple of month except i do not know what

Okidoke ed
thanks



you hungry or thirsty or both

i do not know

i would like to talk to you about something

just a minute
pull over and wait a
minute

please do not say anything to mike

i do not want to because any trouble

i be here be not i

i guess mikes get some sort of sport
practice in the afternoon

Ooooo you be smart
just do not get too
smart


alright now tell i
what be it

there be opportunity in life for gain
knowledge and experience
sometimes in
some case
it be necessary to take a risk
i get to think
i will bet a person could
learn a lot by get into that woman
apartment
you know
sneak in and hide
and observe

you said it be a strange world
and you be the strange part of it
be
you crazy
she be possibly involved in
murder
this give i the creep

settle down
i have a plan which i think
will work
there be very little for you
to do but i do need you help
be not you curious about i plan

think and intrigued plus she
be beginning to like jeffrey
it would not hurt to hear the plan i guess

alright
the first thing be to get into she
apartment and open a window that i could
crawl into later

now how be you going to do that

right out in the car i happen to have some
old overall and a bug spray rig
i will
go to she apartment and be the pest control
man
i will spray she apartment
after a
few minute you will knock on she door
draw she attention away from i and i
will then jimmy a window

what will i say when she come to the door

you will be a Jehovahs witness
i have a
few awake magazine for you
you do not
have to keep she very long
a few second
be all i will need
Whatiya think

i do not know
it sound like a good
daydream
but actually do it be too
weird
too dangerous

let we just try the first part
if that
go well we will see about the rest
no one
will suspect we because no one would
believe two people like we would be crazy
enough to do something like this

you have get a point there


now
we will walk over so there be no license
plate and you give i at least three
minute
i can stall if it be more but i
need time to find a good window
alright
