ben stop to think if he can somehow move the mirror to have it
face the last booth he might be able to see what truly happen
inside
ben unhooks the mirror
it be way too heavy and bulky to carry
he let we it slide down
the wall

he reach the last dressing room
through the reflection in the mirror he examine the interior
of the cubicle
in the dark he catch sight of

the body
with he eye fixed on the mirror ben walk backward towards
the dressing room
he be scare of what he be about to discover

the water have obliterate most of the
mark
no trace of struggle or break
entry the entrance door be locked

he would never have laid a finger on
she
when they father die ben take
care of he sister
angela mean the
world to he

listen so far he statement be
pretty consistent with the fact
we
checked it out he do place a call
from work at
and the woman
downstairs neighbor claim they
start notice the water leakage at
around two in the morning
the daytime
security guard lorenzo Sappeli
confirm he come on after bens shift
at seven a
m
the only strange thing
and it may just be a coincidence be
that ben told Sappeli that he have
decided to quit he job as if he be
planning to go away somewhere
do he
mention anything about it to you

no lately communication have not quite

have he share for the day

you know what be going to happen if you
let he go
he will not stop here
i know
he he will not stop until he find who
do this to she

suddenly confront with two entirely
separate ego two entirely separate
world that can surface at any given

feel of selfhatred generally
trigger by a psychological shock can
split the personality in two hence
create two or more personality
with distinct memory or behavior
pattern within the same individual
the patient then have a faulty
perception of the existence of two
distinct world which be principally
the real word and the world inside
the mirror

through the back window we see amy in front of the house
growing more and more distant
anna medical file lie open on the passenger seat at the top
of the page we can read she old address in pennsylvania


aerial shot
we fly over a lake the water be so placid that the forest and
outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off it surface
create two perfectly symmetrical landscape
we glide over the treetop diving deeper into the forest to
follow the main road that zigzag along the slope of the hill




sign on the edge of the road indicate mile to
pennsylvania
ben focus on the road determined to put an end to what hide
behind the mirror and to rescue he family



bens car slow down as he reach a dirt road
on one of the mailbox standing on the edge of the road he
spot the name Esseker


the wind blow over the land
in the winter season the muddy field have little to offer to
the few starve crow flying over they
feel of desolation
and solitude hang over the desert landscape
bens car have left the asphalt road behind driving through the
countryside down a wind dirt road



an old farmhouse stand at the very end of the path
if it
be not for the park pickup truck and the few piglet running
wild one would think that the farmhouse be abandoned
ben get out of the car and go to knock on the door
he shoe sink into the mud
he walk up the step of the porch
and peek inside the house through the front window
in the dark
he discern the silhouette of a person who be watch
he
can not help but notice all the mirror have be covered or
turn towards the wall
big dog bark behind the window
ben step back surprise
the front door open before ben have even make he presence
known
young man stare at he in silence

hello

woman voice be hear from inside

Jimmys mother stare at he for a moment with a suspicious look

jimmy go tell grandpa that there be a
man here who like to talk to he
about he sister


we be in the dark basement under the farmhouse
the door to
the first floor open letting the light in
ben appear next to
the silhouette of an old man year old
anna elder brother
robert walk down the step signale ben to follow he

you know up to this day the vision
of anna fit still haunt i at
night
they walk through the basement towards an old wooden door

i helped i father fix up this part
of the basement especially for she
the old man turn the key in the padlock
slowly the door
swing open reveal

she fit be too violent
i mother
could not take she scream anymore
what be left of a very primitive childes room

rather than a cell it more
resemble a

as he be talking image flash on screen painful memory from
that time come back to he
anna be carry to the basement she innocent eye full of
hate
it be even hard to recognize the face of a little girl
she
howl scream
she nail digging into she own flesh
she
unnatural strength and the violent thrash of she arm and
leg




we have every priest doctor healer
coming from all over the state one
after the other
but no one could help
she
ben come closer to the iron bar of the cage
he can see anna
scratch mark next to the bed giving he imagination a taste of
she plight and suffer

finally dr
kane from new york

he
rejected the idea of demonic
possession said he do not believe in
it
he be convince that anna
suffer from a rare form of
personality disorder

for whom

at the time that i be at st

dr
kanes therapy for personality
disorder consist of locking the

i spent
the dark day of i life in that
room
on the th day the nurse find
i lifeless almost dead
since that
day i have never have another fit

glass dig deeper into the elderly woman flesh which only
seem to provide she an intense pleasure

animalistic incomprehensible gurgle
in an effortless movement anna push he away
she demonic strength be ten time he
ben be merely a puppet a
rag doll that she send flying into the air only to crash
violently against the brick wall
blood squirt onto the surface of the water

underground passageway
on the other side he land on the ground in the dark
he
strive to regain consciousness
ben take advantage of the brief respite to pull out he gun but
anna appear from the dark and in a flash she strike a
backhanded blow that send the gun off into the air
she lift ben up and throw he across the room

the other trying to hold on but the pipe give way and break
off from the wall
once again ben be send flying down the tunnel
he struggle to get back on he foot
apart from the sound of the flow gas a disturb silence
surround the subterranean passageway
ben make out anna silhouette hide behind the leaking gas
pipe
with he bloody face ben be no long the same man anymore
something in he eye have shift
rage and violence have
replace the terror and dread
he be determined to put an end to
the creature no matter what happen
he slide the weapon in he belt and step with he bare hand
towards what once be anna
crouch over in the water the demon look up ready to charge
ben take another step forward with the same determination
the
creature thrust itself against he

ben use all he strength to
keep he assailant jaw at a distance
in a swift movement ben turn around



despite be momentarily immobilised the demon seem
unaffected by the near total destruction of it outer she will
on

trap
ben move away keeping an eye on anna
he take he gun and
aim it at she
ben be exhausted
with he arm outstretched he
be ready to shoot waiting for the right moment
the silhouette suddenly emerge from the dark
ben stand by
the demon go through the cloud of gas ben fire



ben throw himself to the ground to avoid the flame








crack appear everywhere
the brick wall begin to fall apart
part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor cave in
ben get back on he foot and dash for the stairs
totally burn flesh charred anna be enraged by she prey
resistance
the blaze demon run after ben
behind they one after the other section of the wall
collapse
ben run as fast as he can
anna be coming closer to he when suddenly


ben narrowly escaped the collapse
he reach the staircase and
catch sight of the exit above when suddenly

ben find himself crushed along the floor and penetrate the
mirrore water surface



all of she effort be in vain
amy be unable to bring back she
son
nonetheless she continue with the same determination refuse
to accept reality
she finally break down plead with the sky above

lose and float in this strange and unfamiliar place ben
turn and see michaels bodysoul which be also trapped in this
parallel dimension on the other side of the mirror
in the distance he can see the surface leading to the hallway
of the new jersey house
above it amy try to resuscitate
michael



ben grab he son and hold he tightly in he arm for a
moment then push he towards the surface

everything
seem back to normal

yes sweetheart it be over
amy hold she two child tightly savoring this moment of joy
and relief
through the window we see the first light of dawn appear on
the horizon


the sunbeam slice through the windowpane of the glass dome
above the entrance hall of the department store
the pigeon fly in and out
the burn mannequin be still standing in the middle of the
ruin
s

the floor have completely subside
it look like there be just
an earthquake under the build
in the middle of the pile of debris something in the rubble
begin to move


it be ben
he gasp for air
wound and covered in dust it be a
miracle that he have survive



he struggle back to he foot and climb over the block of
concrete to regain the ground floor
limping he cross the entrance hall
he discovery of the
absence of mirror on the wall bring a smile to he face he
have finally triumph over the mirror that he once believe to
be indestructible


ben step out of the department store walk out of the close
off area and reach the street
police car fire truck and ambulance with spin light
have surround the fence
ben approach the scene
he need medical attention
he catch
sight of lorenzo talking to some policeman
ben stop dead in
he track


ben glance at the police vehicle and they license plate
how be it possible

ben step back in panic
as he walk away from the scene we discover something else in
the back of the ambulance




ben walk up west th street to broadway and stop at the
intersection of the street paralyze with fear
the activity of time square seem normal for an early morning
car driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the
pedestrian but

ben turn around towards a glass build where a homeless
person be sleep
he eye fill with horror




ben press he hand against the glass
the reflection of the
world surrounding he be the right way around in the mirror but
he remains invisible
he remove he hand from the mirror leaving a clear and well
define handprint on the reflective surface
ben slowly come to realize what be happening to he







back in the ambulance a paramedic come to close the back door
the vehicle start and leaf the mayflower


the ambulance turn on the avenue


in the back of the ambulance as the vehicle drive away we
discover that another corpse be laid out next to anna

it finger suddenly twitch
be it the bumpy road
the dead finger twitch again and

it turn it head
