aye magic

let we have a look at the replay
william move you head
look at the
size of that ooys heed
i be not
kidding

tooth pick

stuart you be going to give the boy
a complex

i be not kidding
that be a huge
noggin
it have it be own weather
system

heed
move

be that enough potato charlie

enough to recreate devil tower in
close encounter

do i smell haggis

aye you do

i will put it in the frig

dad what be you do to tony now
why do you abuse he mind like this

that be the late report from lyndon

larouche outline how the queen
and the rothschilds mastermind the
soviet overthrow so that they could
reclaim land they have annex during
the holy roman empire

you know a lot of this make sense

i think you be suffering from the
stockholm syndrome where the hostage
start to relate to they captor

listen sonny jim it be a known fact
there be a society of the five
wealthy people in the world called
the Pentaverate who run everything
and meet three time a year at a
secret country mansion in colorado
known as the meadows


and that be obviously why we have not
hear about it in the newspaper

inappropriately angry
loud
that be right
they fuckin own the
paper smartass
and everything
else
why do you think Scotlands
not be able to get independence
because the queen the Pentavirate
and those english dome head in west
minster will not have it

who be the other member of this
pentaverate

the queen the Rothchilds the Gettys
the vatican and colonel sanders
before he go tit up
oh i hated
the colonel with he wee beady eye
and that smug look on he face

dad how can you hate the colonel


because the colonel put an addictive
chemical in it that make you crave
it fortnightly

interesting
coocoo

once a week you should routinely
haul i ass into you office accuse
i of be a maverick and complain
to i that you be sick and tire of
defending i screwball antic to the
commissioner

well as you may know tony
i do not
report to a commissioner
i report
to a committee some of whom be
appointed some elected and the
remainder coopt on a biannual
basis
quorum

police work should be all about
running around following up crazy
hunch that turn out to be right
going out on a limb

well tony i have never see it that
way
for i police work be all about
follow procedure and remain
accountable to the general public

captain
when i joined the police
force i think i be going to be
serpico and unfortunately i end up
be toma
i would have settled for
beretta

that be interesting tony
i be perturbed
that you should be so disillusion

hey tony i get to talk to you

oh hello charlie

way here
you guy probably have
something you want to talk about
and tony if you have still get stuff
you want to sort out please you
know where the suggestion box be

nice guy
hey what be up

i be have doubt about be a cop
again
it be not like how it be on
cop show
all i do be fill out paper
and report

let i get this straight you captain
have not threatened to have you up on
charge so fast you will not know what
hit you

no
he be never once said to i that
he be going to throw the book at
i so hard it will knock i ass from

anyway what be
up

have you hear of this case
mrs

she murder she husband on they
honeymoon and then change she
identity and marry again

i never hear of it
so what

curious that be all
i read about
it and
i think i be dating mrs


two word charlie
get therapy
they have doctor that deal
specifically with this illness

Everythings add up tony
one of
the victim be a martial art expert
last night at dinner she put a
martial art move on i dad

there about twenty thousand people
in san francisco who be martial
art expert
should i arrest all of
they too

if they also say ralph in they sleep
i think it would be a good start
ralph elliot
plumber from san
francisco
missing since his
honeymoon

you be just get scare
like the
dream you feel harriet could be the
one so you start to suspect she of
thing because deep down you be scare
that if she be the one you will marry
and marriage to you be death

hey do not analyze i dream okay
they be i dream
analyze you own
dream
it be not a marry thing tony
it be a murder thing
harriet live in atlantic city right
well so do this guy right around
the same time she left town

larry leonard a crooner who make a
name for himself for be able to
sing in six different language the
song only you
do she know the song only you


i do not know
it have not come up yet

charlie move past it
you be running
you life by the national enquirer

what
it be the fifth high
circulating newspaper in the united
states
mrs

please
look it up

there be no record of any death
all
three of these guy be report
missing around the time of they
honeymoon but so be the wife
no
picture of any of the bride
for
all we know they just picked up and
moved away

and ralph elliot too

charlie you be talking about three
guy over a seven year span
that be
hardly news
no death
elopement in
this state as of this day be still
not illegal

re
the article
yeah well murder be
and this article
say that these man be murdered by
the same woman

mr
mackenzie we have find that
most national enquirer article be
actually base on we own police
report
they take the fact and
fabricate a story around they

it be true charlie
you get to realize
that
i mean personally i would
lie to you but kathy
have this
crazy notion of always telling the
truth
you feel well now

it guess so
it be just
if i have a
photo of harriet i could show it to
the relative or friend of mrs
xs
victim to identify she

charlie listen to i
there be no
mrs

drop it
okay

you be back
but harriets not here
yet

maybe i could wait

sure
that would be fine

inside
i be hope

i be glad you ask
i do not want to
be so forward
i mean if you be
waiting inside then you feel
obligate to entertain i and keep
up the conversation just to be polite
and really you head might be totally
elsewhere and then there be the chance
that you would really want to talk
and it be i who be busy but in an
attempt not to be rude i sit there
and listen to some story that you
do not really want to tell and i do not
really have time to hear
you know

i could not agree with you more

i think about a lot of thing

look if you have work to do you go
right ahead
i mean to tell you the truth i would
love to see you work

okay
what would you like i to do

no i do not want to see you work
i
be talking about you work
you
photograph
that one that i see be
so wonderful and

harriets far more talented than i
am

well i be sure it be so subjective
anyway and
rose show i you photo

hey these be some interesting photo
here
very impressive
nice shot of
Sauselito and
some good bondage
shot
lot of people would not think
to mix the two subject but they be
really a natural together
hey you would not happen to have any
picture of harriet by chance would
you

re
she card
well i do not think she would want to do
this sort of

no no not that
just in general
some photo
any little snapshot
would do

i doubt i would have any
harriet hate
be photograph



rose do i see charlies car out
in front

we be in here harriet

what be you guy do

oh nothing
just looking through
some of rose work

charlie wanted a photo of you

that too

why of i charlie

well sentimental reason
something
to remind i of you when we be not
together

there can you remember that

okay it be just i be going to give
one to i parent too and
another time would be fine
it be
hardly a matter of life and death

in the news tonight regarding a
beverly hills Jeweler morris cohan

you
do not want to drink i milkshake
so what right

regarding the murder between the two
partner we talk to toxicologist
dr
show on the issue

doctor be it possible that one could
be poisoned with no trace at all

certainly
there be plant that
grow very commonly in we own backyard
that could easily be ferment into
poison
take for instance the

get nervous
block out
harriet why do not we shut the light
off

really
and how easy it that to do

scarily enough quite simple
you
merely take the

block out the
again
maybe we should turn the light back
on
