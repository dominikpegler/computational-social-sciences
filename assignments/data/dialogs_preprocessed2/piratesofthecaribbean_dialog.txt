elizabeth

dear i do hope you demonstrate a bit
more decorum in front of commodore
norrington
after all it be only
through he effort that port royal have
become at all civilized

if you be out rolling scupper in
this tub you be either incredibly
brave or incredibly stupid

it be remarkable how often those
two trait coincide

it be a shilling for the dock
space and you be going to have to
give i you name

what do you say to three
shilling and we forget the name

welcome to port royal mr
smith

civilian

sorry i do not know

some sort of todo up at the fort eh
you two be not invited

no
someone have to make sure
this dock stay offlimits to
civilian

this must be some important boat

ship

ship

captain Norringtons make it he
flagship
he will use it to hunt
down the last dregs of piracy on
the spanish lake

commodore

right
commodore norrington

that be a fine goal i be sure
but it
seem to i a ship like that
make this one here just a wee
superfluous

oh the dauntless be the power in
these water true enough but
there be no ship that can match the
interceptor for speed

that so
i have hear of one suppose to
be fast nigh uncatchable
the black
pearl

there be no real ship as can match
the interceptor

the black pearl be a real ship

no it be not

you have see a ship with black sail
that be crew by the damn and
captain by a man so evil that hell
itself spit he back out

no

no

but i have see a ship with black sail

oh and no ship that be not crew by
the damn and captain by a man so
evil hell itself spit he back out
could possibly have black sail and
therefore could not possibly be any ship
other than the black pearl
be that
what you be saying

no

like i said there be no real ship
as can match hey

you

get away from there

would not have tell we

unless of course he know you would not
believe the truth if he told it to you

you look lovely
elizabeth

i apologize if i seem forward
but i must speak i mind

working up he
confidence to do so
this promotion confirm that i have
accomplished the goal i set for myself
in i career
but it also cast into
sharp relief that which i have not
achieve
the thing all man most
require
a marriage to a fine woman
you have become a fine woman
elizabeth

i can not breathe

i be a bit nervous myself

elizabeth

missed they

be not you going to save she

i can not swim

sailor

fine

do not lose these

not breathing

on you foot

elizabeth
be you all right

point north
and no ship
you be
without a doubt the bad pirate i have
ever hear of

ah but you have hear of i

carefully lieutenant

commodore i must protest
pirate or
not this man saved i life

one good deed be not enough to redeem a
man of a lifetime of wickedness

but it seem to be enough to condemn
he

indeed

finally

commodore norrington
i pistol and
belt please

commodore

elizabeth it be elizabeth

miss swann if you will be so kind

crossing blade with a pirate

back door
and now you have no weapon

who make all these

i do

you need to find yourself a girl
or maybe the reason you practice
three hour a day be you have find

pirate morgan and bartholomew
you must take i to you captain

i know the code

if an adversary demand parley
you can do they no harm until the
parlay be complete

it would appear so do you

to blaze with the code

she want to be taken to the
captain and she will go without a
fuss

we must honor the code

praise be

i sympathy friend you have

captain
sparrow

huh
last time i see you you be
all alone on a godforsaken
island shrink into the
distance
i would hear you would get
off but i do not believe it

do you sprout little wing and
flyaway

he fortune be not improved much

worry about you own fortune
the
low circle of hell be reserved
for betrayer
and mutineer

you be curse

the story be true

you know nothing of hell

i do not know we be taking
captive

she be invoke the right of
parlay
with captain Barbossa

i be here to

you will speak when spoken to

and you will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parlay

aye sir

i apology miss
as you be
saying before you be so rudely
interrupt

captain Barbossa
i have come
to negotiate the cessation of
hostility against port royal

there be a lot of long word in
there miss and we be not but
humble pirate
what be it you
want

i want you to leave
and never
come back

i be disinclined to acquiesce to
you request
mean no


very well

i will drop it

i hold be bursting with swag
that bit of shine matter to i
why

because it be what you be searching
for
you have be searching for it
for year
i recognize this ship
i see it eight year ago when we
make the cross from england

do you now

fine
i suppose if this be
worthless there be no reason to
keep it



you have a name missy

elizabeth
stop herself from
saying swann
then

turner
i be a maid in the governor
household
Barbossa react to the name
turner
it confirm what he have
suspect
the other pirate
surreptitiously exchange glance
and nod

you have get sand for a maid

thank you sir

and how do a maid come to own a
trinket such as that
family
heirloom perhaps

of course
i do not steal it if that be what
you mean

no no nothing like that
very well
you hand that over
we will put you town to we rudder
and never return

can i trust you

it be you who invoke the parlay
believe i miss you would best hand
it over now
or these be the
last friendly word you will hear

we bargain



still the gun and stow they
signal the man set the flag and
make good to clear port

wait
you must return i to shore
accord to the rule of the
order of the brother

first
you return to shore be
not part of we negotiation nor
we agreement and so i must do
nothing
secondly
you must be a
pirate for the pirate code to
apply
and you be not
and
thirdly

miss swann
elizabeth

they have taken she
they have taken
elizabeth

we be aware of the situation

we have to hunt they down and
save she

where do you propose we start
if
you have any information that
concern i daughter then share
it
if anyone do tell i
leave mr
turner

that jack sparrow
he talk
about the black pearl

mention it be more what he do

still

we can ask he where it be
maybe he can lead we to it

that pirate tried to kill i
daughter
we could never trust a
word he said

we could strike a bargain

no
the pirate who invaded this
fort left sparrow locked in his
cell
ergo he be not they ally
and therefore of no value
we will determine they most
likely course and launch a search
mission that sail with the tide

that be not good enough
this be
elizabeths life

mr
turner this be not the time
for rash action
do not make the mistake of
think you be the only man here
who love elizabeth
now go home

be you familiar with that ship
the black pearl

somewhat

where do it make berth

surely you have hear the story
the
black pearl sail from the dread isla
de Mureta
an island that cannot be
find except by those who already
know where it be

the ship real enough
so it
anchorage must be a real place
where
be it

why ask i

because you be a pirate

and you want to turn pirate
yourself

never
they take miss swann

so it be that you find a girl
well
if you be intend to brave all and
hasten to she rescue and so win fair
lady heart you will have to do it
alone
i see no profit in it for i

i can get you out of here

how
the key run off

i helped build these cell
those be
hookandring hinge
the proper
application of strength the door
lift free
just call for the right
lever and fulcrum



you name be turner

yes
will turner

will turner
i will tell you what mr
turner
i have
changed i mind
you spring i from
this cell and on pain of death i will
you to the black pearl
do we have an accord

agreed

agreed

someone will have hear that
hurry

not without i effect

we need to go

why be you bother with that

i business will
as for you business
one question or there be no use going
this girl what do she mean to you
how far be you will to go to save
she

i would die for she

good



ah now there be a lovely sight

i know the Harbormaster would not report
she
honest man be slave to they
conscience and there be no predict
they
but you can always trust a
dishonest man to stay that way

come aboard

i have not set foot off dry land i be
twelve when the ship i be on
exploded
it be be a sound policy

no worry there
she be far more
likely to rot out from under we

besides we be about to well
we prospect considerably

we be going to steal a ship
that
ship

commandeer
we be going to
commandeer a ship
nautical term

it be still against the law

so be breaking a man out of jail
face
it will
you may say you will never be a
pirate but you be off to a riproaring
start
i advice smile and enjoy it

this be either crazy or
brilliant

remarkable how often those two
trait coincide

everybody stay calm
we be taking
over the ship

aye
avast

you be serious about this

dead serious

you understand this ship cannot be
crew by only two man
you will never
make it out of the bay

we will see about that

sir i will not see any of i man killed
or wounded in this foolish enterprise

fine by i
we bring you a nice
little boat so you can all get back to
shore safe and sound

agreed
you have the momentary
advantage sir
but i will see you
smile from the yard arm sir

as likely as not
will short up the anchor we have
get ourselves a ship

little help

i can not believe he be do this

you do not believe he be telling the
truth either

do you have any idea boy what you be
do

no

Lookee there mate
we be
underway

commodore

moment

but

please

dammit man it appear someone be
stealing you ship

rash turner too rash

that be without doubt the bad
pirate i have ever see

they be coming

search every cabin every hold
down to the bilge

can you swim
can
you
swim

of course sir
like a fish
i
grow up summer living in dover
with i uncle

good

sailor
back to the interceptor

thank you commodore for get we
ship ready to make way
we would have have a
hard time of it by ourselves

raise the sail

the wind be quarter from astern
by the time we be underway
we will never catch they

we need only to come about to put
they in range of the long nines

hand
come about
jacket off the
cannon
we be to fire on we own ship

well to see it at the bottom of the
sea than in the hand of a pirate

captain there be a problem

he be disable the rudder chain sir

so it would seem

he be get to be the good pirate
i have ever see

so it would seem

you will be dining with the captain
and he request you wear this

tell the captain that i be disinclined
to acquiesce to he request

he said you say that
he also said if
that be the case you will be dining with
the crew and you will be naked

fine

maid or not it fit you

dare i ask the fate of it previous
owner

now none of that
please dig in

no need to stand on ceremony and no
call to impress anyone
you must be
hungry

try the wine

and the apple one of those next

it be poison

oh there would be no sense in kill
you miss turner

then why be not you eating

would that i could

do you not know what this be
then

it be a pirate medallion

it be a piece of the treasure of isla de
Muerta

ah so you do not know as much as you
pretend
back when cortes be cutting a
great bloody swath through the new
world a high priest give
he all the
gold they have with one condition
that
he spare the people live
of course
cortes be cortes he do not
he would have make a great pirate that one

so the priest with he die breath
called on the power of the blood of he
people and put on the gold a curse
if
anyone take so much as a single piece
as he be compel by greed by greed
he would be consume

within a day of leaving port for spain
the treasure ship carrying the gold
something go wrong
the ship run
aground every man aboard dead save
one
he survive long enough to hide
the gold ashore
over time the dark magic of the curse
seep into the place making it a
curse island
an island of death
isla
de Muerta

that be all very interesting but i
hardly believe in ghost story
any more

you idiot girl
it be no make
believe
i crew and i we find
the gold and we do more than
take one piece we take it all
rich man we be and we spent it
and trade it and give it away in
exchange

there be but one way to remove the
curse
all of the scatter piece
of the treasure must be restored
in full and the blood repay
he throw the page
aside
we have recovered every piece
save for this
and as for the blood
that be
what we have you for
pleasant finally
get to he point
and that be why there be no sense in
killing you
yet

apple

i be curious after killing i
what be it you be planning to do
next

look

the moonlight show we for
what we really be
we be not
among the live and so we cannot
die

but neither be we dead
we
have all the desire of the
live but cannot satisfy they
ten year i have be parched of
thirst and unable to quench it
ten year i have be starve to
death and have not die

and i have not feel anything for
ten year
not the wind on i
face nor the spray of the sea
reach toward
elizabeth
nor the flesh of a woman

you would best start believe in
ghost story miss turner
because now you be in one

for a man whose make an industry
of avoiding boat you be a quick
study

i worked passage from england as a
cabin boy
after i mother passed i come out
here
looking for i father

be that so

i father
william turner

i be not a simpleton
at the jail
it be only after you learned i
name that you agreed to help
since that be what i wanted i
do not press the matter
but now

i know he
probably one of the
few who know he as william
turner
most everyone just called
he bill or bootstrap bill

bootstrap


good man
good pirate
and clever
i never meet anyone with as
clever a mind and hand as he
when you be puzzling out that
cell door it be like seeing he
twin

that be not true

i swear you look just like he

it be not true that i father be a
pirate

figure you would not want to hear
it

he be a merchant marine
he be a
respectable man who obey the
law and follow the rule

you think you father be the only
man who ever live the glasgow
life telling folk one thing and
then going off to do another
there be quite a few who come here
hope to amass enough swag to
ease the burden of respectable
life
and they be all merchant
marine


i father do not think of i
mother he family as a burden

sure because he could always go
pirating

i father be not a pirate

put it away will
it be not worth
get beat again

you do not beat i
you ignore
the rule of engagement
in a fair
fight i would kill you

then that be not much incentive for
i to fight fair be it

as long as you be just hanging
there pay attention
must
should do do not shall shall
not those be just suggestion
there be only two absolute rule
tick they off on his
finger

what a man can do
and what a man
can i t do

for instance
you can accept that
you father be a pirate and still
a good man
or you can not
now
i i can sail this ship to
tortuga by myself


but i can not just let you drown

tortuga

oh do i forget to mention
that

we need a crew
we can manage the
ship between island but the open
sea that be another matter

just do it quickly

and the man who be sleeping it drink
it while listening to a proposition

aye that about do it

blast it i be already awake

i know
that be for the smell

just the one

make itast then
now what be the
nature of this venture of yours

first have you find i a crew

oh there be a hard tale jack
most of the decent pirate in town
will not sail with you seem to
think you be a jinx

now where i wonder would they
have get that idea

i be going after the black pearl

say again

ilm going after the black pearl
i
know where it going to be and
i be going to take it

jack it be a fool errand
you have
hear the tale they tell about
the pearl

aye and that be why i know where it be
going to be and that be why i know what
Barbossa be up to
all i need be a
crew

fool errand

not if the fool have something
Barbossa want

need

and you have get that have you

the son of old bootstrap bill
turner

well lookee there

good seafaring man faithful hand
before the mast every one worth his
salt
and crazy to boot

cotton here be mute sir
poor
devil have he tongue cut out

so he go and trained the parrot to
do the talk for he nobody know
how
nobody know the parrot name
neither so we just call it cottons
parrot


mr
cotton
do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow order and stay
true in the face danger and almost
certain death

wind in you
wind in you

mostly that seem to mean eye


that go for the rest of you
danger and near certain death
for we be to sail for the isla de
Muerta to rescue the daughter of
governor swann
an equal share of the
reward shall be

shut up before you lose they all

these be the only one worth
have
and we be going to need they

that fool will have we lose the
canvas and the mast besides

Werd good drop canvas sirl

she can hold a bit longer

what be in you head to put you in such
a fine mood

we be catching up

isla de Muerta
isla de Muerta
off the port bow

order captain

bring she in not too close
i will not
brave the reef not until high tide
we
lay anchor before dark

that be if it first do not
sink back down to hell from where
it come

bear three point starboard

six point port

leave handedropes be coil against
the sun or it be bad luck
Antyclockwise

how do we expect to find an island no
one can find with a compass that
do not work

now lad just because it do not point
north do not mean it do not work
that compass give bearing to the isla
de Muerta wherever it may lie

really
so
what be the story on the
pistol

i will tell lee
now jack sparrow
have an honest streak in he and
that be where the whole problem
start
this be when he be
captain of the black pearl

what
he never told i that

ah he be learned then
play thing
more close to the vest
see jack be a
cartographer back in old england
somehow i he come by the money to
commission the pearl
hired himself a
crew promised each man an equal share
so they be forty day out and the
first mate say everything an equal
share that should mean the location of
the island too
so jack give up the
bearing
that night there be mutiny

jack give hisself up for the sake of
he loyal crewman
he be marooned on
an island left there to die

how do he get off the island

i do not

i body still there rot
away and i be but a ghost

how do you get off the island

ah that be a dark and unpleasant
tale best left untold

wait what about the pistol

the pistol
when a pirate be marooned
will he be given a pistol with a single
shot
no good for hunt or
surviving really
but after three
week of starvation and thirst the
option of that pistol begin to look
good

but i survive
and i still have
that single shot
it be mean for
one man
i mutinous first mate

Barbossa

moonrise captain
first night of full

hah
be mindful of pit and crevass
stay together

careful mate
fall down there you would
die and miss judgement day for not
even the lord himself come look for
you here

land
land
ho

ho

how do he do that

they will be anchore on the lee side
haul you wind and keep to the weather
of the island

the curse drive you to gather
this



aye
and not a bit of it any use
to we only hoard
but it will
drive we no longer

what be that

depend

on what

on whether the story be all
true
if they be that be a
waterfall that spill over at high
tide with a short drop to an
underground lagoon
if not

well too late

chalk one up for the story

here we stand before the curse
treasure of cortez himself
win by
blood it demand blood in return

what do you expect
we be all
gentleman here right and proper

you know the first thing i be going
to do after the curse be lift
eat a whole bushel of apple

what be begin by blood let blood
now end

jack this be not
something you have to do

i be sure
when you have lead the kind
of life i have there be debt
that must be paid
maybe i can
balance the scale a little

i invoke the right of parlay
accord to the code of the
brother set down by the pirate
morgan and bartholomew

i be incline to kill you now jack
sparrow without so much as a
word if you do not lose that grin
from you face

the woman blood do not work do

total of three day
last time
the rumrunners who used this
island as a cache come by and i
barter passage off

grand adventure of the infamous
jack sparrow

pirate to sail the spanish main

not just the spanish main
the whole
ocean

the whole world
wherever we
want to go we go
that be what a ship
be you know

hull and a deck and sail
that be what
a ship need
but what a ship be
what the black pearl reallyis
be
freedom

jack it must be so terrible for you
to be trapped here on this island all
over again

ah well
the company be good

to freedom

to the black pearl

what be you do

that signal be over a thousand foot
high which mean it can be see for
two hundred league in every direction
the entire royal navy be out to sea

even a chance they could mass it

you you burned up the island for a
onetime chance at be spotted

exactly

gun deck above yea

what happen to william turner

ah william turner
stupid blighter
he
threw in with we after we relieved jack
sparrow of he captaincy but turned
out it never sit well with he
particularly after we find cortes
treasure and it peculiar condition
he think we deserved to be curse
for leaving ol jack to the fate we
do
that be why he send off a piece of
the treasure to you as it be
so
it would never be recovered and so
cursed we remain

and then he run
and he be hide out
someplace where you have not be able
to find he

that be a nice thought to be sure and
i wager you da wish he would think it
hisself
but no
see what he would do
do not sit too well with captain
Barbossa
so he chain a cannon to
he leg and dump he over

yep last i see of bootstrap bill
be he face looking up as he
sink down to the crush black
oblivion of davy jones locker
it be only after we find out we
needed he blood to solve the curse
that be what you call ironic

bring he

you do not tell commodore norrington
everything

nor do you i notice

he might delay the rescue
and
that would be too late

exactly

these man will be facing an enemy
that seemingly cannot be killed

i have a plan
if it succeed then any
battle will be decidedly brief
and
onesided

what be you plan





elizabeth below deck
i will
not compromise you safety

lieutenant escort elizabeth to i
quarter and make sure she stay
there

i do not like the situation mister
sparrow
the island be riddle
with cave
i will not put i man
at a disadvantage

funny i be think along those line
how about you let i go in alone and
while you be setting up an ambush i will
trick the pirate out to you

you would do that

they left i strand
twice
what
have you get to lose

nothing i would not be please to be rid
of

i know you would listen to reason

that chart i draw up get you
past the reef
if you be
steersman good enough that be

i will be at the wheel myself

i will slip in talk they into to come
out and you will be free to blow holy
high heaven the whole lot of they

no reason to fret
it be just a prick of
the finger and a few drop of blood

turner blood do not flow pure in
he vein
best play it safe and spill it all

i guess there be a reason to fret

careful now
you could fall in and
still be wonder when you will hit dirt

you deserve to be curse and
remain curse

blast he
pox on he and he
father and the whole damnable
line
fan out
find he

drink i hearty yo ho
drink i
hearty yo ho

do you have any idea where you be
going

jack

do not talk
these cave magnify
sound
just follow i

be you certain this be the right way

it be the right way

thank you jack sparrow

you could not have lead he back
more directly if you know exactly
where you be going

you do know where you be going
you do lead we directly to they
why

what be begin by blood let blood now
end

you do not want to be do that

no i really think i do

all right then

why do not i want to do this

because right about now the


dauntless be lying in wait in the
harbor

jack

and it gun and crew will cut you
and you man to piece the moment you
step outside these cave

do you believe he

no
but he i believe
he be genuinely
angry

you have no hope of surviving
Norringtons attack
that be if
you be mortal

what be you suggest

simple
do not kill the boy yet
wait for a more opportune moment

drop the coin oneby
one back into the chest
like after you have killed
every
last
one
of Norringtons man

i can not help wonder jack why
you be be so helpful and all
last
time you do that it do not end
well for you

the situation have changed

that so

aye
see after you be do with the
royal navy you will have a bit of a
problem
the


dauntless
there
you will be with two lovely ship on
you hand and what to do
of course
you will decide you deserve the big
one and who be to argue
the dauntless
a firstrate shipofline and with it
you can rule the sea
but if you be captain of the dauntless
who be left for the black pearl

i sail for you as part of you fleet i
give you fifteen percent of i plunder
and you get to introduce yourself at
tea party and brothel as commodore
Barbossa

do we have an accord

now you can take care of the
dauntless right

man
be you up for it

mr
Pintel select five man to
stay here
take the rest of the
man out
not through the cave

there be
another exit

aye for we there be

ship rat
big one

hate those thing

taste all right though

that they do

be quick now
train the starboard gun
on the beach and set you aim
wait
for i signal we do not want to spook
they

which would you prefer first good
sir rum or wine

you do not mind and thank kind sir

all the man in place sir
ready to
fire

wait for i order what the blaze be
that

man

you have be planning this from the
begin
since you learned i name

oh please do i really seem that
clever

confound it jack i be
actually beginning to like you

steady man
remember we be the
navy

what be happening out there

they be on we side
take heart man

just so you know jack i do not
think you be that clever
i think
you be a fool
mortal fool

remarkable how often those two
trait coincide

you can not beat i jack

jack

well be not that interesting

they be so pretty i just could not
resist stealing one
it be a curse
i guess

so what now jack sparrow
be we
to be two immortal locked in
epic battle until the trumpet of
judgment day

or you could surrender

or i could chain you to a
cannonball and drop you in the
deep part of the ocean where
you can contemplate you folly
forever

hah
ten year you carry that
pistol and you end up wasting
you shot

he do not waste it

well you be the bad pirate i have ever
hear of
you be a man who can be trusted who
can be count on and who can it
betray he friend
what kind of pirate
be that

the bad
on the other hand maybe i be a man who
can not pass up a chance for revenge
against the blackhearted bastard who
steal i ship and left i to die in the
middle of the ocean twice
and
who know how to get what he want
now
that be a great pirate

let we get out of here

you be all right

miss swann be you wearing trousers
and how do you get off the island

yes i be wearing trousers
and as for
how we get off the island ah that be
a grand adventure but now be not the
time to talk about it

there
and do not you dare tell i
that be not a proper kiss

elizabeth i think it do not matter
that we be of a different class

it do not

but that be not a proper kiss

this be a proper kiss

tough luck
i be rooting for you

and though i do say so with
regret the law be clear
the
penalty for piracy be death by
hanging

by you leave i wish to speak on
behalf of the boy
it be clear that these deed be
perform out of a sincere desire to do
good at great personal risk
it seem
to i that in the rare occasion where
the right course be commit an act
of piracy then an act of piracy be the
right course
so in i capacity as governor i intend
to grant a pardon to

sir

jack and he crew have escaped
there be no damage to the cell
they must have be set free

the black pearl

sir
shall i break out the
cannon

i do not think that will be necessary

day head start
that be all he get

captain sparrow the black pearl
be yours

AnaMaria trim the mainsail

gibbs organize a clean detail

the pearl spicandspan and shipshape
