you see that girl in the gray dress
sitting over there

yeah

well the last time i be up here
that be where i sit
i sit there for
an hour and a half without moving a
muscle
now and then some fellow
would sort of walk up to i and then
change he mind
i will never forget
just sitting there for an hour and a
half with i hand in i lap
then i
begin to cry and i have to get up
and go home

i cry a lot too
i be a big cryer

this be something recent with i
this bursting into tear at the least
thing

oh i cry all the time any little
thing
i brother i brotherin
law they be always telling i what
a goodhearted guy i be
well you
do not get goodhearted by accident
you get kick around long enough
you get to be a real professor of
pain
i know exactly how you feel

now i figure two people get marry
and they going to live together forty

more than whether they be good looking

you tell i you think you be
not very goodlooking
i father be

talking and i used to adore i old
man because he be so kind
that be
one of the most beautiful thing i
have in i life the way i father
and mother be
and i father be a
real ugly man

old guy
he be a jewish feller
so
he said be you mother home

boy be i talking i never talk so
much in i life
usually everybody
come to i and tell i all they
trouble
well i be going to shut up
now and i be going to let you get a
word in

seventeen year ago
what i be
do with myself all that time
well i be talking again
i must be
driving you crazy
mosta the time
i be with a girl i can not find a word
to say
well i be going to shut up now
because i be not like this usually
usually i
well here i go again

i can not shut i mouth
i be on a
jag for Petes sake
you would think i
be loaded

i can not stop talking
be not this
stupid

you get to real nice face you know
it be really a nice face

thank you

so i be inna kneel position
and if you ever try shooting a
inna kneel position you know
what i mean
i can not holda steady
position
i be wavering back and
forth

so the guy next to i he be
shooting from the prone position
and he be crosseyed like i told you

so just then
stop to control
himself again
so just then i hear five shot go
off from the guy next to i

so i target go down and a minute
later the flag come up
i get five
bullseye
this crosseyed guy next
to i he shoot five bullseye into
i target

so i said to the sergeant who be
checking i score pretty good eh
sarge
five bullseye
so this
sergeant he do not know what happen
he say say that be all right
Pilletti

oh man
so that be what happen
that be how i get the reputationa
be the good shot inna whole
battalion
oh man

anything good in there mac

buncha dog

hey marty
hey marty you in here

when i get outta the army clara
i be lost
i do not know what i
wanted to do
i be twennyfive year
old what be i going to do go back to
i old job forty cent an hour
i
think maybe i go to college under
the
i
Biller right you know
but i would not graduate till i be
twennyeight twennynine year old
even if i make it in three year
and i brother freddie wanted to get
marry and i have three unmarried
sister in an italian home that be
a terrible thing
and i kid brother
nickie he be a one get marry last
week
so i just go to piece
i
used to walk inna street till three
four of the clock inna morning
i mother
used to be so worry about i
i
uncle mario come over one time
he
offered i a job driving he hack
onna night shift
he get he own
cab you know
and god forgive i
for what i be going to say now but i
used to thinka do away with myself
i used to stand sometimes in the
subway and god forgive i what i be
going to say i used to feel the
track sucking i down under the
wheel

yes i know

i be a catholic you know and even
to think about suicide be a terrible
sin

yes i know

so then mr
Gazzara he be a
frienda i father he offered i
this job in he butcher shop and
everybody plead with i to take
it
so that be what happen
i do not
want to be a butcher

there be nothing wrong with be a
butcher

well i would not call it an elegant
profession
it be in a low social
scale
people look down on butchers

i do not

well the point be mr
Gazzara wantsa
sell he shop now because he and
he wife be lonely and they want to
move out to california in los angeles
and live near they marry daughter
because she be always writing they to
come out there
so it be a nice little
shop
i handle he book for he so
i know he have a thirtyfive percent
markup which be not unreasonable
and he take home net maybe a hundred
hundred and fifty buck a week
the
point be of course you get to worry
about the supermarket
there be two
inna neighborhood now and there be
an coming in at least that be
the rumor
of course mosta he trade
be strictly italian but the young
italian girl they get marry and
they do not stick to the old italian
dish so much
i mean you get to
take that into account too

it be i feel that you really want
to buy this shop marty

that be true
i do
but i be going to
have to take outta loan inna bank
eight thousand dollar
that be a big
note to carry because i have to
give mr
Gazzara a mortgage and
what i have to weigh be
will it pay
off in the end more than i can make
onna salary

marty i know you for three hour
but i know you be a good butcher
you be an intelligent sensitive
decent man
i have a feel about
you like sometimes a kid come in to
see i for one reason or another
and some of these kid marty in i
class they have so much warmth in
they so much capacity
and that be
the feel i get about you

if you be one of i student i
would say go ahead and buy the
butcher shop
you be a good butcher


not quite trust
the timbre of he
voice
well there be a lotta thing i could
do with this shop
i could organize
i own supermarket
get a buncha
neighborhood merchant together
that be what a lotta they be do

Wadda you think

i think anything you want to do
you will do well

i be catholic
be you catholic

yes i be

i only get about three buck on i
now but i just live about eight
block from here on the other side
of webster avenue
why do not we walk
back to i house
i will run in pick
up some dough and let we step out
somewhere

i really should get home

it be only a quarter of twelve
the
clock right over there

i really should get home i told i
father
well i suppose a little
while longer
i wonder if there be
any place around here i could put
some makeup on

hey mac
