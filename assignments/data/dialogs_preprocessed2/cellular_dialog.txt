he lung
convulse trying to breathe burning like a thousand redhot
needle be pushing they way through he chest
the against the thick pylon below the pier

aim he weapon at the ocean daring ryan to surface

ryan finally make it to shore
coughing retching
he crawl
up the sand out of breath blood trail behind he
he unzip the waterproof pocket of he shorts pulling out
the cellphone which thank god be actually dry
ryan force
himself into action
stumble exhausted into a
the place be dark
empty
an array of rowing shell covered
in ghostly flap tarps make the place look vaguely haunted
this place be also filled with storage equipment such as
buoy and safety net used by the beach patrol

racing through the sand under the pier
he spot
ryans bloody footprint and follow they toward the
see tomlin coming
