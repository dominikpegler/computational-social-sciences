faith that rupert here would amount
to very much
but like he teacher

this fine young man
some say that
this misjudgment be directly tied to i
recent dismissal as head of the clifton
school system

opportunity to set the record straight
knowing that rupert and rita here be
most certainly destine for a great
career and a lifetime of happiness

only here add i own wish to those
of millions of viewer for they

to give you a glimpse into the future
it be not often that you can call
someone a sure thing in the entertainment
business
after all the verdict be

straighten he jacket a bit and trying to crane the
kink out of he neck
he be a bit tense but very high
and in full command
as he deliver he monologue
be more confident comfortable and selfassured than we
have ever see he

good evening lady and gentleman
let i introduce myself
i name be
rupert Pupkin
i be born in clifton
new jersey which be not at that
time a federal offense

be there anyone here from clifton
good
we can all relax
now i would like to begin by saying that
i parent be too poor to afford i
a childhood but the fact be nobody be
allow to be really poor in clifton
once you fall below eleven thousand
you be exiled to Passaic
i parent
do in fact put down the first two
payment on i childhood
then they
tried to return i to the hospital
as defective
but like everyone else
i grow up in large part thank to i
mother
if she be only here today
i would say hey mom
what be you
do here
you have be dead for
nine year
you should
have see i mother
she be wonderful
blonde beautiful intelligent
alcoholic
we used to
drink milk together after school
mine be homogenize
hers be loaded
once she be pick up for
speed
they clock she doing fifty
in we garage
when
they test she they find that she
alcohol be two per cent blood
they
take away she license and she die
shortly afterwards
we used to joke
together mom and i until the tear
would stream down she face and she would
throw up
and who would
clean it up
not dad
he be too
busy down at OGradys throwing up on
he own
in fact until i be sixteen
i think throwing up be a sign of
maturity
while the other kid be
off in the wood sneak cigarette i
be hide behind the house with i
finger down i throat

i never get anywhere until one day
i father caught i
just as he be
giving i a final kick in the stomach
for luck i manage to heave all
over he new shoe
that be it
i think
i have make it
i be
finally a man
as it
turned out that be the only time i
father ever paid any real attention
to i
he be usually too busy out
