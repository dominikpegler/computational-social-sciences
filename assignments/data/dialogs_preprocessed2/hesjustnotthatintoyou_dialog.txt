i have a theory about how this all
start

why do you do that

because you smell like dog poo

you be so stupid just like dog poo
you be make of poo

make
of
dog
poo

honey do you know why that little boy
do those thing
and said those thing

because he




uh excuse i but what the
where do that rumor start
because mom
have be spreading it for year

that little boy be do those terrible
thing because he



do you understand what this means
we
be all encourage to believe that if a
guy act like a total jerk that mean
he like you
sure that be a lesson that
might serve we as five year old but
many of we keep believe this advice
well into adulthood



then as we get old we carry on this
tradition of misread the signal man
send by encouraging we friend to do the
same

that phi delt so obviously liked you
i be sure he just lost you number

he be not asking you out because he be
intimidated by you professional success
and emotional maturity


here the problem
he like you
much
you be pretty and awesome
he
can not handle it

trust i
it be because he be just get
out of a serious relationship

trust i
it be because he be never have a
serious relationship

Shigerus inability to commit clearly
stem from he failure to properly
imprint on he mother during breast
feeding

i be sure he forget you hut number
or
do not get enough approval from his
father
or be eat by a giraffe



why do we say this stuff to each other
why do we tell each other these lie




be it possible that it be because we be
too scare and it be too hard to say the
one obvious truth that be stare everyone
in the face
he be

so janine told i you be a real estate
agent

yeah
but do not worry not one of the
cheesy one who put he headshot on bus
bench and grocery cart

so just like on frisbee and notepad

so you think it be great that they be
get marry but you never feel like
we be going against nature or something
by not get marry

no babe

go against nature be like that cat who
start nursing that monkey
we be just
two people who be not marry

right

i actually think the odds of have a
successful relationship increase by not
get marry
look at i parent
all marriage get they be thirty two
year of misery and joint checking

yeah i know
i get that

like i have always tell you i love you
and we do not need a marriage certificate
to legitimize we relationship

yeah

lemme get you some tea


so clearly he have not called

maybe he be away on business

he sell real estate
in baltimore
staying in town be he business

right

look let i tell you after the first
time i go out with ben he do not call
i for eleven day

and
now he be like the world good husband
that happen all the time

really

yes really

this be all you fault

what
why


you set i up with he

no you ask if i know any guy and i
give conor you number
that be not a set
up
when i do a set up i weigh pro
and con
i do i due diligence
all i
know about conor be he sell we this
house

he sold you a house in the ghetto

it be a neighborhood in transition


seriously stop

he said he always hang at red maple
after work
maybe i should do a little
driveby

please do not
he will call

caller be the bad thing that be ever
happen to i
total invasion of i
personal freedom
when a guy do not
call i it be i right i duty even
to call he and hang up several thousand
time
or at least until he mother
shout at i in albanian and blow a
police whistle into the phone
i mean
calling and hanging up be an age old
expression of love and frustration and
too many wine cooler and who be
ing to take that away from i


next thing you know someone be going to
ban i from sitting in i car in front of
a guy house blare where be you
heart by kelly clarkson until he new
stupid girlfriend come outside and
threaten to scratch i eye out with she
acrylic
i mean a girl deserve
freedom of expression right

at the begin

end
why do it matter

yeah
nice meeting you at the begin
of the date be normal
nice meet
you at the end could be a blow off

maybe it be at the begin

then that be fine
he be going to call


or maybe it be at the end
or maybe it
be nice to meet i

to meet you

shit

pretended to be work when i come in

janine how be the press release

beckon the bake to begin
mccormick
the flavor expert introduce five fun
fill flavor that will definitely
delight dessert diva

maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration
but otherwise good
where be we with the company newsletter

i be so almost do with that
it be just
be a little hard to focus on i article
about the two set of twin in market
research when the guy who may or may
not be the guy of i dream refuse to
call i


look after i first date with neil i
called he
there be no rule anymore
why should you have to wait for he to
get off he ass

into law school now than man and we do
well in those police simulation where
you can mistakenly shoot innocent people

dateline but woman practically have
penise now right

tacitcompliancebye

knock knock


hey

so
here we be
same shift again

i know
i make the schedule

i figure it be no coincidence

i have fun the other night

yeah
it be amazing where shot of
patron will get you

anyway i be think maybe tonight
after work
we could you know

look Kelli ann what happen between
we the other night be fun
but we be
way understaffed tonight i even have to
man the bar and that be why i schedule
you
to work
so

be we good here

no
we be good


dude

i know

be you joining we for dinner or

i be meeting someone
guy

ugh
why

hmmmm

nothing
sorry
for dinner

i be meeting someone

i believe you mention that


i be going to wait at the bar

that be a great idea

what can i get you

oh that be
i be meeting someone

oh yeah
get a hot date

i do not know if you would call it hot i
mean this guy conor and i have only be
out the one time so

wait conor barry

oh uhh yeah

Conors not coming in tonight
do he
forget he be suppose to meet you

see when i said meeting someone i guess
that be kind of a broad term kind of a
wide interpretation of the word meet

because i could just call he



i mean totally unnecessary
i
mean i actually be just in the area
so i figure i would just swing by and see if
he be around because uhhh

i uhh have to return his

pen
i have to return this pen
he
left this
so i think i should really
return it before he you know
freak out

dr
frankel adult child and geriatric
dentistry

look i be not going to judge about what may
or may not be important to someone

that be not even he dentist

oh really
then who be he dentist

i dad

i be gigi
conor and i go out last
week
and i just
i think if i run
into he
i do not know
i be going to go


hey
just hang out for a second
lemme buy you a drink

look you seem like a cool girl so i be
just going to be honest conor be never
going to call you

oh really
how do you know

because i be a guy
it be how we do it

he said it be nice meeting i

i do not care if he said you be his
favorite female since he mommy and
joanie cunningham
over a week go by
and he do not call

but maybe he called i and i do not get
the message
or maybe he lost i number
or be out of town or be hit by a cab
or he grandma die

or maybe he just do not call because he
have no interest in seeing you again

yeah but i friend terri once go out
with this guy who never called and she
totally write he off then like a year
later she run into he

you friend terris an idiot
and she be
the exception



but what if i be the exception

you be not
you be the rule
and the
rule be if a guy do not call you he
do not want to call you

really
always

yeah
always
i know what blow off a
woman look like
i do it early and i do
it often
trust i if a guy be
treat you like he do not give a shit
he do not
no exception

why be you telling i all of this
be not these mansecrets like why man
need to watch televise golf

i do not know
you look like you could
really use the help

thank you
you have given i a lot to
think about

everything

i be up all night

please say you be working on the
newsletter


sure
it be basically do
but this be
important

what be happening with you hair

please come in i office before the
other see that you have mini muffin
stick in you hair

i think i figure it out
remember when
i go out with that notary public
and
he cheated on i
and then anastasia
from upstairs told we that story about
how she boyfriend cheated on she at the
begin but then he totally changed
and they be marry and crazy in love

i think that guy be a process server

no notary
anyway the point be
anastasia be the exception
not the
rule
we have to stop listening to these
story because the rule be that most
guy who cheat on you up front do not
really care about you very much

okay

exhibit
chad the drummer who live
in he storage space
he only used i
for ride yet i continued to stalk he
for most of
then there be don
who broke up with i every friday so he
could have he weekend free
i be so
delusional about we relationship that i
referred to he as i husband to random
people like i dental hygenist


and all i friend would tell i story
about how thing might work out with
these dipshits because they know someone
who know someone who dated a dipshit just
like mine and that girl end up get
marry and living happily ever after
but that be the exception
and we be not
the exception we be the rule


so let i see if i understand
what
you be saying be that when people tell i
about some girl they know who dated a guy
for thirteen year and then he finally
married she that be the exception
and
the rule be that guy like neil who
be with girl like i for seven
year without get marry be never
get marry

no
no no no
that be not what i be
saying
this have absolutely nothing to
do with you
i be just talking you
know about i
specifically

it be impossible not to like this guy
i be pretty sure he be heavily flirt
with i outside eddy and then he
tell i he be marry
you would think i would
be pissed but i literally could not stop
myself from liking he

but he be marry

i realize that
i keep trying to force
myself to picture he in some church
saying vow to some woman and even that
do not cool it off
what be i problem



there be this guy who worked in i
dado printing business
married for
fifteen year to a nice lady
and then
he meet this woman at some church event
and he told i dad he just have never feel
anything like it before
i mean he have
finally meet the love of he life
so he
divorced he wife and he be be with
this other woman for year and they
be blissfully happy
i mean what if
you meet the love of you life but you
already marry someone else
be you
suppose to pass they by

you be right
i be calling he

hey ben
this be anna marks

do anna ever tell you i know tim
buckley

but
he have this big mop of hair and these
eye that just look past you and
through you and into you all at the same
time
complete interest and disinterest
it be amazing

of course i be with anna father at
the time so you know
another
opportunity missed

it be the truth
i know they all
robert
plant harry nilsson graham parsons
have you see the picture of i from
when i be anna age

sweetie go get that picture you know
the one

go
you mother asking you to do
something for she on she birthday

you will see we look strikingly similar
i lip may be a bit full but


wow
that be unbelievable

so that be what we be dealing with here
for reference
imagine meeting someone
who look like that in a coffee shop

that be funny because i mean i guess i
kinda do
anna and i meet at a
restaurant
that serve coffee
so not
a coffee shop but

if a girl be into you she be sleep
with you

month at the very outside she be not

glean from i own experience of

not call and treat you kind of bad and
keep you guessing and then convince you
that the anxiety and fear that it create
in you be actually a spark
and you
all buy it
you love it
you all thrive
on it because you all love drama

i do not

really
so you do not wait until the last
minute on deadline or on phone bill
because you love the drama of not knowing
whether you will make it

maybe

and let i guess when you be stalking
conor that night be you obsess
about he calling for day even though
the date be just kind of mediocre

implant

i need you to be honest with i javier
because i can not have someone lying to i

i mean there be no reason for that kind
of dishonesty be there

i

which
be like making promise to each other
right

she be holding out on you be not she

i be not sure i get you meaning

it be obvious
she will not sleep with you
it be written all over you puppy dog
face

it be killing i
literally
i be dying

here have a cookie

i just i have no idea what she be do
i cannot read she signal at all
we
used to sleep together all the time
well that be not true i do not know why i
said that it be not all the time
but
it do happen i know i be not making
this up
and then out of nowhere it
stop
but she still call she stop
by she sleep on i couch she want a
massage she leaf cute message but
it never go
i mean what be
she do


honestly we may not have the good
insight
gay signal have nothing to do
with straight signal

he be right
like here i want to
sleep with you

one two three that be it
three
second or more it be on

here i do not want to sleep with you


one two
no
thanks for playing
move along

it be that simple

you be right
that be no help at all

but listen i can tell you this
gay or
straight you be not going to get
anywhere by be inactive
she clearly
like you maybe she just want you to
be a man and do something
so the next
time you be in the position do not take
no for an answer

that sound like felonious advice

you be right
let i rephrase
do not
take maybe for an answer


wait
stop

what

shit
this be bad

what

i be so into you

i be lying here watch you and i
seriously have never feel this way
before
i have to forcibly make i brain
stop think about you
i mean all the
time

why stop

because i do not do stuff like this

stuff like what

like have sex with woman who be not i
wife

first of all i be not woman
i be just
one

what be second of all


i do not have a second of all

i think second of all be going to make
i feel good

second of all i can not stop think
about you either

i have to tell she

what

i have to tell she

i do not want to push you to

i want to be with you
and i can not do
that if i be lying to she

you know what be good

here the thing i daughter be happily
marry with kid and running a tanning
salon on staten island
but if she
be not i would tell she the same thing i would
like to tell a lot of the girl that come
in and out of this build on the arm of
a marry guy


and here be that advice get stock
cash annuity a deed in you name
do not settle for flower and a shop
spree at Bendels
think to the future
we all know that none of these guy be
going to leave he society wife and let she
keep half the money and the classic eight
on park avenue
so i want to tell these
young lady as long as you only have
the guy for a finite period of time
get something that can last
because i
guarantee you he will not
and that be the
good fatherly advice i can give

i be not picking out china pattern or
anything but i have never feel anything
like this before

this be crazy
i can not believe he be
going to leave he wife for you

no he be not leaving he wife for i
he be just he be a good guy
and he
can not really explore what we could be if
he be lying to she

he be kind of leaving he wife for i
be
this crazy
this be totally crazy
we
barely know each other

i do not know
remember becca i
sister friend
some guy wait on she
at Bennigans by the end of the night
they both know they have find the one

you be totally right
it can happen

not for i


well what about texter

Texter have yet to make any verbal
contact
i mean this guy could have have
surgery that left he without a voice
box breathe through a stoma and i would
never know because i never actually hear
he voice

i doubt he have a stoma

that be not the point
the point be i
can not text
i be not charming via text
i sarcasm do not come through i can not
type fast enough on the little phone
keyboard

so do not text

it be not just texting
it be email and
voicemail and snail mail

that be just mail

whatever
none of it be work
i have
have a guy leave a voicemail for i at
work and then i call he back at home
and he emails i to i blackberry and
then i text he to he cell and then he
emails i to i home account from the
plane phone and it just totally get
out of hand
i miss the day where you
have one phone number with one answering
machine that house one cassette tape and
either the cassette tape have a message
from the guy or it do not
that be it
now you have to go around checking all
you portal and get rejected by seven
different technology
it be exhaust

so what about the singer guy


jude

that be great

totally
i feel like we connected

hello
