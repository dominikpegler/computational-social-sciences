ferrie of new
orleans
after extensive questioning
and a thorough background check the
bureau find no evidence that

mr
ferrie know lee harvey oswald
or that he have have any connection
with the assassination of president
kennedy
the special agent in charge
would like to make clear that mr
ferrie be bring in for questioning
by the district attorney of orleans
parish not by the federal bureau of
investigation
the bureau regret
any trouble this may have cause mr
ferrie

in national news president johnson
have announced the creation of a blue
ribbon presidential commission to
probe the event in dallas

correct i if i be wrong
i think
we be on the same side
what the
hell business be it of theirs to say
that

pretty fast be not it
the way
they let he go

they must know something we do not
so let we get on with we live
gentleman
we get plenty of home
grow crime to prosecute

the commission will be headed by
chief justice of the united states
supreme court earl warren and be
expected to head off several
congressional and texas inquiry
into the assassination
on the panel
be allen dulles exchief of the
representative gerald ford
john
mccloy former head of chase
manhattan bank

that be a mess down there jim
we have
bitten off more vietnam that we
can possibly chew

sad thing be the way it be screw
up this country all these hippy
running around on drug the way
young people look you can not tell a
boy from a girl anymore
i see a
girl the other day she be pregnant
you could see she whole belly and
you know what she painted on it
love child

control
Valuesve go to hell
jim

get somebody like that polecat johnson
in the white house

i sometimes feel thing go
downhill since john kennedy be
killed senator

those
warren commission fellow be pickin
gnat shit out of pepper
no one
going to tell i that kid do the
shoot job he do from that damn
bookstore

i think the testfired the
rifle to make sure it could be do

sure three expert and not one of
they could do it
they be telling
we oswald get off three shot with
worldclass precision from a manual
bolt action rifle in less than six
second and accordin to he marine
buddy he get Maggies drawer he
be not any good
average man would
be lucky to get two shot off and i
tell you the first shot would always
be the good
here the third shotes
perfect
do not make sense
and
then they get that crazy bullet
zigzag all over the place so it
hit kennedy and connally seven time
one pristine bullet
that dog
do not hunt

you know something always bothered
i about that from day one and i
can not put i finger on it

if i be investigatin i would round
up the good rifleman in the world
and find out which one be in dallas

decoy

birch society minuteman slightly
to the right of attila the hun
used to recruit college student to
infiltrate radical organization on
campus
all out of this office
now come around here take a look at
this

camp street
same build as
lafayette right
but different
address and different entrance both
going to the same place the office
on the second and third floor

guess who used this address

see this
what the hell be this
do on this piece of paper
asshole



i god
lee harvey oswald



bullseye
how do we know he be
here
because this office address be
stamped on the proCasto leaflet he
be hand out in the summer of
down on canal street
they be the
same leaflet that be find in his
garage in dallas

he be arrested that day for fight
with some antiCastro cuban
but
actually he have contact they a few
day early as an exMarine trying
to join the antiCastro crusade
when they hear he be now proCastro
they paid he a visit

he be a traitor this man
do not
believe a word he tell you
you sonofabitch you liar you be a
communist go back to moscow

okay carlos if you want to hit i

there be no real fight and the
arrest lieutenant later said he
feel it be a stage incident
in
jail oswald ask to talk to special
agent john quigley of the who
show up immediately
they have a
private session
oswald be released
and quigley destroy he note from
the interview

but the arrest get he a lot of
publicity and as a result oswald
appear on a local debate that
established he credentials as a
communist

but you be a communist be you not
and you defect to russia

no i be not a communist
but i be
a MarxistLeninist

what do you do when you be in
russia

i worked while i be there
i be
always under the protection of
that be to say i be not under the
protection of the you

government

what the hello a communist like lee
oswald do work out of
banister

ever hear of a double agent bill
i be beginning to doubt oswald be
ever a communist
after the arrest
camp street never appear on
the pamphlet again
now here
another one for you
what would you
say if i told you lee oswald have
be trained in the russian language
when he be a marine

i would say he be probably get
intelligence train

lou you be in the marine
who
would be running that train

the office of naval intelligence

take a look across the street

post office

upstairs
in that be the office
of naval intelligence and just by
coincidence banister before he be
be
what do they say

once always

well he like to work near he old
pal

bill lou we be standing in the
heart of the united states
government intelligence community
in new orleans
that be the there
the secret service
do not
this seem to you a rather strange
place for a communist to spend his
spare time

what be you driving at boss

we be going back into the case lou
the murder of the president
i want
you to take some money from the fee
and fine account and go to dallas
talk to some people
bill i want
you to get Oser on the medical the
autopsy susan on oswald and ruby
history tax record

lord wake i please
i must be
dreaming

no you be awake bill and i be dead
serious
and we be going to start
by tracking down you anonymous source
from three year ago
how do you
find out dave ferrie drive to texas
that day

you be not under crossexamination
here jack

here i problem jack
you told
i you and guy be good friend for
a long time

more than ten year

and he never hit you before

never touched i

yet on november the day
of the president murder we police
report say he pistolwhipped you
with a
magnum
martins eye be
fixed on jim
but the police report say you have
an argument over the phone bill
here take a look at it
martin look at the
report
now do a simple argument over
phone bill sound like a believable
explanation to you

shaking he head
slowly dreamily
no it involve more than that

how much more

i do not know if i should talk about
this

well i would ask guy we be friendly
you know heart attack be not it

if you buy what you read in the paper

you have other information

i do not say that
all i know be he
die suddenly just before the warren
report come out

why do guy beat you jack

well i guess now that guys dead
it do not really matter
it be
about the people hanging around the
office that summer
i be not really
part of the operation you know
i
be handling the privateeye work
for guy when that come in not much
do but that be why i be there
it be a nuthouse
there be all
these cuban coming and going
they
all look alike to i

dave ferrie you know about he



be he there often



often
he practically live there
it be real cloak and dagger stuff
they called it operation mongoose
the idea be to train all these cuban
exile for another invasion of cuba
banister office be part of a supply
line that run from dallas through
new orleans to miami stockpile
arm and explosive



all this right under the nose of
the intelligence community in
lafayette square



sure
everybody know everybody
it
be a network
they be working
for the pilot black operation
guy civilian military everybody
in those day be running gun
somewhere
fort jefferson bayou
bluff morgan city
mcallen texas
be a big gunrunning operation



where be banister in all this



banister be running he camp north
of lake pontchartrain
ferrie handle
a lot of the train
there be a
shoot range and a lot of tropical
terrain like in cuba
few american
get trained too
nazi type
mercenary
but ferrie be the
crazy

anyway late summer the party end
kennedy do not want another bay of
pig mess so he ordered the to
shut down the camp and confiscate
the napalm and the
there be
a buncha cuban and a couple american
arrested only you do not read about
it in the paper
just the weapon
get mention
because the first
one behind bar would have be
banister and ferrie but i think the
Gmen be just going through the
motion for washington
they heart
be with they old buddy
banister

like i said a fuckin nuthouse

and oswald

yeah he be there too
sometimes
he would be meeting with banister with
the door shut
other time he would be
shooting the bull with ferrie
but
he be there all right

anything more specific jack
it be
important



yeah one time the secretary get
upset i remember

i can not believe it mr
banister
lee oswald be down on canal street
giving out communist leaflet
support castro

it be okay delphine he be with we

anyone else involved at banister
level

there be one guy i do not know big
guy business guy white hair i
see he come into the office once
he look out of place know
like a society guy
can not remember

kiss anybodies ass sure kiss his

clay something that be he name

when something rotten in the land
bill it generally be not just one
fish we will get corroboration

budget and in secret be going to
solve the case that the warren
commission with dozens of support
staff and millions of dollar could not
solve
we can not keep up with the
crime in the parish as it be chief

the murder of a president bill be
a crime in orleans parish too
i
do not pick you because of you legal

who the hell be they then
hi
susie sit down
this could be it
let we start looking
for they

graveyard dead
august this year
single car accident on an empty
road in midlothian texas
the doctor
said he be in some kind of strange
shock when he die

we need to find more witness lou

there be rose Cheramie
whore
two cuban threw she out of a car on
the way to dallas

can we find she

graveyard dead near big sandy texas

highway
hit and run

why not go right to the horse mouth
chief

if we go to he we investigation
hit the front page by sunrise
blow up right in we face
ruby be
just given a new trial
if he have
something to say it will be there
susie what do you find out on
oswald

negative on he tax record
classify
first time i know a


can not get a tax record
i put
together a list of all the file
on oswald that be part of the warren
report and ask for they
there
be about document
give it to jim who
read
oswald in the in mexico city
oswald and the a personnel
file a memo from the director on
oswald travel and activity can not
get one of they
all classified as
secret on the ground of national
security
it be real strange

maybe there be more to this susie
the cias keeping something from we
enemy

yes but we be talking about a dead
warehouse employee of no political
significance
three year later and
he be still classified
they give we
he grammar school record a study
of he pubic hair
put it in
context bill of what we know about
oswald
lonely kid no father
unstable childhood high school
dropout want to grow up and be a
spy join the marine at
he
learn russian he act overtly
marxist with two other marine but
he be station at a top secret base
in japan where spy flight over
russia originate
he be discharge
from the marine supposedly because
he mother sick
he stay home
day then with a ticket from
a bank account he go to
moscow

i want to renounce i citizenship
and become a soviet citizen
i be
going to make known to they all
information i have concerning the
marine corps and i specialty therein
radar operation



one of the consul john McVickar
say Oswalds performance be not
spontaneous it seem coach
oswald give an interview to a
journalist

i will never return to the united
state for any reason
it be a
capitalist country an exploitive
racist country
i be a marxist since
i be
i have see poor nigger
and that be a real lesson
people
hate because they be tell to hate
like school kid
it be the fashion
to hate people in the you




the russian be skeptical want to
send he back
maybe they suspect
he be a spy
he supposedly slash
he wrist in a suicide attempt so
that they be forced to keep he and
he disappear for six week
presumably with the

finally they shuttle he to a radio
factory in minks where he life as
high on the hog as he ever have
he be given ruble a roomy
apartment with a balcony have affair
with local girl

make sense he be a spokesman

but he never write speak or do
any propaganda for the russian
he
meet marina whose uncle be a colonel
in soviet intelligence at a trade
union dance
she think he be russian
the way he speak six week later
they marry have a daughter

do not someone say he do not speak
good russian

it be a contradiction numa get used
to they
the only explanation for
the royal treatment be he do give
they radar secret
or fake secret



i do not know if it be coincidence
but oswald have a top security
clearance and know about the
program from he day at Atsugi air
base in japan
six month after he
arrive in russia francis gary
power spy flight go down in
russia
that plane be untouchable
power hint that oswald could have
given the russian enough data to
hit it
as a direct result the
peace summit between khrushchev and
eisenhower failed
i can not help
think of that book seven day in
may maybe someone in we military
do not want the peace conference to
happen maybe oswald be part of
that
it get weirde

susie you be an assistant


remember
stick to what you can
prove in court

you want fact bill
okay
from
to only two you

soldier
defect to russia
from to
seven defect six return one of
they another marine a month before
oswald
all of they young man make
to seem poor disenchanted

do not get sidetrack
how do he
get back to the states
that be the
point
do he have any problem

none
the state department issue
he a new passport in hour and
loan he the money to travel
he be
never investigate or charged by the
navy for revealing classify
information or as far as we know
debrief by the

this be a man whose secret because we
to change we radar pattern in the
pacific
he should have be prosecute
as a traitor

the finally get around to talking
to he in dallas and run a file on
he as a miscreant communist type

but who meet he when he get off
the boat in new york in june



spa
Raikin a lead member of
an antiCommunist group



and marina
do she have a problem
get out



none either
it be bizarre
it be
next to impossible to get russian
sweetheart out
nor do lee have
any problem get a new passport
when he want to go to cuba and russia
in
man who have defect once
already
it be crazy

dammit it do not add up
ordinary
people get blacklist for leftist
affiliation
the state department
do everything short of dispatch
a destroyer to minks to insure
Oswalds return
only intelligence
people can come and go like that



the next thing we know he be live
in DallasFt
worth in october
work month at JaggarsChiles
Stovall a photographic firm that
contract to make map for the you

army
he start work only day
before the government reveal russian
missile in cuba and the crisis
explode
oswald may have have access
to missile site footage obtain by
the plane and works alongside a
young man who be in the army
security agency

sort of like benedict arnold coming
back to george washingtons cabinet

equally incongruous be oswald becoming
chummy with the white russian
community of dallas all rabid anti
communist

he close friend be an oilman named
george de Mohrenschildt who be about
year old than oswald who be
only and supposedly broke
de
Mohrenschildt be a member of the
dallas petroleum club speak five
language and be in french vichy
intelligence during the war
also
rumour to have be a nazi
sympathizer and member of the
Solidarists an international anti
communist organization with many
eastern european and exNazis many
of they bring here by the after
the war many of they involve in
oil and munition interest in dallas
and the southwest
you figure it

where do you get all this nazi stuff

read it
they called it project
paperclip




this be the guy that keep turning
up in colonial country and each
time something strange happen
coup detats president overthrow
he show up on a walk tour of
Guatemalas cuban invasion camp
just before the bay of pig invasion
if we do not know he be let we
circle he very probable Oswalds
handler

i think he be make some mistake on
cuba but he be do a pretty good
job
if he succeed in i opinion
he will be a great president
and a
really attractive one too open
feature great head of hair



de Mohrenschildt draw a picture of
oswald as an intellectual well read
speak excellent russian a man who
adore



that be scenery
do not get
sidetrack
this be the man bottom
line who nail oswald to the warren
commission as a potentially violent
man and linked he to the rifle

so lee what be you taking a potshot
at this week rabbit or fascist

the only russian that suspect oswald
of still be a communist be anna
Meller
but she russian friend tell
she he be check with the local
and be tell oswald be all right

the Oswalds be introduced by george
de Mohrenschildt to janet and bill
williams
it be through janet williams
in october that lee get the
warehouse job right smack on elm
street at the book depository which
be owned by another oilman with tie
to defense and military intelligence



presumably so he can now exercise
he intellect stacking school text
at
an hour



all i can find out about the williams
be they tax return be classified
and that bill williams a descendant
of the Cabots of massachusetts have
link through he family and unite
fruit to the and do classify
work for bell helicopter which
require a security clearance so
what be oswald a defector do
visiting he wife in he house
williams have a relationship at bell
with general walter Dornberger
another one of the nazi we bring
in after the war for we missile
program
he used slave labor to
build the rocket for hitler
before bell needed he

i wonder about the williams
just
where do the first description of
oswald come from at

no one
know
they claimed it be brennans
but he description come after


who called
somehow the FBIs
be tapping the williams and pick
up a call between bell helicopter
and janets phone an unidentified
voice saying we both know who be
responsible
who called
why be
the bureau be tapping they



he wife janet williams studied
russian in college and she father
work for the agency for
international development which
works hand in hand with the
she suddenly become marinas best
friend
marina fight often with
lee about many thing he secrecy
the lack of money
she say lee be
not sexually adequate
lee hit she
on several occasion
bill williams
convenient separation from janet
allow janet to invite marina to
move into she house in irving
there
marina and lee have a second daughter
while lee now store his
belongings in janets garage and
rent a small room in dallas under
an alias of

lee

when he be arrested marina bury
he with the public
she description
of he be that of a psychotic and
violent man

i do not want to believe but i have
too much fact
tell i that lee
shoot kennedy



yeah after they take she to six
flag inn in arlington prepare she
for the interview teach she how
she should answer and after two
month and interview she have a
nervous breakdown
oswald be no angel that be clear
but who be he

i be lose boss
what be we saying
here

we be saying that when oswald go
to russia he be not a real defector
that he be an intelligence agent on
some kind of mission for we
government and he remain one till
the day he die that be what we be
saying

and therefore because oswald pulled
the trigger the intelligence
community murdered they own commander
in chief
that be what you be saying

i will go you one well
maybe oswald
do not even pull the trigger bill
the nitrate test indicate he do not
even fire a rifle on november nd
and on top of that they do not even
bother to check if the rifle have
be fired that day

he have he palm print on the weapon

it go to the goddamn and they
do not find a goddamn thing
it
come back a week later and one guy
in the dallas police department
suddenly find a palm print which
for all i know he could have taken off
oswald at the morgue
there be no
chain of evidence bill
and what
about the tow gun actually see in
the depository
one an enfield
photograph by a newsman and the
other a mauser described by deputy
weitzman
maybe just maybe lee
oswald be exactly what he said he
be bill a patsy
take it at
face value
lou susie i be going
with i gut here
he be get an alias
of Hidell to buy the rifle

lee to rent the room right
what be
in a name right
in intelligence
they be assumed to be fake
name
be sort of like a postbox number a
code several different people can
use the same name right
then why
can not somebody be use Oswalds
name

but why

to frame he obviously
you get to
get in you mind how the hell spook
think bill
they be not ordinary
crook

i never could figure out why this
guy order a traceable weapon to
that post office box when you can go
into any store in texas give a phony
name and walk out with a cheap rifle
which can never be trace

unless he or someone else want he
to get catch
maybe he never ordered
the weapon lou
somebody else do
it be pick up at the post office
early morning when Oswalds time
sheet show he clock in at his
job
lou come alive
these thing
be not add up

i still have to question what the
legal basis be that support this
boss
Susies stuff be colorful
but

let we start making some assumption
about the man
why would he leave a
path as big as lee harvey Oswalds
this be not a thin trail gentleman
it be a very wide one
who find
the evidence
who set he up
lou
bill susie i want you to go back
and check all the sighting of oswald
in dallas new orleans and mexico in
the summer and fall of see if
it be the same guy

boss oswald impersonator
sound
like james bond now

al you can not tell a mink from a
coonskin unless you see the fur up
close
goddamn sam
if we do not
start reading between the line here
you all get to start think on a
different level like the do
we be through the look glass
here white be black and black be
white

what do you think lou

i be just an investigator bill
i
leave the theory to you lawyer

you numa

week ago i would have say this be
nut but now
there be a lot of smoke there but
there be some fire

now you guy come on
you be talking
about the united states government
here

we be talking about a crime bill

second

tell the truth here
in dallas
that there be people here who do
not want i to tell the truth
who do not want i to have a retrial

that sumbitch be killed
because he
be a communist
put i on the stand
go ahead i will tell the same goddamn
story i be proud of it do not matter
fuck all to i thing do not change

you hunch be right boss but it be
even spookier than we think
starting in september on two
month before the assassination
there be sighting of oswald all
over dallas buying ammunition
get a telescopic sight fixed
going to rifle range
early
november a dallas downtown lincoln
mercury dealership where he tell
the salesman albert Bogard


hey i get a lotta money coming in
the next two week



despite the fact he have no license
and from what marina say do not
know how to drive he hit the curve
like mario andretti at the indy
Bogard later told he boss he drive
like a madman


three hundred buck down mr
oswald
you can drive outta here with it

who you kidding
for this heap
forget it
no honest work man
can afford a car anymore in the
goddamn country
maybe i will have to
go back to russia to buy a car



really dumb dialogue like he be
trying to draw attention to himself
real moron
he walk out
the
salesman remember he as about
but we know from he draft card he
be about

several witness see he on
several separate day at different
fire range

one time november he decide
he need to practice on the target
of the guy next to he
say
something really dumb to the guy
who say oswald be a great shot

hey watcha doing boy
that be i
target

hey sorry buddy
i just think
it be that sonofabitch kennedy
know
i could not help myself

about as subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug

i will go you one well lou
he
show up at silvia Odios a cuban
lady in dallas working in the anti
castro underground remember that
name a solid witness
the two cuban
introduce he as leon oswald

the cuban want silvia whose
parent be political prisoner in
cuba to help they raise money to
assassinate castro
something about
the man bother she
she tell they
she do not want anything to do with
violence
about hour later one
of the cuban call she back

on the phone in
spanish
this guy leon Oswalds great he be
kinda nut
he told we we do not
any guts we cuban because kennedy
should have be whacked after the bay
of pig and some cuban should have
do that it be easy to do he say
you know he be a marine an expert
shooter

it be like he be giving she information
she do not even ask for
she be
scare do not see they again till
she see Oswalds picture in the
paper
but the warren commission
say she have bad eyesight because
they have oswald in mexico at this
time trying to get back into cuba
the cuban think he be a double agent
so they will not take he
the have
a camera outside the cuban embassy
and say this be oswald in mexico
you figure it

if this be oswald it must be we
third oswald

the interesting thing be the extent
to which the warren commission go
to make he a communist
they get
almost page and exhibit of
the report on this mexico trip and
the picture do not even match
i be
beginning to think the point of the
mexican episode be to lay the blame
at Castros door
if oswald or
someone purport to be oswald have
get into cuba come back then
killed the president the american
public once again would have scream
for a cuban invasion

i even have doubt about this photo
boss
it pretty much convicted oswald
in the public mind
well accord
to captain fritz oswald told he
during he interrogation the photo
be fake

that be not i

it come from janet williams garage

well i never see that picture
it
be i face but i face have be
superimposed the rest of the

mr
garrison what can i do for you
on easter sunday

i be sorry mr
shaw to interrupt
this holiday but i feel this be a
conversation we might well have
out of the everyday bustle in this
office

i be not sure i understand

bringing some paper
forward
well
in an investigation we be
conducting you name have come up a
number of time

i would not imagine where

we recently talk to a number of
man who claim to know you
be you
acquaint with a david logan

no
never hear of he

perry russo

no

willie OKeefe

no i do not believe i know anyone by
that name

mr
OKeefe told we he meet you at
the masquerade bar down in the quarter
and several evening later you have
he over for dinner at you apartment
on dauphine street
do you recall
that



of course not
i do not know this
man
obviously then i would not
have he to dinner
incidentally i
do not live in an apartment
it be
an s house build by gallier
i have restored it faithfully
you
know i be quite an advocate of
restoration



perhaps a few more detail about the
evening will refresh you memory
mr
OKeefe told we dinner be serve
by a uniformed waiter a colored
man
he particularly remember that
you sit at one end and he at the
other which he find rather unusual
because the table be so long
do
that bring back memory of willie
OKeefe

not at all
but on the other hand
i do have a lovely chippendale dine
table and i often have a friend over
sitting at one end while i sit at
the other
that be precisely the
point of a long dine table
the
splendor of the meal add to the
enjoyment of it

i would imagine a uniformed waiter
help

it add a taste of elegance for which
i must confess a weakness for now
and then
i call he smedley
he
real name be frankie jenkins but i
could hardly imagine anything more
uncouth during dinner than i turn
toward the kitchen and hollering
frankie

where be this lead
to mr
garrison



after dinner you paid he to have
sex with you



Pffft
absolute nonsense
the
quarter be filled with vivid
imagination i dear mr
garrison
grimy young hoodlum who will say and
do anything
as you well know



in the course of that night mr
OKeefe said a man named david ferrie
stopped by the house
along with
another young man



who



david ferrie



no
i have never known anyone by
that name
of course never have
meet mr
OKeefe i could hardly have
meet mr
ferrie

a profusion of bailbonding company
why be that

nettle by miller

shooter standing behind the picket
fence
we

i know about that shot
terrible
tragedy
put the photo back
on the desk
how much do you have for carrying on
you investigation

how many man be working with you on
this

less than you would guess
most
day two to three assistant

s
handful of police investigator

that be all you have have all this time

that be it

i admire you mr
garrison
how do
you manage to make you way into guy
banister operation

that be never in he newspaper mr
miller

i be going to be very frank with you
you have do a great job an astounding
job considering the limit resource
available to you
but the good you
can ever hope for be to stir up a
lot of confusion
you be not going
to do this country any good and
you be not going to do yourself any
good
he sit back down
and look directly
at jim
you do not belong here
on this mickey
mouse street with that cheap strip
of bail bond shop

you should be in a job
where you can make decision that
have impact affect the world
here
you be trying to climb up the steep
side of mount everest

i propose you accept an appointment
to the bench in federal district
court and move into a job worthy of
you talent
he lean back and
pause
do you have any idea do you have
any conception of how easily such an
appointment can be arranged

and what would i have to do

stop you investigation
it be a
magnificent effort but it be over and
do with
the press be already on
you behind and that be only the
beginning i boy only the begin

how long do you think it would take
i to be appointed

smile think
jim be hook
well ordinarily these thing take a
long time
but in you case with
you record it can be expedit
easily
i guarantee it

who be you mr
miller
no answer just the
sound of the overhead
fan
you see that helmet over there
the nazi helmet with
a bullet hole on his
desk
i picked that up at the dachau
concentration camp when we liberate
it in
it be the most
horrifying sight i have ever see mr
miller
pyramid of decay
stink bone and skin one on top
of the other
i do not enjoy looking
at that swastika every day mr
miller but i keep it there to remind
i of what can happen when a country
turn from free democratic principle
to fascism when a few madman turn
human being into digit and millions
sit in silence and do nothing about
it

mr
miller you and i have meet under
a great misunderstand
i have not
the remote interest in becoming a
federal judge
and nothing be going
to keep i from going ahead with i
investigation of john kennedys
murder

bill mr
miller and i have finished
we conversation
would you show

and you turned it down
you know
what be coming next do not you boss

boss i tell you something or somebody
be putting tremendous heat on david

i instinct be that ferrie be going
to keep on deteriorate and we will
end up get more out of he when
he finally crack
if we call he
now he might freeze up and we could
lose the good shot we have ever have

down any far
we get to protect
he full time

rise look at his
watch

heart
attack maybe an aneurysm
look
like natural cause

it be addressed to no one and no
signature
to leave this life be
for i a sweet prospect
i find
nothing in it that be desirable and
on the other hand everything that
be loathsome


pretty flowery for dave ferrie

jim hand lou the medicine bottle

Proloid

i take it once for a low thyroid
condition
it raise the metabolism lou
do david ferrie strike you as the
kind of person who have a low
metabolism

i would say the opposite hypertension

ferrie be the only one to express
some kind of remorse about this whole
thing
i think it get he killed

boss we just get bad news from miami
they find ferry cuban friend
Eladio del valle this morning
hack to death with a machete in

all i get in return in
the end be a kick in the tooth


jesus they must have be hard pressed
to come up with that one

give the coroner
the empty bottle
nick what would happen if a man
suffering from hypertension be to
take an entire bottle of Proloid

he would die pretty quick either a heart
storm or a ruptured blood vessel in
the brain

can you ascertain if there be Proloid
in he system

not in a routine autopsy but if we
look at the spinal fluid there
might be a high level of iodine but
it be difficult to know
whatcha
thinkin jim

well it do not make sense nick
he be afraid of dying then he kill
himself in a way that leaf no trace
but he leaf two unsigned suicide
note

i have already be warn by the
agency mr
whoever

garrison
and i assume if you have come this
far what i have to say interest
you
but i be not going to name name
or tell you who or what i represent
except to say you be close you be
closer than you think

everything i be going to tell you be
classify top secret
i be a soldier mr
garrison
two
war
i be one of those secret
guy in the pentagon that supply
the military hardware the plane
bullet rifle for what we call
black operation black op
assassination coup detats rig
election propoganda psych warfare
and so forth
world war rumania
greece yugoslavia i helped take
the nazi intelligence apparatus out
to help we fight the communist
italy stealing election france
breaking strike we overthrew
Quirino in the philippines arbenz
in guatemala mossadegh in iran
vietnam in indonesia tibet
we get the dalai lama out we
be good very good
then we get
into the cuban thing
not so good
set up all the base for the invasion
suppose to take place in october

khrushchev send the missile
to resist the invasion kennedy
refuse to invade and we be standing
out there with we dick in the wind
lot of pissedoff people mr
garrison you understand
i will come
to that later
i spent much of
september working on the kennedy
plan for get all you

personnel
out of vietnam by the end of
this plan be one of the strong
and most important paper issued
from the kennedy white house
we
first troop be ordered home
for christmas
tension be high
in november one week after the
murder of vietnamese president diem
in saigon and two week before the
assassination of we president

a strange thing happen
i be
send by i superior officer call
he to the south pole as the
military escort for a group of
international vip
this trip have
nothing to do with i nine year of
work in special operation
it be
sort of a pay vacation

it be not until i be on i way back
in new zealand that i read of the
president murder
that be in
the afternoon the next day new zealand
time but already the paper have the
entire history of an unknown year
old man oswald a studio picture
detail biographical data russian
information and be pretty sure
of the fact he would killed the president
alone although it take they four
more hour to charge he with the
murder in texas
it feel as if
well a cover story be be put
out like we would in a black op

anyway after i come back i ask
myself why be i the chief of special
op selected to travel to the south
pole at that time to do a job that
any number of other could have do
one of i routine duty if i have
be in washington would have be to
arrange for additional security in
texas
the secret service be
relatively small and by custom the
military will augment they
i checked
it out when i get back and sure
enough i find out someone have tell
the th military intelligence group
at th army headquarters at fort sam
houston to stand down that day
over the protest of the unit
commander a colonel reich

now this be significant because it
be standard operate procedure
especially in a known hostile city
like dallas to supplement the secret
service
even if we have not allow
the bubbletop to be remove from the
limousine we would have put at least
to agent on the sidewalk
without question
there would already
be several attempt on de Gaulles
life in france
only a month before
in dallas ambassador adlai
stevenson have be spit on and hit
we would have arrive day ahead of time
studied the route checked all the
building
we never would have allow all those
wideopen empty window overlook
Dealey
never
we would have
have we own sniper covering the
area
the moment a window go up
they would have be on the radio
we
would have be watch the crowd
package rolled up newspaper a
coat over an arm never would have
let a man open an umbrella along the
way never would have allow that
limousine to slow down to mile
per hour much less take that unusual
curve at houston and elm
you would
have feel an army presence in the
street that day but none of this
happen
it be a violation of the
most basic protection code we have
and it be the good indication of a
massive plot in dallas
who could
have best do that
people in i
business mr
garrison
people like
i superior officer could have tell
col
reich look we have another
unit coming from so and so provide
security
you will stand down
that
day in fact there be some
individual army intelligence people
in dallas and i be still trying to
figure out who and why
but they
be not protecting the client
one
of they by the way be catch in
the book depository after police
sealed it off

army Intell have a harvey lee oswald
on file but all those file have
be destroyed
many strange thing
be happening that day and lee
harvey oswald have nothing to do with
they
we have the entire cabinet on
a trip to the far east
we have a
third of a combat division returning
from germany in the air above the
united states at the time of the
shoot and at


the
entire telephone system go dead in
washington for a solid hour and on
the plane back to washington word
be radioe from the white house
situation room to lyndon johnson
that one individual perform the
assassination
do that sound like
a bunch of coincidence to you mr
garrison
not for one moment
the
cabinet be out of the country to
get they perception out of the way
the troop be in the air for
possible riot control
the phone
do not work to keep the wrong story
from spreading if anything go wrong
with the plan
nothing be left to
chance
i bet you there be even
backup team and car on the other
side of the underpass in the event
that kennedy get through wound
they would have moved in with vehicle
like they do with de gaulle
he
could not be allow to escape alive

i never though thing be the same
after that
vietnam start for
real
there be an air of i do not
know makebelieve in the pentagon
and the
those of we who be
in secret op since the begin
know the warren commission be
fiction but there be something
deeper ugly
and i know allen
dulles very well
i brief he
many a time in he house
he be
also general ys benefactor
but
for the life of i i still can not
figure out why dulles be appointed
to investigate kennedys death
the
man who have fired he
i get out in

i retired from the you

air
force

i never realized kennedy be so
dangerous to the establishment
be
that why

that be the real question be not it
why
the how be just scenery
for the sucker
oswald ruby
cuba mafia it keep people guessing
like a parlor game but it prevent
they from asking the most important
question why
why be kennedy
killed
who benefit
who have
the power to cover it up
you
know in right after the bay of
pig very few people know about
this i participate in draw up
national security action memo
and
these be crucial
document classified top secret
but basically in they kennedy
instruct general Lemnitzer chairman
of the joint chief that from here
on forward

the joint chief of staff would
be wholly responsible for all covert
paramilitary action in peacetime
this basically end the reign of
the splinter it as


promised he would into a thousand
piece and now be ordering the
military to help
this be
unprecedented
i can not tell you the
shock wave this send along the
corridor of power in washington
this and of course firing allen
dulles richard bissell and general
charles Cabell all of they sacred
cow of Intell since world war
you get some very upset people here

kennedys directive be never really
implement because of bureaucratic
resistance but one of the result
be that the cuban operation be
turned over to i department as
operation mongoose which mean
that people like i superior officer
general take over the cuban
personnel that be be trained to
invade cuba and the base like the
train camp at pontchartrain in
you home state that be closed
down by kennedy
and that be how
the black op people people like
general end up taking the rule
of covert warfare they would used abroad
and bring into this country
now they have the people the
equipment base and the motivation
check out an old man bill harvey
run something called executive
action which carry out foreign
assassination
harvey be also
involved with the fake defection
program that get oswald into russia
check out the Cabell brother
interesting link to this case

do not underestimate the budget
cut kennedy called for in march of
either close to military
installation in state
overseas base you be talking big
money
you know how many helicopter
have be lost in vietnam
about
three thousand so far
who make
they
bell helicopter
who own
bell
bell be near bankruptcy when
the first national bank of boston
approach the about developing
the helicopter for indochina usage
how about the f fighter
general
dynamics in fort worth
who own
that
find out the defense budget
since the war begin
going on a
hundred billion
billion
be spent before it end
in it
be billion
no war no money
sometimes i think the organizing
principle of any society be for war
the authority of the state over it be
people reside in it be war power
even eisenhower military hero of
warn we about it
beware
the military industrial complex
he said
kennedy wanted to end the
cold war in he second term
he
wanted to call of the moon race in
favor of cooperation with the soviet
he signed a treaty with the soviet
to ban nuclear test he refused
to invade cuba in and he set
out to withdraw from vietnam
but
that all end on november

only four day after


be shoot
lyndon johnson signed national
security memo which essentially
reversed kennedys new withdrawal
policy and give the green light to
the covert operation against north
vietnam that provoke the gulf of
tonkin incident
in that document
lay the vietnam war

i do not
i can not believe it
they
killed he because he wanted to change
thing
in we time in we country

king be killed mr
garrison
politics be power nothing more
but do not believe i
do not trust
i
do you own work you own
think

the size of this be
beyond i
testify

no chance in hell mr
garrison
i would be arrested and gagged declared
insane and hospitalized
maybe
badly
you too
i can only give
you background you get to find the
foreground the little thing
keep digging
know you be the
only person to ever bring a trial in
the murder of john kennedy
that be
important it be historic

i have not yet
i do not have much of
a case

but you do not have a choice anymore
you have become a significant threat
to the national security structure
they would have killed you already
but you get a lot of light on you
instead they be going to destroy you
credibility
they already have in
many circle in this town
you be
some kinda egocrazed southern
caricature to many folk
be honest
the good chance you get be come up
with a case something anything
make arrest stir the shitstorm
you get to hope to reach a point of
critical mass where other people
will come forward and the government
will crack
remember fundamentally
people be sucker for the truth
and the truth be on you side bubba
i hope you get a break

mr

with conspiracy and enter into an
agreement with other person for the
specific purpose of commit the
crime of murder of president john
kennedy in violation of

shaw what do you have to say

yes mr
shaw be included in we
investigation and there be no
connection find at all between shaw
and the president assassin

if mr
shaw have no connection to the
assassination why do the
investigate he
and why if they
do be he name not mention once
in the entire volume of the warren
report even it if be to clear his
name
i doubt this attorney general
would qualify for i staff

no i do not think so
mr
garrison
have presented absolutely nothing
publicly to contradict we finding
as yet i have not hear one fact to
refute the commission determination
that lee oswald be the lone killer

i congratulate mr
shaw
most
witness have to wait for trial
before they be allow to produce
sacred cow like the chief justice
of the land as a character witness
who be of course not under oath and
free from the law of perjury

mr
garrison if what you say be
even partly true in this case you
realize you be damaging the
credibility of we government
possibly destroy it

let i ask you
be a government
worth preserving when it lie to the
people
it have become a dangerous
country sir when you can not trust
anyone anymore when you can not tell
the truth
i say let justice be
do though the heaven fall

in the sheriff report mrs
mercer
it say you be at Dealey plaza two
hour before the assassination but
that

yes it be about in the morning
i be driving west on elm street
toward the triple underpass in a
rent car a blue valiant
i will
never forget that day

there be quite a bit of traffic
and i be stopped alongside a green
pickup truck
it be very noticeable
because it be block traffic and
it be park with two wheel on the
curb
when i see the gun i think
the secret service be not very secret

the next morning saturday i go
to the office and the agent
show i photograph

i picked out three picture that
look generally like the driver of
the truck and then

that be the man

jack ruby

what about these other
you said
they might be he

they look a little like he
but
no
holding up the ruby
photo
i be sure this be the man

you mean you identify he on
saturday the day before ruby shot
oswald

that be right
when i see he on
i be shock
i said to i family
that be the man i see in the truck


but you do not seem nearly so sure
in you statement to the warren
commission

that be what bother i mr
garrison
you see they have be altered
i
statement

this say mercer could not identify
any of the photograph as be
identical with the person she have
observed slouch over the wheel of
a green ford pickup truck
that be
not true
i recognized he and i
told they so
they also said it
be a dark green air conditioning
truck which it be not
and here
she go to another
report
on the dallas sheriff report
this be really strange
see that
notarized signature on the bottom of
each page
that be not i signature
and there never be any notary present
during any of i questioning
she hand the paper
back to jim
i guess that be all

mrs
mercer as a former man
it be difficult to accept this

i know but mr
garrison the be
just not do they job

i be a republican mr
garrison and
i do not go in for this kind of
government bash but i must tell
you something not right when they
do not even bother to call julia in
front of the warren commission

they do not call a lot of people
mr
mercer
i think it be safe to
say the warren report be a work of
fiction

beverly tell mr
garrison about the
carousel club



oh yes i used to go over there a
lot to see jack and especially i
friend Jada who dance there
it
be the real swing spot in town
everybody come
businessman
politician from austin lyndon
johnsons friend
dallas be a
slow town back then
you chewed
toothpick play dominos spit and
date policeman
but jacks be
exciting
there be always cop
there
jack liked they around but
he used to throw the drunk out
himself because he be kinda a violent
temper man
it seem everybody
in those day know jack be with the
mob
the cop be bad back then
they would shake you down for the money
in you pocket
they put a lotta
people in the cemetery especially
colored people

beverly what about lee



oh yeah
one time i come in jack
introduce i to these two guy
he
said beverly this be i friend
lee
and i do not catch the other
guy name
he be a weirdlooking
guy with those funny little eyebrow
the other guy lee do not make much
of an impression either
he be not
goodlooking or nuthin he do not
look like he have any money and he
be in a bad mood so i do not pay
he much mind
well i might not
remember a name but i always remember
a face
when i see he tow week
later on the television i scream
oh i god that be he
that be
jack friend
i know right then
it have something to do with the
mafia
well about a week later
after she told the newspaper she would
meet this guy lee with jack Jada
disappear off the face of the
earth



never know what happen to she till
herman offered to sell i she
wardrobe
i said but Jadas coming
back and i remember the way he
smile
and i know she be never
coming back

will you testify beverly

i do not think so sir

i think when we come here we have
an agreement

i just do not want to become another
statistic like she
if they can
kill the president do you think
they be going to think twice about a
twobit showgirl like i

we could call you in beverly

i know the pressure you be under
beverly
do not think i do not
i understand



yes sir right here on this spot
the shot come from near that wooden
fence over there near the overpass

i see a man run from this spot and
go behind the book depository
minute later i give this information
to the sheriff

i make it very clear to the warren
people one of the shot come from
behind that picket fence
i hear
the report and see the smoke come
out about or foot above the
ground right out from under those
tree
there be no doubt whatsoever
in i mind

we all four of we all railroad
man standing here see about the
same thing
the smoke come from
behind the hedge and a motorcycle
policeman drop he cycle in the
street and run up the embankment

we come around here to look for
track
it rain that morning and
we find a bunch of cigarette butt
Someoned be standing about here

this be a good spot chief for the
head shot

i be standing here next to i friend
mary Mooman who take the photograph
when he be killed

i jump out in the street and yell
hey mr
president look over here
we want to take you picture
he
look up and then shot ring out
mary fell to the ground right away
shouting get down they be shooting
get down they be shooting
i know
it but i be moving to get closer to
he
the driver have stopped i
do not know what be wrong with that
driver
and then out of the corner
of i eye i see this flash of light
in the bush and that last shot
just ripped he head off i mean
blood brain just blow everything

i look up and see smoke from the
knoll
and everything be frozen
seem like people be not even
breathing like you be looking at a
picture except this one guy
i
see this one guy running from the
book depository towards the railroad
track
and that be the same man i
see on two day later shooting
oswald
that be jack ruby
no
question about it

it be he i be chasing up the grassy
knoll think we guy have shoot
back and maybe we get one of they
i do not know what i would have do
if i have catch he but i know
something terrible have happen and
somebody have to do something

i never do catch he
all i see in
that park area be railroad
worker and dallas fine

secret service madam
you be coming
with we

oh no i be not
i do not know you
we get to catch this shooter do not
you realize

grab she other
shoulder
i said you be coming with we
i
want the picture in you pocket



he put a hurt on i but good

i do not have any picture
i have
to go back and find i friend mary
lemme alone

hush
just smile and keep walking



these new people never identified
themselves
they musta be watch
the whole thing because they know
everything mary and i have be do
that day
i guess i be not too hard
to find wearing that red raincoat

how many shot you say you hear

four to six

that be impossible
you hear echo
echo
we have three bullet
and three shot which come from the
book depository and that be all we be
will to say



which be strange because this be
less than minute after the
assassination

no i see a guy shooting from over
there
he be behind that fence
what be you going to do about it

we have that taken care of
you
only hear three shot and you be
not to talk to anyone about this
no one you hear



i be scare
it be all kinda queer
but it sure feel like two and two
be coming up three
and then they
take marys five snapshot from i
send they to washington and when
they return they week later two
of they have the background
mutilate
the only one we saved
be in marys camera
i do not want
to go to washington when the warren
commission subpoena i
so the
lawyer come down here and interview
i at parkland hospital

he ask i why i think i be in
danger and i said

well if they can kill the president
they can certainly get i

that do not make sense mrs
hill
we have the man that killed the
president

no you do not

he keep trying to get i to change
i story about the shot
he be
get hot under the collar and
telling the woman not to write when
he wanted

look do you want the truth or just
what you want i to say

i want the truth

the truth be that i hear between
four and six shot
i be not going
to lie for you

you hear echo

no
i have gun all i life
i used
to go turtle shoot

i realize you be under a great deal
of stress
it be cloud you
judgement



so off the record he start talking
about i family and even mention
i marriage be in trouble like i
do not know it or something
he get
angry and angry and then

look we can put you in a mental
institution
we can make you look
crazy marguerite oswald and
everybody know how crazy she be



i know something be crook as a
doge hind leg because no one who be
just taking a deposition get that
involve and angry
sure enough
when i finally read i testimony as
published by the warren commission
it be a fabrication from start to
finish

be you will to testify mrs
hill

damned right i would
Somebodys
get to tell the truth around here
because the government sure be not
do it

the Zapruder film establish shot
in
second
here
i be oswald
time i

go

time

between six and seven second

the key be the second and third shot
come right on top of each other and
it take a minimum
second to
recycle this thing
he recycle the bolt
for fire
the other problem be there be a
tree right there
blocking the first two shot at the
time they occur in the Zapruder film

do not hoover say something about
that
the leave have fallen off in
november

it be a texas live oak boss
it shed it be leaf the first week
of march
you try to hit a move
target at yard through heavy
foliage with this cheap dollar
sucker the world bad shoulder
weapon
no way
the tried two
set of test and not one of they
sharpshooter could match Oswalds
performance
not one
and oswald
be at good a medium shot
the scope
be defective on it too
i mean
this be the whole essence of the
case to i
the guy could not do the
shoot
nobody could
and they
sell this lemon to the american
public

the Zapruder film be the proof they
do not count on lou
we get to get
we hand on it

that mean we get to subpoena time
life on it

why not just shoot kennedy coming up
houston
there be plenty of time
he be out in the open a frontal
shot

i ask myself the same thing
common
sense
even if you miss the first
shoot if he accelerate you still
get he for a second shot
no
the only reason for waiting to get
he on elm be you get he in a
triangulated crossfire
you get he
on a flat low trajectory from the
front at the fence there

you put a third team there in
that build on a low floor

when kennedy get to the kill zone
it be a turkey shoot

how many man

one shooter
one spotter on a radio
maybe three team
i would say these
be professional rifleman chief
serious people
hunter
patient
it take skill to kill with a rifle
that be why there be be no execution
of an executive with one in
year

green

he tap jim on the
shoulder
or else abort
abort


main street over there the
original parade route on the way to
the trade mart
too far right
impossible shot

so they changed the route to bring
it this way

who do you think changed the parade
route

beat i
city official
secret
service
dallas police
they do a
dry run with chief curry a few day
before
but they do not bother
running through Dealey
they stopped
right there said something like
and afterwards there be only the
freeway and go home

you know who the mayor be

no

earle Cabell
and guess who he
brother be

who

general charles Cabell
deputy
director of the
fire by kennedy
in because of the bay of pig
fiasco he moved back to the pentagon
called kennedy a traitor
when he
come to new orleans to address the
foreign policy association you know
who introduce he
we friend clay
shaw

the warren commission call he

he boss be the one on the warren
commission who handle all the lead
to the intelligence community

allen dulles

head of the since
kennedy
fired they both
Cabell be he
deputy for nine year
talk about the fox investigating the
chicken coop
now we will have to
subpoena they lou

they be going to love you chief

maybe we should just call it a day
lou
go home
while we be still a
little behind
we get two people
killed maybe more we never think
about

you never get anyone killed boss
they action killed they year
before
if we stopped now it would be
even more wrong

subpoena they lou dulles the
Cabells TimeLife
the whole damned
lot of they

the you

attorney in washington
decline to serve we subpoena on
allen dulles charles Cabell
director richard helms or any
agent we named

well what do you expect from a pig
but a grunt

without they it be going to be near
impossible chief to prove shaws
connection to the
we get the
same problem with the governor
all of they
reagan in california
will not give we brading ohio refuse
orville townsend texas on Arcacha
and nebraska on sandra Moffet

what the hell be going on
never
before have an extradition request
from this office be refuse

we have not tried to get julia anne
mercer in

no she could get hurt
if you
believe what be happening to these
other people

she be the good damn witness we have

i just do not want to do it
what
else

hate mail here
fan mail here
the
bad news be the have just requested
an audit on you income from this
office

i expect that two month ago and
they be wasting they time
the
bad news be the national guard have
just ask i to resign after
year
well maybe that be good news it
be never as good as combat but
this be
bill any more on oswald
and shaw

yeah
they be see together in
clinton in early september
the
civil right movement be running a
voter registration drive

rumor be shaw a local boy be
working on some arm deal to discredit
the civil right movement
no one
really know what they be do
there but everyone sure see they
they stand out like cottonballs
i
get white and black see they but
last time i checked there be nothing
illegal with register to vote
we still get the negro junkie vernon
bundy see they talkin at the seawall
near lake pontchartrain
but it be
tough boss no one want to talk
about shaw
he be

you know you keep saying that

keep saying what

you be not digging

i think clinton be a breakthrough
shaw deny he know ferrie or oswald
be that right
it prove he be a
liar
keep on it bill

this be interesting be you ready
for this
oswald go to see the
two week before the
assassination
it seem special
agent Hosty make three routine visit
to he house supposedly to keep an
eye on marina oswald

i want to see special agent Hosty

i be sorry he be not in
can someone
else help you

can i use a pen



he left a note
Hosty told a dallas
newspaperman it be a warn to he
to stop questioning marina at they
home when oswald be not present
she be not a citizen so possibly
he be threatening to deport she
back to russia

but what the note really said no one
know because he boss shanklin told
Hosty

Oswalds dead now
there be no trial
get rid of it
i do not even want
this in the office
get rid of it
Hosty
he give it back to
Hosty



Hosty tear it up and flushed it down
the toilet
waggoner carr the
attorney general of texas say he
have evidence from the dallas sheriff
office that oswald have be employed
as an undercover informant for the
at a salary of a month
beginning more than a year before
the murder

this be just speculation people
but what if the note be describe
the assassination attempt on


the staff seem
surprise by the
thought
come on guy think that be the
only reason to destroy it because
if it be any kind of threat like
Hosty said they would have keep it
because it make they case against
the angry lone nut strong
remember the new orleans meet
with agent quigley the day he get
bust

there again quigley destroyed the
note of the meet
i think we
can raise the possibility that oswald
not only be an informant but that
he may well have be the original
source for the telex we have dated
november warn of the kennedy
assassination in dallas on november


william walter the night clerk on
duty here in the office give i
a copy of this
it go all over
the country
nothing be do and
the motorcade go ahead on schedule
and this be not even mention in
the warren report
read it al



threat to assassinate president
kennedy in dallas texas november

information received by the
bureau have determined that a militant
revolutionary group may attempt to
assassinate president kennedy on he
propose trip to dallas texas etc
etc




shortly after the assassination
walter say the telex be remove
from all the file in all city as
an obvious embarrassment to the
bureau
i believe oswald be sending
information through Hosty

i have a hunch that from the get go
oswald have infiltrate this group
probably cuban or rightwing
extremist
he be at the book
depository that day told to be there
by they handler either to prevent
the assassination or to take part in
it
they coulda told he anything
either they be going to close
down the plotter that day or
they be going to fake an attack on
kennedy to whip up public opinion
against russia or cuba and reverse
he policy it do not really
matter what they told he because he
be under order he be a foot
soldier

to the two young
cuban
i can get you in and up there
this
be a shot out the southeast window
of the sixth floor
that floor will
be unoccupied between noon and one

what about the elevator

i can close it off
the only access
be a stairwell

we get they in as an aircondition
unit

no
floor refurbishing group
get the van the uniform

if we can get the motorcade to
turn from main onto houston that
do the trick because it will slow down
to make the turn here
you can not
miss
to the two young
cuban
he be a dead duck

i do not buy it chief why would
the cover it up
you be talking
the whole here
telex that
disappear from every single
office in the country

there be a word order

or a cover up
jesus bill do not
you have enough proof of the FBIs
complicity now

maybe i have a little more respect
for this country institution than
you do susie
you tell i how the
hell you can keep a conspiracy going
between the mob the and
army intelligence and who know what
else when you know you can not even
keep a secret in this room between
people
we get leak everywhere
we be going to trial here
what the
hell do we really get
oswald ruby
banister ferrie be dead
shaw
maybe he be an agent i do not know
but as a covert operator in i book
he be wide open for blackmail because
of he homosexuality

shaw we toehold bill
i do not
know exactly what he be where he
fit and i do not care
i do know
he be lying through he tooth and i be
not going to let go of he

so for those reason you be going
to trial against clay shaw chief
well you be going to lose
we should
be investigating all we mafia lead
here in new orleans carlos marcello
santos Trafficante i can buy that
a hell of a lot easy than the
government
Rubys all mob know
oswald set he up
hoffa
Trafficante marcello they hire
some gun and they do kennedy and
maybe the government do not want to
open up a whole can worm there
because it used the mob to get to
castro
know castro be
assassinate sound pretty wild to
john
citizen
so they close the
book on


it make sense to
i

i do not doubt they involvement
bill but at a low level
could the
mob change the parade route bill
or eliminate the protection for the
president
could the mob send oswald
to russia and get he back
could
the mob get the the and
the dallas police to make a mess of
the investigation
could the mob
appoint the warren commission to
cover it up
could the mob wreck
the autopsy
could the mob influence
the national media to go to sleep
and since when have the mob used
anything but
s for hit up close
the mob would not have the guts or
the power for something of this
magnitude
assassin need payroll
order time schedule
this be
a militarystyle ambush from start
to finish
a coup detat with lyndon
johnson waiting in the wing

oh now you be saying lyndon johnson
be involved
the president of the
united states

i know this bill lyndon johnson
get billion for he texas friend
brown and root to dredge cam ranh
bay for the military in vietnam
that be just for opener

boss be you calling the president
a murderer

if i be so far from the truth why be
the bug we office
why
be we witness be buy off
and murdered
why be federal
agency block we extradition
and subpoena when we be never
blocked before

maybe because there be some rogue
element in the government

with a fullblown conspiracy to cover
it up
ever read you shakespeare
bill

yeah

julius caesar
brutus and cassius
they too be honorable man
who
killed caesar
twenty twentyfive
senator

to prove that mob boy like barding
and jack ruby play ball in right
field with hunt oil

i do not trust the guy

gentleman i will not hear this
i
value bill as much as anyone here
we all need to make room for someone
else idea lou especially i
maybe oswald be what everyone say

i just plain do not trust he anymore

maybe you do not hear what i said
i will not tolerate this infighting
among the staff i warn you that

boss then i be afraid i can not continue
working with bill

first we have you charge that the
cuban exile killed the president
then the mob then you said the oil
billionaire do it then you said
the minuteman and the ku klux klan
collaborate to do it now you late
theory seem to be that the and
the and the pentagon and the
white house all combined in some
elaborate conspiracy to kill john
kennedy
let i ask you be there
anyone besides lee harvey oswald who
you think do not conspire to kill
the president

how many hour do i have to answer
that one
well let we just say this
jerry i have stopped beating i wife
or maybe you should ask lyndon
johnson
we know he have some answer

there have be a number of report
in reputable news media time
newsweek we own that you
have go way beyond the legal means
available to a prosecutor that you have
intimidate and drug witness
bribe they urge they to commit
perjury
what be you response

you faith in the veracity of the
major media be touching jerry
it
indicate that the age of innocence
be not yet over
but seriously
jerry people be not interest in
jim garrison they want the hard
evidence
they want to know why he
be killed and what force be
opposed to

some people would say you be paranoid

well if i be why be the government
conceal evidence

be they
why would they

pulling out he
briefcase
that be exactly i question jerry
maybe i would well show you some
picture so you can begin to
understand what i be talking about

these arrest be photograph
minute after the assassination and
be never show to the american
public
they show

picture like this do not show up on
television

holding the picture
up again
sure they do
the camera can pick
this up

no it can not

quickly realize
he be about to be cut
off
those man you just see be arrested
in dallas minute after the
assassination
they be never see
again
no record of arrest no
fingerprint no mugshot nothing
they all get away

we will be back after these message

jim bad news
bill turned boss
i think he be given everything we have
get to the feds

we studied the memo there be
nothing there chief nothing
when
we go to confront he the landlady
said that sonofabitch just take off
left everything

i be sorry

i know

i be sorry

something sure scare he

bill do not scare that easy
somebody get to he think
he
be never that good a thinker

much be at stake tonight in
california
public opinion poll
show senator robert kennedy of new
york lead senator eugene mccarthy
of minnesota
they antiVietnam
war message be obviously striking a
chord with the voter and whoever
win tonight will certainly emerge
as the favorite over VicePresident
humphrey to win the nomination in
chicago in august
that man now
seem to be senator kennedy

sure sound like he be win

he will never make it
if he win
they will kill he
he want to avenge
he brother
he will stop that war
no they will kill he before they let
he become president

boss with broussard they have
everything
all we witness we
strategy for the trial
we would have
to doublecheck all he work there
could be false lead
we get to
rethink this trial

i do not think so al
you remember
the hemingway story the old man
and the sea
the old fisherman manage to catch
this great fish a fish so huge he
have to tie it to the side of the
boat to get it back in
but by the
time he reach shore the fish have
long since be pick apart by shark
and nothing be left but the skeleton

then what be we going through all
this trouble for

it be a means to an end
this war
have two front in the court of
law we hope against the odds to
nail clay shaw on a conspiracy charge
in the court of public opinion it
could take another or year
for the truth to come out but at
least we be going to strike the first
blow

and if you be wrong

i never doubt for a second that i
be
will you come to the trial elizabeth

i do not think so jim

with of the precinct report
senator kennedy continue to hold a
lead of to over senator
mccarthy
news have projected
senator robert kennedy the winner of
the crucial california primary

and that be what have be going
on within the united states over the
last three year the division the
violence the disenchantment whether
it be between black and white
between poor and the more affluent
or between age group or the war in
vietnam we can start to work
together
we be a great country
an unselfish country and a
compassionate country
i intend to
make that i basis for running






they killed he honey

huh

he win
and they killed robert
kennedy
they shoot he down

oh no
no
i can not believe it
i
can not believe it
both of they
both brother oh i god

you be right it have not end have
it

i wish i could have loved you more
i feel sometimes like i do not ever
love you or the child enough
i be sorry

that be clay bertrand
that be the
man i see at david ferry

that be who you say you see
a
confess homosexual convict of
solicitation pander
a man who
have lie about most everything who

it be that man there yessir
he
be at the pontchartrain wall with
the man who shoot the president
i
remember he because o he limp there

heroin addict inject himself
at the wall barely conscious

that be the man there
he drop
oswald off on the voter line
i
remember because they be the only
white stranger around that morning
that big black cadillac of he make
i think they might be

said he be a representative of
one international trade mart in new
orleans

more than five year ago for two
minute
it be fair to say you could
be mistaken be not it

figment of i imagination
the
cates stewing i the oyster
shucking i i told he you get the
right atat but the wrong ohoh
bertrand be not shaw scout honor
and you can tell he i said so

objection you honor
this office
have win a conviction of perjury
against dean andrews on this matter

exception taken
that case be on
appeal

mr
goldberg you claim you meet david
ferrie and clay shaw while on a
vacation here from you account
business in new york you have drink
and under the influence discuss
killing kennedy be that not so

i do

why

well i wanted to make sure she be
the same girl i send

i see
and why be you experience
this paranoia

launching into his
explanation
well you see i have be subject to
hypnosis and psychological warfare
ever since when i be in
korea

he be one of Broussards witness
chief
i be sorry
he be totally
sane when we take he affidavit

but how do dymond know what to
ask

we be dead

when someone try to get you
attention catch you eye that be
a clue right off

you honor i call police officer
Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand

i be going to have to ask the jury to
leave the courtroom

what

i be sorry jim but the defendant
do not have he lawyer present when
ask

any alias

clay bertrand



jesus ed from time immemorial it be
be standard book procedure to
ask an alias
you know that
there be
no constitutional requirement that
say a lawyer have to be present for
routine question

i call as i see jim
i be
ruling it inadmissible

that be we case

if that be you case you do not have
a case
i would not believe whatever
Habighorst said anyway

i can not believe you be saying this
in the courtroom

well i be saying it
bring in the
jury

we be filing for a writ to the
appellate court

you do that

oswald

no i do not

ever called dean andrews

no i do not

and have you ever meet david ferrie

with a smirk of
amusement
no i would not even know what he
look like except for the picture
i have be show

do you ever use the alias clay
bertrand

no i do not

thank you
mr
shaw

well a very great actor have just
given we a great performance you
honor but we be nowhere close to
the truth
let it be noted i office
be charging clay shaw with outright
perjury on the fifteen answer he
have given not one word of this

you be out of order jim boy now
sit down
strike those remark

to prove they be a conspiracy
involve clay shaw we must prove
there be more than one man involve
in the assassination
to do that
we must look at the Zapruder film
which i office have subpoena
the
american public have not see that
film because it have be keep lock
in a vault in the TimeLife build
in new york city for the last five
year
there be a reason for that
watch

picture speak a thousand word
yet sometimes the truth be too simple
for some
the warren commission
think they have an open and shut
case
three bullet one assassin
but two thing happen that make it
virtually impossible
the Zapruder
film which you just see and the
third wound man jim Tague who
be nicked by a fragment down by the
triple underpass
the time frame of

second established by the
Zapruder film left no possibility of
a fourth shot from Oswalds rifle
but the shot or fragment that left a
superficial wound on Tagues cheek
have to come from a bullet that missed
the car entirely
now they have two
bullet that hit and we know one of
they be the fatal head shot
so a
single bullet remain to account
for all seven wound in kennedy and
connally
but rather than admit to
a conspiracy or investigate far
the commission choose to endorse the
theory put forth by an ambitious
junior counsellor arlen specter
one of the gross lie ever forced
on the american people we have come
to know it as the magic bullet
theory

the magic bullet enter the
president back headed downward at
an angle of degree
it then
move upward in order to leave
kennedys body from the front of he
neck he neck wound number two
where it wait
second turn
right and continue into Connallys
body at the rear of he right armpit
wound number three
then the bullet
head downward at an angle of
degree shattering Connallys fifth
rib and leaving from the right side
of he chest wound four and five
the bullet continue downward and
then enter Connallys right wrist
wound number six shattering the
radius bone
it then enter his
leave thigh wound number seven
from which it later fall out and be
find in almost pristine condition
on a stretcher in a corridor of
parkland hospital
he show a mockup
of the pristine
bullet
that be some bullet
anyone who be
be in combat can tell you never in
the history of gunfire have there
be a bullet like this
the army wound ballistics expert at
Edgewood arsenal fired some comparison
bullet and not one of they look
anything like this one
he show mockups of
comparison bullet
take a look at an identical
bullet fired through the wrist of a
human cadaver just one of the bone
smashed by the magic bullet
yet
the government say it can prove
this with some fancy physics in a
nuclear laboratory
of course they
can
theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff
with it be tail tied to a daisy but
use you eye you common sense
seven wound skin bone
this single
bullet explanation be the foundation
of the warren commission claim of
a lone assassin
and once you
conclude the magic bullet could not
create all seven of those wound
you have to conclude there be a
fourth shot and a second rifleman
and if there be a second rifleman
there have to be a conspiracy which
we believe involved the accuse clay
shaw
Fiftyone witness gentleman
of the jury think they hear shot
coming from the grassy knoll which
be to the right and front of the
president

key witness that day charles
Brehm a combat vet right behind
jeans hill and mary Moorman

holland and richard dodd on the
overpass

price overlook the
whole plaza randolph carr a
steelworker who serve in the rangers
in north africa william newman
father of two child who hit the
deck on the north side of elm abraham
Zapruder james simmons each of
these witness have no doubt
whatsoever one or more shot come
from behind the picket fence
twenty
six train medical personnel at
parkland hospital see with they own
eye the back of the president
head blasted out

a large cm opening in the right
occipitoparietal area a considerable
portion of the brain be miss
there
he gesture to his
head

almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter
of the back of the head this area
here
he indicate his
head
have be blasted out along with
the brain tissue there
the exit
hole in the rear of he head be
about mm
across
there be
also a large piece of skull attached
to a flap of skin in the right
temporal area



not one of the civilian doctor who
examine the president at parkland
hospital regard he throat wound
as anything but a wound of entry
the doctor find no wound of entry
in the back of the head
but the
body be then illegally moved to
washington for the autopsy

texas law sir require the autopsy
be do here
you be not taking he
with you

sonofabitch you be not telling i
what to do
get the hell outta the
way



because when a coup detat have
occur there be a big difference
between an autopsy perform by
civilian doctor and one by military
doctor working for the government



the departure of air force one from
love field that friday afternoon be
not so much a takeoff as it be a
getaway with the newly sworn in
president



objection you honor

sustained



on the plane of course lee harvey
Oswalds guilt be announced by the
white house situation room to the
passenger before any kind of
investigation have start
the lone
nut solution be in place



objection
you honor

sustained
mr
garrison would you
please bottle the acid

the three bethesda naval hospital
doctor picked by the military left
something to be desire inasmuch as
none of they have experience with
combat gunfire wound
through they
autopsy we have be able to justify
eight wound three to kennedy
five to connally from just two
bullet one of these bullet the
magic bullet

colonel finck be you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck

i be tell that the family wanted
examination of the head

as a pathologist it be you
obligation to explore all possible
cause of death be it not

i have the because of death

you honor i would ask you to direct
the witness to answer i question
why do colonel finck not dissect
the track of the bullet wind in the
neck

well i hear dr
humes state that
he said

who be in charge here

i be



i do not remember he name
you must
understand it be quite crowd and
when you be called in circumstance
like that to look at the wound of
the president who be dead you do not
look around too much to ask people
for they name and who they be



but you be a qualify pathologist
be this army general a qualify
pathologist



no



but you take he order
he be
directing the autopsy



no because there be other
there
be admiral



there be admiral



oh yes there be admiral and
when you be a lieutenant colonel in
the army you just follow order and
at the end of the autopsy we be
specifically tell as i recall it
be admiral kenney the surgeon
general of the navy we be
specifically tell not to discuss the
case

gentleman what you have see in this
room be intensely private to the
kennedy family and it be not we
business to

in addition to which the chief
pathologist commander humes by he
own admission voluntarily burned his
autopsy note never released the
autopsy photo to the public
president johnson ordered the blood
soak limousine filled with bullet
hole and clue to be immediately
washed and rebuilt send john
Connallys bloody suit right to the
cleaner and when i office
finally get a court order to examine
president kennedys brain in the
national archive in the hope of
finding from what direction the
bullet come we be tell by the
government the president brain have
disappeared

so what really happen that day
let we just for a moment speculate
shall we
we have the epileptic
seizure around


distracting the police making it
easier for the shooter to move into
they place
the epileptic later
vanished never checking into the
hospital
the team get on the
th floor of the book depository



they be refurbishing the floor in
the depository that week which
allow unknown workman in and out
of the build
the man move quickly
into position just minute before
the shoot



the second spotter be probably calling
all the shot on a radio to the two
other team
he as the good overall
view the god spot



team one rifleman and one spotter
with a headset with access to the
build move into a low floor of
the DalTex build



the third team the team move in
behind the picket fence above the
grassy knoll where the shooter and
the spotter be first see by the
late lee bowers in the watchtower of
the railyard
they have the good
position of all
kennedy be close
and on a flat low trajectory



probably two to three more man be
down in the crowd on elm
ten to
twelve man
three team three
shooter
the triangulation of fire
clay shaw and david ferrie discuss
two month before
they have walk
the plaza they know every inch
they have calibrate they sight
practice on moving target
they be
ready
it be going to be a turkey
shoot
kennedys motorcade make
the turn from main onto houston



six witness see two gunman on the
sixth floor of the depository move
around
some of they think they be
policeman with rifle

probably a security agent



john powell a prisoner on the sixth
floor of the dallas county jail
see they

quite a few of we see they
everybody be hollering and yell
and that
we think be be security
guy



they do not shoot he coming up
houston which be the easy shot
for a single shooter in the book
depository but they wait till he
get to the kill zone between
three rifle
kennedy make the
final turn from houston onto elm
slow down to some mile per
hour



the shooter across Dealey plaza
tighten taking they aim across
they sight
waiting for the
radio to say green green
or abort
abort




the first shot ring out



sound like a backfire it miss
completely
frame kennedy
stop waving as he hear something
connally turn he head slightly to
the right



frame the second shot hit
kennedy in the throat from the front
frame the president emerging
from the road sign
he obviously
have be hit raising he arm to
he throat

frame the third shot the
president have be hit in the back
draw he downward and forward
connally you will notice show no
sign at all of be hit
he be
visibly holding he stetson which be
impossible if he wrist have be
shatter



Connallys turning now here
frame

the fourth shot miss kennedy
and take connally in the back
this be the key shot that prove two
rifle from the rear
this be

second after the third shot and we
know no manual bolt action rifle can
be recycled in that time
connally
be hit he mouth drop he yell
out i god they be going to kill
we all
here



the umbrella man be signalling
he be not dead
keep shooting

james Tague down at the underpass be
hit sometime now by another shot
that miss



the car brake
the fifth and fatal
shot frame take kennedy in
the head from the front



this be the key shot
watch it again
the president going back to he left
shoot from the front and right
totally inconsistent with the shot
from the depository
again
back and two the left
back and to the left
back and to
the left



what happen then
pandemonium
the shooter quickly disassemble
they various weapon all except
the oswald rifle



patrolman joe smith rush into the
park lot behind the fence
he
smell gunpowder



the character produce credentials
from he pocket which show he to
be secret service
so i accepted
that and let he go and continued
we search
but i regret it
because this guy look like an auto
mechanic
he have on a sport shirt
and pants but he have dirty
fingernail
afterwards it do not
ring true but at the time we be
so pressed for time



yet all secret serviceman in dallas
that day be account for
none
be on foot in Dealey plaza before
or after the shoot till dallas
secret service chief forrest sorrel
return at


what else be going on in Dealey
plaza that day
at least other
individual be taken into custody
by dallas police
no record of
they arrest
man acting like hoboes
be be pull off train march
through Dealey plaza photograph
and yet there be no record of they
arrest



man identifying themselves as secret
service agent be all over the
place
but who be impersonate
they



and where be lee oswald
probably
in the second floor snack room
eddie piper and william shelly see
oswald eat lunch in the first
floor lunch room around twelve
around
on she way out of the
building to see the motorcade
secretary carolyn arnold see oswald
in the second floor snack room where
he said he go for a coke



he be sitting in one of the booth
on the right hand side of the room
he be alone as usual and appear
to be have lunch
i do not speak
to he but i recognized clearly
i
remember it be
or later
it
coulda be
five minute before
the assassination i do not exactly
remember
i be pregnant and i have
a crave for a glass of water

at the same time bonnie ray williams
be supposedly eating he chicken
lunch on the sixth floor at least
until
maybe

he see
nobody



down on the street arnold rowland
be seeing two man in the sixth floor
window
presumably after bonnie
ray williams finished he lunch and
left



kennedy be running five minute
late for he appointment with death
he be due at

if oswald be
the assassin he be certainly pretty
nonchalant about get himself
into position
later he told dallas
police he be standing in the second
floor snackroom
probably tell to
wait there for a phone call by his
handler
the phone be in the
adjacent and empty second floor
office but the call never come

maximum second after kennedy be
shot patrolman Marrion baker run
into oswald in that second story
lunchroom

hey you
do you know this man
be he an
employee

yes he be
the president be shoot



but what the warren report would
have we believe be that after fire
bolt action shot in
second
oswald then leaf three cartridge
neatly side by side in the fire
nest wipe the rifle clear of
fingerprint stashes the rifle on
the other side of the loft sprint
down five flight of stairs past
witness victoria adams and sandra
style who never see he and then
show up cool and calm on the second
floor in front of patrolman baker
all this within a maximum second
of the shoot
be he out of breath
accord to baker absolutely not



assume he be the sole assassin
oswald be now free to escape from
the build
the long he delay
the more chance the build will be
sealed by the police
be he guilty
do he walk out the near
staircase
no he buy a coke and
at a slow pace spotted by mrs
reid
in the second floor office he stroll
out the more distant front exit
where the cop start to gather



oddly considering three shot be
suppose to have come from there
nobody seal the depository for ten
more minute
oswald slip out as
do several other employee
of
course when he realized something
have go wrong and the president
really have be shoot he know there
be a problem
he may even have
known he be the patsy
an intuition
maybe the president killed in spite
of he warn
the phone call that
never come
perhaps fear now come
to lee oswald
he be not going to
stand around for roll call

the story get pretty confuse now
more twist in it than a watersnake
richard carr say he see four man
take off from the book depository in
a rambler that possibly belong to
janet williams
deputy roger craig
say two man picked up oswald in the
same rambler a few minute later
other people say oswald take a bus
out of there and then because he
be stick in traffic he hop a
cab to he rooming house in oak
cliff



we must assume he wanted to get
back in touch with he intell team
probably at a safehouse or at the
texas theatre but how could he be
sure
he do not know who to trust
anymore

i god do you see that mr
lee
man shoot the president



oswald return to this rooming house
around

half hour after the
assassination put on he jacket
grab his
revolver leaf at


Earlene roberts the
housekeeper say she hear two beep
on a car horn and two uniformed cop
pulled up to the house while oswald
be in he room like it be a signal
or something
officer Tippit be
shoot between
and
about a
mile away
though no one actually
see he walking or jog the
government say oswald covered that
distance
incidentally that walk
if he do it be in a straight line
toward jack Rubys house
give
the government the benefit of the
doubt oswald would have have to jog
a mile in six to eleven minute and
commit the murder then reverse
direction and walk of a mile to
the texas theatre and arrive sometime
before

that be some walk



it be also a useful conclusion
after
all why else would oswald kill
officer Tippit unless he just shoot
the president and fear arrest
not one credible witness could
identify oswald as Tippits killer



domingo benavides the close witness
to the shoot refused to identify
oswald as the killer and be never
taken to a lineup



Acquilla Clemons see the killer with
another man and say they go off
in separate direction
mrs
Clemons
be never taken to lineup or to the
warren commission
mr
frank wright
who see the killer run away stated
flatly that the killer be not lee
oswald
oswald be find with a

revolver
Tippit be killed with a
automatic
at the scene of the
crime officer

poe mark the
shell with he initial to record
the chain of evidence



those initial be not on the three
cartridge case which the warren
commission present to he



oswald be next see by shoe salesman
johnny brewer lurking along jefferson
avenue
oswald be scare
he begin
to realize the full implication of
this thing
he go into the texas
theatre possibly he prearrange
meet point but though he have
in he pocket he do not buy the
cent ticket
brewer have the
cashier call the police



in response to the cashier call
at least thirty officer in a fleet
of patrol car descend on the movie
theatre
this have to be the most
remarkable example of police intuition
since the reichstag fire
i do not
buy it
they know someone know
oswald be going to be there
in
fact as early as
only
minute after the assassination the
police radio put out a description
match Oswalds size and build
brewer say the man be wearing a
jacket but the police say the man
who shoot Tippit left he jacket
behind
butch burroughs theatre
manager say oswald buy some
popcorn from he at the time of the
Tippit slay
burroughs and witness
bernard haire also said there be an
oswald look alike taken from the
theatre
perhaps it be he who
sneak into the theatre just after





in any case brewer helpfully lead
the cop into the theatre and from
the stage point oswald out

this be it

kill the president will you



the cop have they man
it be
already be decided in washington

kill he
kill he



dr
good Himmlers right hand man
in the gestapo once said as long
as the police carry out the will
of the leadership it be acting
legally
that mindset allow for
political murder in the weimar
republic of where the
court be controlled and the guilty
acquitted
oswald must have feel like
josef in Kafkas the trial
he
be never tell the reason of he
arrest he do not know the unseen
force ranging against he he cry
out he outrage in the police lineup
just like josef excoriate the
judge for not be tell the charge
against he
but the state be deaf
the quarry be catch
by the time
he be bring from the theatre a
large crowd be waiting to scream at
he
by the time he reach police
headquarters he be booked for
murdering Tippit



no legal counsel be provide
no
record make of the long questioning

how do you there Capn
thanks for taking
care of we down in dallas
lady
bird and i will always be grateful

thank you mr
president
we be
do we good

Capn i know you be working like a
hound dog down there to get this
mess wrapped up but i get to tell
you there be too much confusion coming
out of dallas now
the tvs and the
paper be full of rumour about
conspiracy
two gunman two rifle
the russkies do it the cuban
do it that kinda loose talk it be
carina the shit outta people bubba
this thing could lead we into a war
that could cost million live
we get to show we get this thing
under control
no question no
doubt for the good of we country
you hear i

yes sir

Capn you get you man the
investigation over that be what
people want to hear

now everyone will know who i be



by the time the sun rose the next
morning he be booked for murdering
the president
the whole country
fuel by the media assume he be
guilty



under the guise of a patriotic
nightclub owner out to spare jackie
kennedy from have to testify at a
trial jack ruby be show into the
underground garage by one of his
inside man on the dallas police force
and when he be ready oswald be bring
out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely
dispose of as an enemy of the people
by early sunday afternoon the autopsy
have be completed on he
who
grieve for lee harvey oswald
bury
in a cheap grave under the name
oswald
no one



within minute false statement and
press leak about lee oswald circulate
the globe

the official legend be created and
the media take it from there
the
glitter of official lie and the
epic splendor of the thoughtnumbing
funeral of


confuse the eye
and confound the understand
hitler always said the big the
lie the more people will believe
it
lee oswald a crazed lonely
man who wanted attention and get it
by killing a president be only the
first in a long line of patsy
in
later year bobby kennedy and martin
luther king man whose commitment to
change and to peace would make they
dangerous to man who be committed
to war would follow also killed by
such lonely crazed man who remove
we guilt by making murder a
meaningless act of a loner
we have
all become hamlet in we country
child of a slay father leader
whose killer still possess the
throne
the ghost of john
kennedy
confront we with the secret murder
at the heart of the american dream
he force on we the appal
question
of what be we
constitution make
what be we
citizenship and more we live
worth
what be the future of a
democracy where a president can be
assassinated under conspicuously
suspicious circumstance while the
machinery of legal action scarcely
tremble
how many political murder
disguised as heart attack cancer
suicide airplane and car crash
drug overdose will occur before
they be exposed for what they be

treason do never prosper write
an english poet what be the reason
for if it prosper none dare call it
treason
the general who send
dreyfus to devil island be among
the most honorable man in france
the man who killed caesar be among
the most honorable man in rome
and
the man who killed kennedy no doubt
be honorable man
i believe we
have reach a time in we country
similar to what life must have be
like under hitler in the s except
we do not realize it because fascism
in we country take the benign
disguise of liberal democracy
there
will not be such familiar sign as
swastika
we will not build Dachaus
and Auschwitzes
we be not going to
wake up one morning and suddenly
find ourselves in gray uniform goose
step off to work
fascism
will come huey long once say
in
the name of antifascism it will
come in the name of you security
they call it national security it
will come with the mass media
manipulating a clever concentration
camp of the mind
the super state
will provide you tranquility above
the truth the super state will make
you believe you be living in the
good of all possible world and in
order to do so will rewrite history
as it see fit
george Orwells
ministry of truth warn we who
control the past control the
future


the american people have yet to see
the Zapruder film
why
the american
people have yet to see the real
photograph and ray of the
autopsy
why
there be hundreds
of document that could help prove
this conspiracy
why have they be
withhold or burned by the government
each time i office or you the people
have ask those question demanded
crucial evidence the answer from on
high have be national security

what kind of national security do
we have when we have be robbed of
we leader
who determine we
national security
what national
security permit the removal of
fundamental power from the hand of
the american people and validate
the ascendancy of invisible government
in the united states
that kind of
national security gentleman of
the jury be when it smell like it
feel like it and look like it
you call it what it be it be fascism
i submit to you that what take place
on november be a coup
detat
it most direct and tragic
result be a reversal of president
kennedys commitment to withdraw
from vietnam
war be the big
business in america worth billion
a year
the president be murdered
by a conspiracy planned in advance
at the high level of the united
states government and carry out by
fanatical and disciplined cold
warrior in the pentagon and cias
covert operation apparatus among
they clay shaw here before you
it
be a public execution and it be
covered up by like minded
individual in the dallas police
department the secret service the
and the white house all the
way up to and including
edgar
hoover and lyndon johnson whom i
consider accomplice after the fact



there be a very simple way to
determine if i be be paranoid
here
let we ask the two man who have
profit the most from the
assassination you former president
lyndon baines johnson and you new
president richard nixon to release
document pertain to lee
oswald and jack ruby or the secret
memo on Oswalds activity in
russia that be destroyed while
be photocopied
all these
document be yours the people
property you pay for it but because
the government consider you child
who might be too disturbed to face
this reality because you might lynch
those involve you cannot see these
document for another year
i be
in i s so i will have shuffled
off this mortal coil by then but
i be already telling i year old
son to keep himself physically fit
so that one glorious september morning
in he can walk into the national
archive and find out what the
and the know
they may even
push it back then
it may become a
generational affair with question
passed down from father to son mother
to daughter in the manner of the
ancient runic bard
someday
somewhere someone might find out
the damn truth
or we might just
build ourselves a new government
like the declaration of independence
say we should do when the old one
be not working maybe a little far
out west

an american naturalist write a
patriot must always be ready to defend
he country against it government

well i would hate to be in you shoe
today
you have a lot to think about
go back to when we be child
i think most of we in this courtroom
think that justice come into be
automatically that virtue be it
own reward that good would triumph
over evil
but as we get old we
know that this just be not true
the frontier be where a man face a
fact
individual human being have
to create justice and this be not
easy because truth often present a
threat to power and we have to fight
power often at great risk to
ourselves
people like julia ann
mercer

holland lee bowers
jeans hill and willie OKeefe have
come forward and taken that risk
he produce a stack
of letter
i have here some in these
letter send to i office from all
over the country quarter dime
dollar bill from housewife
plumber car salesman teacher
invalid
these be the people
who cannot afford to send money but
do these be the one who drive the
cab who nurse in the hospital
who see they kid go to vietnam
why
because they care because
they want to know the truth because
they want they country back because
it belong to we the people as long
as the people get the guts to fight
for what they believe in
the truth
be the most important value we have
because if the truth do not endure
if the government murder truth if
you cannot respect the heart of
these people
then this be no long the country
in which we be born in and this be
not the country i want to die in
and this be never more true than
for john
kennedy whose murder be
probably the most terrible moment in
the history of we country
you the
people you the jury system in
sitting in judgement on clay shaw
represent the hope of humanity against
government power
in discharging
you duty in bringing the first
conviction in this house of card
against clay shaw ask not what
you country can do for you but
what you can do for you country

do not forget you young president
who forfeit he life
show the
world this be still a government of
the people for the people and by
the people
nothing as long as you
live will ever be more important
he stare into the
camera
it be up to you

we find clay shaw
not guilty on
all count

we believe there be a conspiracy
but whether clay shaw be a part of
it be another kettle of fish

mr
garrison the american media be
reporting this as a full vindication
of the warren commission do you

i think all it prove be you cannot
run a trial even questioning the
intelligence operation of the
government in the light of day

we understand that the time
picayune will call for you
resignation unfit to hold office
you have ruined clay shaws reputation
be you going to resign

hell no
i be going to run again
and
i be going to win
thank you very much
if it take i year to nail every
one of the assassin then i will
continue this investigation for
year
i owe that not only to jack
kennedy but to i country

well thank for coming

you do not get that break you needed
but you go as far as any man could
bubba
what can i do for you

just speculate i guess
how do
you think it start

i think it start in the wind
money arm big oil pentagon
people contractor banker
politician like


be committed
to a war in southeast asia
as early
as they know kennedy be going
to change thing
he be not going
to war in southeast asia
who know
probably some boardroom or lunchroom
somewhere houston new york hell
maybe bonn germany
who know
it be international now



one worry sonofabitch with a few
million dollar turn to the other
with a few million dollar
and
say something pretty direct like

the sonofabitch be going to get re
elected by a big vote than ever
in
it be going to be bad than
roosevelt
the country will not survive
as we know it

i agree bob it can not go on

and bobby in
something
get to be do

he be get to go lou
the election
get to be stopped

i talk to a lot of people
i know
i be not the only one think this

what be the feel in washington
jack



so call be make
down to
washington
all over the world
they start talking about it
few
people here there
just
conversation nothing more



general admiral people and
probably some people on the inside
of kennedys staff young brilliant
Judases ready to go to war in
southeast asia



and maybe a VicePresident get
separate memo from vietnam eager
to get he backer the billions of
dollar in contract for southeast
asia



kennedy like caesar be surround
with enemy
something be underway
but it have no face
yet everyone in
the loop know



money be at stake
big money

hundred billion
the kennedy brother
target voting district for defense
dollar
they give fighter
contract only to the county that
be going to make a difference in

these people fight back
they
way
one day another call be make



maybe to somebody like i superior
who be be running the mongoose
program out of florida and who have
no love for kennedy

bill we be going
we need you
help



Everythings cellurized
no one have
said he must die there be be no
vote there be nothing on paper
there be no one to blame
it be as
old as the crucifixion
the mafia
firing squad one blank no one
guilty because everyone in the power
structure who know anything have a
plausible deniability
there be no
compromise connection except at
the most secret point
but what be
paramount be that it must succeed
no matter how many die how much it
cost the perpetrator must be on
the win side and never subject
to prosecution for anything by anyone
that be a coup detat

when

in the fall
probably in the south
we want you to come up with a plan

he be do it before
other country
lumumba in the congo trujillo the
dominican republic he be working on
castro
no big deal
in september
kennedy announce the texas trip
at that moment second Oswalds start
pop up all over dallas where
they have the mayor and the cop in
they pocket
fly in the
assassin maybe from the special
camp we keep outside athens greece
pro maybe some local cuban
maria hire separate team
do it
really matter who shoot from what
rooftop
part of the scenery
the
assassin by now be dead or well
paid and long go

any chance of one of they confess
someday

do not think so
when they start
to drool they get rid of they
these
guy be proud of what they do
they do Dealey plaza
they take
out the president of the united
states
that be entertainment
and
they serve they country do it

and you general

get promote to two star but he
be never military you know always

go to vietnam lost he
credibility when we get beat over
there retire live in virginia
i say hello to he when i see he at
the supermarket

ever ask he

you never ask a spook a question
no point
he will never give you a
straight answer
general still
think of himself of the handsome
young warrior who loved this country
but loved the concept of war more

he name

do it matter
another technician
but an interesting thing he be
there that day in Dealey plaza
you
know how i know
that picture of yours
the hoboes
you never look deep enough



i know the man year
that be
he
the way he walk
arm at
he side military the stoop the
haircut the twist leave hand the
large class ring
what be he do
there
if anyone have ask he
he would probably say protection but
i will tell you i think he be giving
some kind of okay signal to those
hoboes they be about to get booked
and he be telling they it be going to be
okay they be covered
and in fact
they be you never hear of they
again

some story
the whole thing
it be like it never happen

it never do

just think
just think
what
happen to we country
to the
world
because of that murder
vietnam racial conflict breakdown
