later

badly
do he say something

no but he be covered with old
wound all sort of scar
knife
scar bullet scar burn

soldier

there be word on he shoulder
Tannhauser gate the argentine
sector montana bolivia shanghai


the Tannhauser gate be a battle

we will have to sleep on the floor

where be nathan

if there be any danger to nathan

i will not permit danger to nathan



you must be
you must be feeling
well

we be teaching the boy to walk

he be late learn
he be sick for
a long time

i get something for you

here

like this

see

practice with it
in a day or two
maybe you will be strong enough to go
out to the garden with sandra


i come for nathan

let we go
come on sergeant



this way


you have to watch out for they
they probably would not kill someone
you size not if you be healthy
anyway
but they would make you pretty
sick
someone small
like i or
a child

in a month this one will be as big
as those

here
you try one


you can not talk to a soldier no more
than you can talk to a
a
bomb
or a bullet
they be trained
they be killing machine
they get
an objective and they go after that
objective and nothing stop they but
killing they

a glance over his
shoulder
just one
to kill we all

first off if there be one there be
more
that be how it be soldier
travel in bunch
second they
do not waste soldier on folk
like we that be for police
train
soldier to kill weakling like we
be not what they call cost
effective


then who do they fight

other soldier
there be a say
soldier deserve soldier


slade hush up

you see how much he be eating

i do not see how you can not remember
how you get here sergeant

you be not a deserter be you
sergeant

no sir

then how come you be not with you
unit

oh come on slade let the man eat

it be not an unreasonable question
how about it sergeant

i be
replace

replace

by a good soldier sir



and it get bad and bad
i
father have not have any work in three
month and
also
there be other
thing
violence
political
feeling
i father said he would hear
it be good in the trinity moon
lot of other people must have have
the same idea because the ship be
jammed with people
mostly
family
that be probably why it
broke down
overload

even after they make the repair it
barely get off the ground it be an
old convert mining transport a
piece of junk to start with
it
just
drop
maybe you see
what be leave of it
out there in the
wind
lot of people die
and we
could not make any radio contact
so we be stick here
nobody be
happy about it
few year later
when the dumper start coming over
and dropping stuff people tried to
get they attention with explosion
and fire
but it do not work
they must be unmanned
or they just
do not care
maybe they think we be
garbage too

so there really be not any choice
people have to pull together and make
the good of it
we become a
community

one good thing
nobody bother we
Whod want to fight over a
godforsaken place like this

i guess that be what you like
the
fighting i mean
the war
unsure a question
really
you must
you be a soldier


you child be suppose to be
do lesson

lesson





she be down now but she will come up
again
always do

that be why we be weighing down
and
that be why we be always on the wire
even when the windas down like now
you do not get much warn
here
load up you will want the weight i
promise

oh we be not going to shoot
anything
that be not what we mean
by hunt

then laughing to
jimmy pig
jimmy pig you be not going to shoot
anything be you

what could i hit

it be how we call for help
two
shot
Therell be someone on duty
listening in case we get off the
wire and get lose or something
we
have flare too
come on


sandra said she told you how we
wind up here
we parent and so
on
turning left
indicate
over here we call these catcher
trench


small stuff that blow across the
ground it fall in these trench
it work sort of like a filter
we
go through the trench sometimes
and get some good stuff

we try to work they when they be dry
it be lousy going in there when
they be flooded
you can see

whatever look useful if we can get
a rope to it we will go for it
but
you can not ever go far than you
safety line because it will come up on
you with sometimes maybe ten second
or even less

like right now
you hear that

it be close when you hear that

she be going to





can not

can not



uh thank sergeant
thanks a
lot

dumper
they come every twenty or
thirty day

thanks partner
these nogoods
would have just let i blow away




sorry to disturb the tranquillity of
outer space on christmas eve but
i be off to the caribbean in a few
hour and i wanted to make sure
you would get the transmission on the
security sweep

we get it all right
this be an
outpost here not the third army
you have get we secure thirtyfour
location and erecting monitor unit
in one month and

piece of cake guy
these be
totally remote totally uninhabited
territory
all you do be set
down send out a patrol purely as a
formality then have those veteran
of yours put up an AType unmanned
monitor unit
you should be on
about number twentyfive by the time
i get back from i vacation

what if we do run into people
say squatter or refugee

well you sure as hell do not want to
get involve in evacuate people
and that sort of thing
i advice would be to
avoid
paperwork


eliminate they you mean

well no one out there but
officially these be hostile
zone
therefore you would be within
you right to classify anyone as
hostile i think
but i repeat you should be worry
about boredom not action
any
other question before i go

down there
be it snow

not in the caribbean
have a good
christmas guy
see you when i get
back

merry christmas captain


hi fella
at ease

merry christmas everybody

we bring you a little christmas
tree

and some good cheer

how about some christmas pussy
guy
anybody for a quick piece

that be conduct unbecoming sloan

it be christmas
have not you hear
of piece on earth
piece on
earth get it

suddenly serious
sober
christ i wish we be on earth

eat drink and be merry man
for
tomorrow you go on patrol in the
hostile zone









we will eat these


it seem like he be never going to
walk
then all of a sudden
he be
an expert

well not quite an expert

sergeant todd
what be it
like
what be it like be a
soldier

what do you think about

do you think about food
or woman
you must think about something

what about feeling then
you must
have feeling
you must feel
something

fear

fear
you mean
you feel afraid
that be when you be in battle
what about other time
now for
example

fear

now

always

you do not
look afraid
you look
fearless

fear and
discipline

oh i god
but there be nothing to
be afraid of here
i can not hurt
you
i would not

always
it make we
alert


you be not suppose to do that
anymore

so what
i be a soldier

they be going to kick he out

they can not kick he out

they be going to
i father

i mother say when someone sick
or hurt you have to help they
you
do not have a choice

yeah but what if the hurt person
be
evil

you still have to help they
because if you do not you be evil

i father say
uh
he say
soldier deserve soldier


yeah
that be what i father said
too

i father making sergeant todd a
scarf because he saved he life one
time
he be knitting it

that be dumb
you father dumb




jimmy knitted it himself
he worked
on it for two month

it be beautiful jimmy
he will love
it

he saved i life out there
i guess
mace told you

you should give it to he yourself
i think he be in the meet room
do
exercise


scarf
scarf


what
what
be
those
chester


those be i war mark
from the
battle i fight


there be going to be a meet
people be upset about he

he be not fully recovered

that be what scare people
he get
strong every day

real effort and no real
feel

he told i he be afraid

maybe he be
it do not matter





what happen


no one here have any animosity toward
you sergeant
none of we here be
you enemy

moreover we respect you quality
we have no doubt that you be a
very very good soldier



but because of you train i
do not think you will ever be able to
function in a group like this a
community of vulnerable people of
family of child where the
ability to fight be not the sole
purpose of existence

you be different from we sergeant
we do not hate you for that but we
have agreed that to try to include
you would pose an intolerable risk
to the community itself

we will give you any tool you need
warm clthe a good knife boot

and if you be ever sick
or you get
hurt

you be a friend sergeant
it be
just


if you need we
you can ask we for
help

it be not true
