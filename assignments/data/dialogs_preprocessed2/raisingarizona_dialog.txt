work be what be keep we happy

yeah but doc schwartz be sayin you
get to accept responsibility
i
mean i be proud to say i get a
family
somewheres

i tried to sort through what the doc

place to think

i know that sir

okay then

now i do not know how you come down
on the incarceration question

whether it be for rehabilitation
or revenge

but i be beginning to think

that revenge be the only argument
make any sense

turn to the right



do not forget he latents ed



hear about the paddywagon collide
with the segment mixer ed
twelve
hardened criminal escaped

do not worry i paid for it

they say that absence make the heart
grow fond and for once they may
be right

you missed a spot

grrrr

more and more i thought turned to
ed and i finally feel the pain of
imprisonment

an momma would frow the live crawdad
in a pot of boiln water
well one
day i decided to make i own
crawdad

an i frew it in a pot forgettin
to put in the water you see

and it be like i be makin
popcorn you see
the joint be a
lonely place after lockup and fight
out

when the last of the con have
be sweep away by the sandman

but i could not help think that a
bright future lay ahead a future
that be only eight to fourteen month
away

get a name for people like you hi
that name be called recidivism

Reepeat Ofender

not a pretty name be it hi

no sir it sure be not
that be one
bonehead name
but that be not i
anymore

you be not just tellina we what we
want to hear

no sir no way

because we just want to hear the truth

well then i guess i be tellina you
what you want to hear

boy do not we just tell you not to
do that

yessir

okay then

i be walkin in here on i knee ed
a free man proposin

how do you kurt

and so it be



do not forget the bookay ed

i do

you bet i do

okay then

ed pa stake we to a starter home
in suburban tempe

and i get a job drilling hole in
sheet metal

so we be do paramedical work in
affiliation with the state highway
systemnot actually practicin
understand and i and bill
patrollin down nine mile

bill roberts

no not that motherscratcher
bill
parker
anyway we be approachin
the wreck and there be a spherical
object arestin on the highway

and it do not look like a piece a
the car

Mostways the job be a lot like
prison except ed be waitin at the
end of every day

and a paycheck at the end of every
week

Gummint do take a bite do not she

these be the happy day the salad
day as they say

and ed feel that have a critter
be the next logical step
it be
all she think about

she point be that there be too
much love and beauty for just the
two of we

and every day we keep a child out
of the world be a day he might later
regret have missed

that be beautiful

so we worked at it on the day we
calculated most likely to be
fruitful

and we worked at it most other
day just to be sure

seem like nothing could stand in
we way now

i lawless year be behind i
we child rearin year lay ahead

it be true i have have a checkered past
but ed here be an officer of the law
twice decorated

so we figure it kind of even
out

but biology and the prejudice of
other conspire to keep we childless

we love for each other be strong
than ever

but i preminisced no return of
the salad day

the pizazz have go out of we live

ed lost all interest in both criminal
justice and housekeeping
soon after
she tender she badge

even i job seem as dry and bitter
as a hot prairie wind

so here come bill awalkin down
nine mile that be bill parker
understand get he sandwich in
one hand the fuckin head in the
other

i even caught myself drivin by
convenience store

that be not on the way home

then one day the big news hit
the state since they build the hoover
dam

the arizona quints be born

by arizona quints i mean they be
born to a woman named florence
arizona

as you probably guess florence
arizona be the wife of nathan arizona
and nathan arizona well hell you
know who he be

so come on down to unpainted arizona
for the fine selection in fixture
and appointment for you bathroom
bedroom beaudoir

unpainted furniture and bathroom
fixture outlet throughout the
southwest

and if you can find low price
anywhere i name be not nathan arizona

yep florence have be taking
fertility pill and she and nathan
have hit the jackpot

now you all who without sin can
cast the first stone

but we think it be unfair that
some should have so many while other
should have so few

with the benefit of hindsight maybe
it be not such a hot idea

but at the time ed little plan
seem like the solution to all we
problem and the answer to all we
prayer

eight hundred leaf table and no
chair
you can not sell leaf table
and no chair
chair you get a
dinette set

we need someone handy with a scatter
gun to cover the hayseeds while we

reward coming
twenty thousand
dollar

or if you need home furnishing
i can give you a fine of credit at
any of i store
fact that be the
way i would rather handle it for tax
reason

prefer the can

we do not want no reward

we do not bring he back for money

bit more

committed the actual crime sir if
you need to call the authority

authority if there be no harm do

tell i why you do it

we can not have we own

well lookit
if you can not have
kid you get to just keep tryin and
hope medical science catch up with
you
like Florencen i it caught
up with a vengeance
and hell even
if it never do you still get each
other

sir those kind word
but i think
the wife and i be splittin up

kinda selfish and unrealistic so we
be not too good for each other

well madam i do not know much but i
do know human bein
you bring
back i boy so you must have you
good point too
i would sure hate to
think of florence leavin i i do
love she so

you can go out the way you come
in

and before you go off and do
another foolish thing like bust
up i suggest you sleep on it

at least one night

that night i have a dream

i dream i be as light as the
ether a float spirit visiting
thing to come

the shade and shadow of the people
in i life wrastled they way into
i slumber

i dream that gale and Evelle have
decided to return to prison

probably that be just as well
i
do not mean to sound superior and
they be a swell couple guy but

maybe they be not ready yet to
come out into the world

and then i dream on into the
future to a christmas morn in the
arizona home


where nathan jr
be opening a
present from a kindly couple who
preferred to remain unknown

i see glen a few year later still
have no luck gettin the cop to
listen to he wild tale about mean
ed

maybe he threw in one pollack
joke too many

i do not know

and still i dream on

**further/far into the future than i would
ever dream before

watch nathan jr
s progress
from afar

take pride in he accomplishment
as if he be we own

wonder if he ever think of
we

and hope that maybe we would
broaden he horizon a little
even if he could not remember just
how they would get broaden

but still i have not dream nothing
about mean ed
until the end


and this be cloudy because it
be year year away

but i see an old couple bein
visit by they child and all
they grandchildren too
and the old
couple be not screw up and neither
be they kid or they grandkid
and i do not know you tell i
this
whole dream be it wishful think
be i just fleein reality like i
know i be liable to do

but mean ed we can be good too

and it seem real
it seem
like we
