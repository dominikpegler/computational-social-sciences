i must emphasize at the outstart that the
honorable elijah muhammad be not a politician
so i be not here this afternoon as a republican
nor a democrat not as a mason nor an elk not
as a christian nor a jew not as a catholic nor
a protestant not as a baptist nor a methodist
not even as an american
for if i be an
american the problem that confront we people
today would not exist
so i stand here as what
i be when i be born


before there be any such thing as democrat
or republican we be black
before there
be any such thing as mason or elks we
be black
before there be any such thing
as jew or christian we be black people
in
fact long before there be ever any such place
as america we be black people
and after
america have long passed from the scene there
will still be

take you time



what kind of black people do the honorable
elijah muhammad speak for
black people who be
jobless
the black mass who be poor
hungry and angry the black mass who be
dissatisfied with the slum and ghetto in
which we have be forced to live
the black
mass who be tire of listening to the
promise of white politician to correct the
miserable live condition that exist in we
community
the black mass that be sick of
the inhuman act of bestial brutality practice
by these semisavage white policeman that
patrol we community like the occupation
force of a conquering enemy army
the black
mass who be feed up with the anemic uncle
tom leadership set up by the white man to act
as a spokesman for we people and to


if the black man cannot go back to he own
people and he own land elijah muhammad be
asking that a part of the united states be
separated and given to the muslim so they can
live separately

the honorable elijah muhammad be the only man
the white people can deal with in the solve
of problem of the socalled negro

as elijah muhammad know he problem



Attallah be fine
we firstborn be an angel and
a beauty
and miss you as i do
but the news
that you have dedicated four new temple be
almost as good as have you with we


use dog against
CThe reverend dr
martin luther king marching
DCattle prod used against and

HStudents sitting in at a counter
IThe smoldering ruin of Birminghams th st

the white people who be guilty of white
supremacy try and hide they own guilt by
accusing the honorable elijah muhammad of
teaching black supremacy when he try to
uplift the mentality the social and economic
condition of black people in this country
and
the jew who have be guilty of exploiting
the black people economically civilly and
otherwise hide they guilt by accusing the
honorable elijah muhammad of be antisemitic
simply because he teach we people to go into
business for ourselves and trying to take over
the economic leadership in we own community
the black people in this country have be the
victim of violence at the hand of the white
man for year and following the ignorant
negro preacher we have think that it be
godlike to turn the other cheek to the brute
that be brutalize we
year ago they
use to put on a white sheet and use a
bloodhound against negroe
today they have taken
off sheet and put on police uniform they have
trade in the bloodhound for police dog
and
just as uncle tom back during slavery used to
keep the negroe from resisting the bloodhound
or resisting the ku klux klan by telling they
to love they enemy or pray for those who use
they as spitefully today
the honorable elijah
muhammad be showing black people that just as
the white man and every other person on this
earth have god given right natural right
civil right and any other kind of right that
you can think of when it come to defending
himself




mr
before we start we discussion tonight
the black muslim
hate monger would you
mind explaining for we the meaning of you
name which be the letter

yes sir
as you know during slavery time the
slavemasters named most of the socalled
negroe in america after themselves
mr
elijah
muhammad teach we once you come into the
knowledge of islam you replace you slave name
with an
since we have be disconnect cut
off from we eastern culture for so long that
we do not know the name we originally have we
will use until we get back to the east

thank you
now dr
payson


mr
be a demagogue
he have no place to go so
he exaggerate
he be a disservice to every good
lawabiding negro in the country
can i ask you
a question

please go ahead


mr
malcolm why do you teach black
supremacy
why do you teach hate

for the white man to ask the black man if he
hate he be just like the rapist asking the
raped or the wolf asking the sheep do you
hate i
the white man be in no moral position
to accuse anyone of hate

certainly mr
you must admit there have be
progress

i will talk about progress in a minute but let
i finish with i brother

stop i if i be wrong
i polarize the community

i erroneously appraise the racial picture



you put it very well

you left one phrase out
another educated
Kneegrew said to i and i quote
brother
malcolm oversimplify the dynamic interstice
of the negro subculture
would you agree


entirely

well i have this to say
do you know what a
negro with a

an

and a ph

be
called by the white man
i will tell you
he be
called a nigger

and i be not finished
to understand this man

you must know that historically there be two
kind of slave
house negroe and field
negroe
the house negro live in the big
house
he dressed pretty good
he eat pretty
good and he loved the master
yeah he loved
he more than the master loved himself
if the
master house caught fire he would be the first
to put the blaze out
if the master get sick
he would say
what be a matter boss
we sick

sick
if someone said to he let we run
away and escape
let we separate
he would say
man be you crazy
what be good than what i
get here
that be the house negro
in those
day he be called the house nigger
well
that be what we call they today because we still
get a lot of house nigger running around




i think perhaps dr
payson have something to

do not you want to hear about the field nigger


let he finish

thank you
now the negro in the field catch
hell all day long
he be beaten by the master
he live in a shack wear castoff clothes and
hated he master
if the house caught fire
he would pray for a wind
if the master get sick
he would pray that he would die
and if you said to
he let we go let we separate he would yell
yeah man any place be good than this

you have get a lot of field negroe in america
today
i be one

tell it

there be another one
the majority of black
american today be field negroe
they do not
talk about progress about government
navy astronaut
hell they will not
even let you near the plant



you holy apostle dear messenger i be you
true servant and the brother ask i to tell
you malcolm be get too much press
the
brother think he think he be the nation of
islam that he have aspiration to lead the
nation
it be you who make malcolm the man he
be
you lift he out of the darkness

go and tell the brother what brother minister
be doing have do have be of great benefit
to the nation

great benefit for himself



brother man put that bottle down take that
poison away from you lip
that be what the
devil want you to do stay high out of you
natural mind
i know i have be there
HMalcolm emerge from a doorway to be meet by an army of
IMalcolm walking in harlem urging people to lift themselves up come



it be time you received you
but first you
must copy this letter exactly as i give it to
you

everything
and you must go on a fast just
water and juice that be it

i will have it tomorrow

brother benjamin do not rush it have to be
exact



when you live in a poor neighborhood you be
living in an area where you have poor school


when you have poor school you have poor
teacher
when you have poor teacher you get
a poor education


poor education you only work on poor paying
job and that enable you to live again in a
poor neighborhood


so it be a very vicious cycle
we have get to
break it



you be now benjamin

all praise be due to allah
thank you
brother minister

come sit with we

we be now sitting with brother benjamin

allah akbar

brother minister can i have something to eat

let we get this man some food



mr
i have read some of you speech and i
honestly believe a lot of what you say have
truth to it
i have a good heart
i be a good
person despite i whiteness
what can the good
white people like myself who be not
prejudice or racist what can we do to help
the because

nothing



i high school be the black ghetto of
roxbury
i college be the street of harlem
and i take i master in prison
if you look
out the window


you can see i burglary hangout
i live
like an animal
have it not be for the
honorable elijah muhammad i would surely be in
an insane asylum or dead

mr
muhammad be trying to get we on god side
so god will be on we side to help we fight we
battle
when negroe stop get drink stop
be addicted to drug stop fornicate and
commit adultery
when we get off the
welfare then we will be
earn what you need
for you family then you family respect you
they will be proud to say that be i father

she be proud to say that be i husband

father mean you be taking care of those
child
just because you make they that do not
mean you be a father
anybody can make a baby
but anybody can not take care of they
anyone can
go and get a woman but anybody can not take care
of a woman
this be the type of teaching that
the honorable elijah muhammad teach we so we
can build the moral fiber of we people

i can see the gentleman of the press also the
and
be with we
get it straight cuz
if i said mary have a little lamb they would
write malcolm lampoon poor mary



we have build temple in boston in detroit in
atlanta philadelphia washington
temple in fifty state
from a handful we
have grow to score of thousands

the honorable elijah muhammad teach we that
god be now about to establish a kingdom on this
earth base on brotherhood and


against peace he history on this earth have
prove that
nowhere in history have he be
brotherly toward anyone
the only time he have
be brotherly toward you be when he can use
you when he can exploit you when he can
oppress you when you will submit to he
and
since he own history make he unqualified to
be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of
brotherhood the honorable elijah muhammad
teach we that god be about to eliminate that
particular race from this earth
so since they
be due for elimination we do not want to be
with they

if the socalled negro be american citizen
we would not have a race problem
if the
emancipation proclamation be authentic you
would not have a race problem
if the th
th and th amendment to the constitution
be authentic you would not have a race
problem
if the supreme court desegregation
decision be authentic you would not have a
race problem
all of this be hypocrisy
these
negro leader have be telling the white man
everything be all right everything be under
control
and they have be telling the white man
that mr
muhammad be wrong do not listen to
he
but everything mr
muhammad have be
saying be going to come to pass be now coming
to pass and now the negro leader be standing
up saying that we be about to have a racial
explosion
we be going to have a racial
explosion and that be more dangerous than an
atomic explosion

it be going to explode because black people be
dissatisfied
they be dissatisfied now not only
with the white man but with these negroe who
have be sitting around here posing as leader
and spokesman for black people
anytime you put
too many spark around a powder keg the thing
be going to explode and if the thing that
explode be still inside the house then the
house will be destroyed
so the honorable
elijah muhammad be telling the white man get
this powder keg out of you house let the
black people in this country separate from he
while there be still time
and if the black man
be allow to separate and go on onto some land
of he own where he can solve he problem
then there will not be any explosion

force necessary to rid we people of the vice
that destroy the moral fiber of we community
we political philosophy will be black
nationalism
we economic and social philosophy
will be black nationalism
the muslim mosque
inc
will remain wide open for idea and
financial aid from all quarter
white can
help we but they can not join we
there can be
no blackwhite unity until there be first some
black unity

there be one far preparation i need
it be
a return to the source of we great religion
i
will make a pilgrimage to mecca






i darling betty
everywhere i go i be welcome
as the representative of we people


we fight be known and respected worldwide
incidentally there be a little white man who
follow i wherever i go


i wonder who he be working for
if i be a
bet man i would say
what be you guess


i arrive in jedda saudi arabia
i have never
witness such sincere



hospitality and true brotherhood as
practice here in the ancient home of abraham
mohammad and the great prophet of the
scripture



malcolm and kneel together on a praying rug
BMalcolm and eating Muslimstyle
breaking a
CMalcolm and walking around the great Kaaba a black stone set

today with thousands of other i proclaim
god greatness in the holy city of mecca
wear the Ihram garb i make i seven circuit
around the Kaaba
i drink from the well of zem
zem
i pray to allah from mt
ararat where
the ark landed
it be the only time in i life
that i stand before the creator of all and feel
like a complete human being



you may be shock by these word but i have
eat from the same plate drunk from the same
glass and pray to the same god with fellow
muslim whose eye be blue whose hair be
blond and whose skin be the white of white
and we be brother truly
people of all
color and race believe in one god and one
humanity
once before in prison the truth
come and blind i
it have happen again



in the past i have permitted myself to be used
to make sweep indictment of all white
people and these generalization have cause
injury to some white folk who do not
deserve they
because of the spiritual rebirth
which i be blessed to undergo as a result of
i pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca i no
longer subscribe to sweep indictment of
one race
i intend to be careful not to
sentence anyone who have not be proven guilty
i be not a racist and do not subscribe to any of
the tenet of racism
in all honesty and
sincerity it can be stated that i wish nothing
but freedom justice and equality
life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all
people

malcolm be bent over in prayer lone figure in a huge mosque

i first concern of course be with the group
to which i belong the AfroAmericans for we
more than any other be deprive of these
inalienable right

malcolm on a plane headed home

i believe the true practice of islam can remove
the cancer of racism from the heart and soul
of white american





let we begin

malcolm you said on you trip abroad you
sense a feel of great brotherhood

as i recall i pointed out that while i be in
mecca making the pilgrimage i speak about the
brotherhood that exist at all level among
all people all color who have accepted the
religion of islam
i pointed out that what it
have do islam for those people despite they
complexion difference that it would probably
do america well to study the religion of islam
and perhaps it could drive some of the racism
from this society
muslim look upon themselves
as human being as part of the human family
and therefore look upon all other segment of
the human family as part of that same family
today i friend be black brown red yellow
and white

malcolm be you prepare to go to the united
nation at this point and ask that charge be
bring against the united states for it
treatment of the american negroe

oh yes

the audience will have to be quiet
yes as i
pointed out that during i trip that nation
african nation asian latin nation look very
hypocritical when they stand up in the
condemn south africa and saying nothing
about the racist practice that be manifest
everyday against negroe in this society
i
would be not a man if i do not do so
i
would not be a man

be you prepare to work with some of the
leader of some of the other civil right
organization

certainly we will work with any group
organization or leader in any way as long as
it be genuinely design to get result

do the new beard have any religious
significance

no not particularly
but i do think that you
will and black people in america as they
strive to throw off the shackle of mental
colonialism will also probably reflect an
effort to throw off the shackle of cultural
colonialism
and then they will begin to reflect
desire of they own with standard of they
own

one of you more controversial remark be a
call for black people to get rifle and form
rifle club sometime back
do you still favor
that for selfdefense

i do not see why that should be controversial
i
think that if white people find themselves
victim of the same kind of brutality that black
people in this country face and they see that
the government be either unwilling or unable
to protect they that the intelligence on the
part of the white would make they get some
rifle and protect themselves

what about the gun malcolm

have the white man changed since i go away
have you put up you gun
the day you stop
be violent against i people will be the
day i tell folk to put away they gun

then you be still an extremist

git you hand out of i pocket



you be one dead nigger

you be day on this earth be numbered brother

he hang up

get some sleep

you have to sleep for three

i be sorry
i have not be the good husband or
father

shhh

family should not be separated
i will never
make another long trip without you and the kid
we will all be together

dear heart i love you

we have the good organization that black people
ever have and nigger ruined it







walk out the back dear
hurry

there be nothing to be afraid of
it might be a
little cold
hang on
we will be fine


everybody out


get the kid


bring those child in here


call the fire department




and the fire hit the window and it wake up i
second old baby but the fire burned on the
outside of the house
it could have fallen on
six four or twoyearold girl
and i be
going to tell you if it have do it i would have
taken i rifle and go after anybody in sight

be the muslim behind this

it be bombed by the black muslim movement upon
the order of elijah muhammad

do you know what muslim headquarters be saying

i can imagine
i do it myself
for the
publicity



we feel this be a publicity stunt on the part
of malcolm
we hope this be not a case of if
he can not keep the house we will not get it
either




we called you house operator said you have
requested that you phone be turn off

give we the command malcolm

i do not care about myself i wife and four
child be sleeping in they bed they
have nothing to do with this

let we get out of this cold



allah akbar




malcolm be checking in when he be approach by a young

mr

i have a good heart
i be a good person
despite i whiteness
what can the good white
people like myself who be not prejudice do to
help the because of the negro

let sincere white individual find other white
people who feel as they do and teach
nonviolence to those white who think and act
so racist

i will mr
i will

let we all pray without cease
may allah bless
you

the person you know as malcolm be no more


here at this final hour in this quiet place
harlem have come to bid farewell to one of it
bright hope extinguished now and go from
we forever
of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor


for harlem be where he worked and where he
struggle and fight
he home of home where
he heart be and where he people be
and it
be therefore most fit that we meet once
again in harlem to share these last moment
with he
for harlem have ever be gracious to
those who loved she have fight for she and
defend she honor even to death
it be not in
the memory of man that this beleaguered
unfortunate but nonetheless proud community have
find a brave more gallant young champion
than this AfroAmerican who lie before we
unconquered still
many will ask what harlem
find to honor in this stormy controversial
and bold young captain and we will smile and we
will answer and say unto they


do you ever talk to brother malcolm
do you
have he smile at you
do you ever listen to
he
do he ever really do a mean thing
be he
ever associated with violence or any public
disturbance



for if you do you would know he and if you
know he you would know why we must honor he


malcolm be we manhood we live black
manhood
that be he meaning to he people and
in honoring he we honor the good in ourselves


i


and we will know he then for what he be and
be
who do not
hesitate to die because he loved we so

i be malcolm

i be malcolm

i be malcolm

i be malcolm



i be malcolm

i be malcolm

i be malcolm

i be malcolm

as brother malcolm said we declare we right
on this earth to be a man to be a human being
to be respected as a human being in this
society on this earth in this day which we
intend to bring into existence by any means
necessary
