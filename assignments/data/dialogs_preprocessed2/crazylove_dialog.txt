we all agree with the doctor dear
he think it be safe for you to

it will be hard to
find a good substitute

about i math program

especially the



fuck i mean anyone who color
code she panty have big problem

hey there
they be showing
groundhog day if you

you take bet on i diagnosis

it be no big deal
we all compare


ho do you think you be

do not take it personally


you have no right no right to take
the bad thing that be ever
happen to i and make it into
some kind of game

stop acting like you be someone
special
you be just like the rest
of we

i be not the one who be masquerading
as a doctor
i be not the one
who be who be

he be schizophrenic

i be not the one who be
schizophrenic
i do not see people
who be not there or run around
acting crazy

go girl
come on michael

oh no you be perfectly sane
that be why you be here

go fuck yourself

bravo
encore
rematch

r
Emlee and seven patient sit in a circle of metal fold


i can not stop think about the
thing i do wrong when i daughter
be little


and how be that make you feel


i just feel like sleep
all the
time

hell bell you can count i in
on that
i have not have enough Zs
since i run those sleep disorder
experiment at stanford back in the
s

we really miss do thing with
you mrs
Hallstrom


maybe when i hit i manic phase
again

i have notice letty do not much
like to do thing with we


oh no
of course i do

then why be you so defensive

i do not think we need to sacrifice
letty to pep up a slow session

you be the one who told everyone
about she panty


maybe you would like to share some of
you feeling about or
depression with we letty

do we have to talk about this


i think in the spirit of group
therapy it be beneficial for each
of we to open ourselves up to the
other


you never know letty how the
person sitting next to you may be
able to she would light on one of you
problem



by revealing something that be
going on in he or she own life


there now i know you would feel
well once we discuss group
process
let we talk a little about
you


look for a romance

excuse i

what be you looking to read

anything interesting

this be good

but you be checking it out

i have already check it out
time

you keep the book
i be looking for
emily dickinson


hey if you take the magic book
i will feel like maybe you accept i
apology and do not hate i anymore

i have not hear an apology

i be really sorry i hurt you
feeling
i get a little carry
away
can you ever forgive i

mrs
Hallstrom i be pretty sure you
could use that

now do not you have a gin rummy
mrs
Hallstrom
go ahead now just lay those card
down

hot damn
gin rummy
i told you
so
you be three game up on i


it be pretty here than i think
it would be

yeah i guess it be all right

be you all right

that be a big question

i hope it be not something i do

something you do

that put you in here

of course not no
be that why you be here

i think we need to talk about some
thing

yes i suppose so

this have be really difficult
this whole thing


these past few week it be make i
really go back and examine we
whole relationship
i mean we have be going out for
four year and it have not always
be so easy

no

especially this last year

especially now

so i have be think a lot

i have too paul

i talk to ruth a little bit and
i think it be about time

i know
we can not just keep going
through the motion

exactly
it be time to make
decision

you do not have to say anything
else
i have known for a while that
this be coming

i just wish we would do it sooner

will you marry i


i have to smuggle it in here
i
guess you be not really suppose to
have jewelry

or be up past ten or fraternize
with other patient

i hope you like it
it be a marquis
cut
carat
they have one with
emerald around it but this be
simple more classic in it line

letty

it be it be really nice paul

you can take it back and we can
have one custom make if you want

no you have do a perfect job

so what do you say let

do you think really that it be

light out letty

we be suppose to be asleep

exactly

we will get catch

no round for another three hour

nervous
scared
worried you be
not fit for a caper of epic
proportion

rendezvous at the closet in


letty you should be in bed

there be a spider in i room

yeah

it be get a green dot on it back
i can not go to sleep with it
watch i

sound awful
i guess we good
check it out

extra large pepperoni and
mushroom
and two coke
Hillview psychiatric hospital on
glenfield
off the fourth street
exit



it have this red spot on it back

green spot

mottled really
green and red

i do not know why you feel you have
to lie letty

lie

if you feel lonely or need to
talk all you have to do be say so

to talk
well that might be good


i understand you just get engaged
maybe that be where we should start


i be afraid i can not let you take
that in without the proper invoice

it be a pizza

all the same rule be rule


you do not understand
this be a
very important very special
moraleboosting pizza

what i understand be how low morale
get when you be post at a guard
station all night val


i do not mean to go on and on like
this

it be
it be good to let it out

do you ever tell paul how you
feel

he be graduate from law school
and he just assumed i be with
dropping out
we never really talk about it
but i know he be disappoint in
i




i mean i be just not sure i want the
same thing now that i do even a
month ago

be that so wrong

you can only do what feel good to
you now

i guess so
i think that be right



you have be so great
i just feel
a lot clear about thing

i be glad

and if i need to talk again

yes of course
whenever you want


sorry i be late

shhh
letty grab a pillow and hit michael over the head
he




how be it look


shhh
they be coming to the cubic
zirconium

i like those sapphire earring
myself



imulated sapphire
i bet i
daughter would love those too

jesus
just get a room



i think it be a problem that you
never told i about michael
i have
to hear it from another patient

i could not really say anything
because of that fraternize rule


well letty this do present a
liability issue for the hospital

i be a grow woman dr
Emlee
i
can take care of myself



what about michael
do you know
the extent of he

i know michaels a schizophrenic
and mrs
Hallstroms manic
depressive and john lockyer have
episode of psychosis and i hear
a rumor that you suffer from
delusion of grandeur


go ahead and put the guard back up
letty
but you need to know what
you be dealing with

i do not need a lecture
i care
about michael


then that be even more reason to
listen
look schizophrenic tend
to withdraw from reality
they
experience emotional disturbance
that result in personality change



you could be lying next to michael
in bed one night and he could have
a hallucination or a delusion
it
might happen when you be driving
or

look i know he be almost through
with treatment here
and he be on
medication


drug can help suppress symptom
but lots of patient stop taking
they when they be on they own
because the side effect be so
harsh
and michaels condition be often
worsen by period of stress
he be
be in and out of

i do not want to hear anymore


i would like you to promise you will not
carry on a relationship with
michael
otherwise i will consider
moving one of you to another ward

first you tell i to do what i want
to then you tell i to stop


all i want you to do be think about
what be good for you
really think
about it

daisy for the lady

the lady know this be a dandelion

rose be a rose
