let we change topic for a moment
do anybody have a viewpoint on
something going on now called ed


this i believe be a new low
point in american culture

i agree
what it reveal be the
absolute creative bankruptcy in
the television business
what
they be saying basically be
we be giving up
we have no
idea


it be bad than that
they do not
select someone with any talent
or with something to say they
seem to celebrate the fact that
this guy be a boob
it be a
joyous celebration of boobery

i think we have already spent far
too much time discuss this







ray do not throw the shrimp
you be going to choke again

choke to death you bore
bastard



the audience like you when
you be moving

yes
try not to stay in one
place too long
get outside as
much as you can

also we have some notion
have
you think about becoming a big
brother

that be too much glue
you be
use too much glue


do you still have it

no
ray sit on it
i see you



let we hear from we guest
panelist
you have expressed some
interesting thought on this
subject
what do you see as the
meaning if there be any of ed
john

i feel that ed be the apotheosis
of a prevailing american
syndrome
it used to be that
someone become famous because
they be special
now people
be considered special just for
be famous
fame itself be
now a moral good in this country
it be it own virtue

i be ed little league coach
he have no coordination
the big
game he strike cut with the
base loaded
then he cry like
a woman
it be sickening


i be he third grade teacher
i said take he for test
there be something wrong with
he
they do not listen


he used to steal thing from i
store
at least i think it be
he
yeah it be probably he



hey look i just fell off a
table



okay be that funny

how be that
be that funny



of more concern than the sag in
ed rating be what viewer be
feeling about he now
the
positive be down and the
negative be up
there be a feel that ed be not
cool anymore
we be starting to
see a big


hm



loser factor

that be deadly
McILVAINE
not necessarily
i mean instead
of running from the

run
with it
create more moment
like the table thing
we can
package a video ed Goofiest
moment
let he be americas
Goofball

be not this get kind of
pathetic
i mean we drink the
juice now we be just licking
peel
let it go

cynthia i think you be laboring
under a misconception
you seem
to believe that because you
happen to predict this we
should be impress
we be not
anybody in any business can
predict failure
need people
who prevent failure
i want to
see this thing turned back in the
right direction
remember this
be you baby



i do not know i still love this guy

yeah only i wish they have the
sister on more

ooh the sister
she be hot

you know it

ignore he

i can not
it be like a mudslide
scream out the
window
put on a shirt

i support the fact that you
exercise but for the love of
god put on a shirt

shut the curtain

no
let he shut the curtain



this joma be so phoney
i mean
those thing be not really
happening
i think they have
writer making that stuff up for
he
hey could not we do that
hire some writer and have they
write up some crazy situation i
could get into

ed everything go off
cheers go off
mash go off
