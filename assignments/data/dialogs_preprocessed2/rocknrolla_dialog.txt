advise

they say it be only going one way


and the be here looking at the build it
be a bit dilapidated and bleak

it look like a great deal


we cut back into the office where the lay out the
build plan

these be the plan
it cost ten
and it will be worth twenty with
planning
but first you get to give
the councilor a drink

like shit through a goose




we need help

lenny cole

dog number one

but he move fast and he love brick
and mortar



i do move fast and i love brick and
mortar property be always the
safe bet but you well know what
you be do cos this be not soft
money
you trip up
and it be not i that be going to get
hurt

come on then give we you hand




can not talk now but there have be a
problem
i can not get you the
planning



i be sorry boy can not get the
planning



he can not get the planing

he can not get the planing



what do you mean you can not get the
fuckin planning
there be seven million of i cash in
there without planning it be worth
five
you owe i
i take the
build you lose you share but i
be still outta pocket two large one
find it




be that you Councilor
i hear you get that car you be
after
now sort the planning
out



sort lenny

what be wrong with you arch
