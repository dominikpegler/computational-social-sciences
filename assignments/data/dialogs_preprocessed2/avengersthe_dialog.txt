we have a lead to wonderland
weather but we get there too late
someone tip they off

too late anyway
todays escapade
be only for starter
this be no
ordinary weather
it be manmade

kind of weather bomb

impossible

not quite
this be i field

be there anything that be not

the prospero project be start by
i husband
it be an early attempt
to solve the problem of global warming
in theory climate engineering be entirely
feasible
we think of inject a
chemical cocktail into the atmosphere
by laser and satellite
quick fixe

filling in mother nature blind
spot


exactly
there would be early attempt
to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea
propane gas mostly
in small quantity
it capture chlorine
protect the ozone
layer
but it prove impractical
too bulky

but if someone miniaturize the
process

that be what we be working on

sound as if someone hijack
you research

would it be possible to use it for
military purpose

direct by laser
bounce by
satellite
quite possible

where would they aim for

london
the world council of minister
meet soon on global defence
if you can
control the weather you control the world

after the cold war

the hot and cold war





new order
the penultimate phase
now fully operational



we be not yet open for business
i be afraid

shame
i be recommended

that

the death of peter peel be a
great loss
to we all

to you


i think you owe mrs

explanation

peter peel be a first class agent

be for you
for this
and the
accident

it be no accident

the official investigation

be written by i
it be sabotage mrs
peel

who

quite frankly
it could have
be you

you be accusing mrs
peel of
killing she own husband

she husband suspected someone very
close to the operation
on the day he
die he be setting a test
to prove to himself to we that he
wife be beyond suspicion
he have to
be certain
he said he be going to
give mrs
peel something

i want you to remember

peter give you anything onthat
day



no


he said if it vanished he would know
it be
you who betrayed he
he take a huge risk
the ultimate
test

so i be still

under suspicion
everyone die in
the explosion mrs
peel
you be
the only survivor

this be an official matter mrs
peel
no need to take it
personally
where be you going

people expect weather to be free
they be used to it
i call that a
denial of freedom
no freedom of
choice
an abuse of human right
they buy water electricity gas
why should not they be able to buy
they own weather if they want to
if they have a little incentive

such as

destruction of they local weather
system
i can zap a thousand
chernobyls into the air

the result would be

chaos
transport paralysis
crop
failure
economic disaster
frostbite or sunburn
on a
massive scale
you have see a few sample

then what be stopping you

you as dr
darling
as myself i will
be a bit less subtle

with this ring i plan will be
complete

how wagnerian
do you mean
to say you have wait all these
year because you could not create
a chip on you own
that would
have amuse peter

speaking of peter there be more good
news
