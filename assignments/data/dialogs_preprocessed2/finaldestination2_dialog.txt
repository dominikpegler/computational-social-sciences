i
can not even tell you some of the
thing i th ought about

i used to have those feeling too
but that be when i would think of mom
she strength
and courage
and
i would pray that maybe i would grow up to
be as brave as she be
and the
bad thought would go away


i do not know what i would do if i lost
you

at the request of the patient
you be to relinquish any sharp
object such as nail file
pencil pen safety pin bobby
pin no match lighter belt
belt buckle earring choker
shoelace

paper clip watch food
drink key poison pill and
medication

dangerous or
something

jesus how long be you going to
keep she locked up this way

depend on she i guess
she be
voluntary

clear river

kimberly burroughs eh
what do
you want

i think
i think you might be
able to help i

yeah how

i have a premonition about the route
pile up

i saved some people
and now i think death be after i

nice work
maybe if you be real
lucky you will wind up in here with
i
give kimberly the once
over
but i doubt you will survive that
long

it be not just about i
someone i
saved die last night in a freak
accident
what if the other be
in danger too

well if you put they on the list
they be already tit up

what list

death list
the precise order
you be going to die in

the survivor of flight die in
the exact order they be
originally mean to die in the
plane crash
that be death
original design

exact order
then i be next
i be
mean to die with i friend so
i be next

but you said someone else die last
night
that mean death skip
past you
someone must have
intervene
sometime yesterday you must have
nearly die but someone saved you

officer burke pulled i away from
the crash that killed i friend

Congratufuckinglations
that make
you last to go
but do not worry
once the other be dead it will
come back for you
always do

that still do not make sense
you
said you die in the same order you
be originally mean to
but evan
Shaeffer die last in i
premonition not first

it be moving backwards
be you
sure

yes
in i premonition that nora
woman and she kid die first then
evan and then
i friend

backwards
that be new

that be good
get all you tear
out now you will need you eye
for the sign

sign

if you have the same power as alex
you will be seeing sign soon
when
you see anything creepy or ominous
an inyour face irony kinda thing
do not ignore it
it usually mean
the difference between life and
death

the song on the radio
but wait
i do not understand
why
be this even happening to i

that be what alex used to ask
himself right up until

it be obvious you know what you be
talking about
you beat it
you
have to help we

i do not beat it
i hide from it
if you be smart you would put a down
payment on a burial plot and say
goodbye to the dog because what
little life you have left be over
as you know it
do not make new
friend do not fall in love and
do not ever bother trying to save
other
that be the bad killer of
they all

how can you say that
what kind of
monster be you

i family be dead
i friend be
dead
and alex

and yes that be the blade of a
fuck ceiling fan in he head

know what
i think you be a
coward
i think you hide out in
here because you be too damn bitter
and selfish to care about another
live soul
in i opinion you be
already dead

i tried calling last night but you
father

evan Shaeffers dead

i know
i have get call all
morning from everyone who be on
the onramp

i hope we would get
there and they would be okay that
clear river be full of shit and
evans death be just a freak
accident

but we be all going to die
we
can not stop it
it be just a matter
of time
i be so scare

fear

instinct

sign

able to sav e the other

ClearThomas
ThomasClear

the second one just die

year old kid

nod
a faint trace of
guilt
i hope you be ready for this

this be cheery

who be this guy anyway

mortician
he seem to know a
hell of a lot more about death than
he ever told we

should we knock

he probably already know we be
coming

hello clear
i have be keeping an
eye out for you

oh i god
that be evan Shaeffer

come to
pick i brain

flesh and bone require
degree for cremation
gold
prosthetic and other metal must
be remove before the final

not falling for this
again
just a simple question and we will
leave you alone with you new
friend

fire away

how do you cheat death once and for
all

dead
but still fresh

look we drive a long way to get
here
so if you happen to know how
to get this death monkey off we
back it sure would be swell if
you told we

for what purpose
you seek a back
way out of a room with but one
door
you can not cheat death
there
be no escape

bullshit
you told i death have a
distinct design a blueprint
unalterable
but alex and i
cheat death not once but dozens
of time
if the design be flawed
it can be beaten

such fire in you now
people be
always most alive just before they
die
do not you think

it can be beaten
and you know it

some say that there be a balance to
everything
an equilibrium that be
the connective tissue of the
universe
they say that for every
lif e there be a death and for
every death a life

solus novus anima licet evinco
mortis
only new life can defeat
death
the list of life be forever set by
the divine plan the guiding hand
that plot the course of the
universe down to it tiny
element s

the list account for every life
from the dawn of man to the great
apocalypse
but the introduction
of life that be not mean to be a
soul forbid to roam the earth
that could invalidate death list
shatter it very existence

what the hell do that mean

to figure that out you will have to
follow the sign s

but be warn
to disrupt the
grand design be to unravel the
tapestry of the universe
when you
pull all the thread apart you may
find yourself hanging from they

one last question
why be death
working backwards this time

shake head
a sick
smile
sorry time up

new life defeat death
follow the
sign
where the hell do you find
that guy

yeah i think he be suppose to
be helpful

he be
if we can use you ability
to see the sign we can cheat
death long enough to figure out
what new life means
i know it worry i that i
understand he

what the fuck be you think

i be thinkin suck i junk bee
yatch

what be it
what do you see

you have to tell we now

i
i

you be strong
do you hear i
you be a fuck warrior
nothing
scare you
in fact you happen to
be the single most powerful woman
on earth
now what do you see

i be driving a white van
it
must have go out of control because
it crashed into a lake and i
drowned
it be
horrible

you be there

i can practically taste the water
in i throat
and something else
the smell of flower

then it be not just a sign
it be
a premonition

remember the onramp
there be a
pregnant woman in a white delivery
van

holy shit
he said only new life
can defeat death

if she give birth to a baby that
be never mean to be born a brand
new soul that be never part of
death design

it throw the entire death list out
of whack
and a new list have to be
rewrite f rom scratch
we all
start over with a clean slate

it sound all well and good but
what if we be wrong

please what else could it mean

so if you give we the pregnant
lady number we can warn she
about the lake and she will live long
enough to have the baby

so let we do it

shit i do not have she number
she
be never interview
she take
off right after the accident

how be we going to find she
there must be thousands of white
van in this state

hey i be a police officer

few mile up the road
near the
dock

give i the key to you truck
now


anything you want
anything
i
wish i know
i do not

hurry up
there be no time
she be
about to give birth

what be you do
you be going
to kill we

no
if anyone die from a crash
now it will be i
but i can not die
if eugene and isabella be still
alive
i be last on death list

be you crazy
what make you
think you would survive

what happen when eugene tried to
kill himself out of turn

six dud in a row

that branch fell and saved i life
you be right death maintain
the order

let we pray that Isabellas still

now could someone please find the
open window and fucking close it

this make no sense
isabella be

lake
could we have altered she
destiny when we have she arrested

i do not think so
Alexs
premonition happen exactly as he
see they no matter how much we
tried to change it

then the only way to survive be to
get to the hospital and protect
eugene and isabella for as long as

if only alex and i have do that
with the other alex might still
be
