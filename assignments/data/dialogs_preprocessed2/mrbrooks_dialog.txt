what be wrong with i
what be
wrong with i
what be wrong with
i


do you choose they because of
where they live or how they look
or what job they have
or do you
just pick they because at the
instant you see they you have
decided to kill someone
the side
door be perfect
no one could see
you pick the lock

how do you know where they be in
the house

it be dark tonight than it be on
you night
but still how do you
manage not to bump into the
furniture
do you have a little
light
that would be too dangerous
i will bet you be in the house
before


so i should ask the neighbor if
they see a meter reader around the
house or a telephone repairman or
someone from the gas company

once again how do you know where
they be
do you check the room
before you find they
she have he
semen in she vagina they have just
make love do you hear they or be
there a light on

and when do you bag the gun
because even though i be sure you be
an expert at it there be still a
chance of noise from the plastic

be the door open or do you have
to open it

be they asleep or awake
be the
light on or do you turn it on
because i know you you would not
risk a shot in the dark

too bright
what if it be not that
light that be on but this one


that be good
what thrill do you
get by killing people
be it
sexual be it hate be it power
do
you feel remorse
probably that
part of you brain do not exist
do you have emotion of love or
affection or joy
or have you
learned to fake they so you will not
stand out in a crowd

what if these be stick close
because you yank they closed
which mean they be open when you
come into the room

if mr
and miss normal make love
with the curtain open and the
light on someone in that build
notice they and may have see you

be that what you be angry about



thank you for you time



oh
you scare i

i be sorry
bend down and pick up
the envelope
i be about to knock
i be

the pickup or the owner they may
not be the same

i give he i driver license
i student he do not look

never check


i do something like that except i
be the one who take the test
it
be not math a friend of mine be a
theology major and needed a second
language to get into the master
program

she start she career in theology
with a lie

base on

do you pass the test

oh yeah

do not tell i she end up as
mother teresa or the pope

successful

she stay in religion

goodnight



i think that be right
go back




we be in



with the tax we pay you would think
they could make it more difficult
to hack into the police personnel
file



huh
she father gerald
atwood why do that ring a bell

someone you do business with
someone we killed


not someone we killed

college of william and mary
she be be a cop for eleven
year
married doctor carlson
divorced dr
carlson married jesse
Vialo
restaurateur
separated
from jesse Vialo sue for support
by jesse Vialo seeing a shrink
because of jesse Vialo

excellent fitness report though


she caught the hangman the guy
that escaped the other day

oooh
she be catch a lot of
people
and look here this be not
the first time she be be hunting
for we


i wonder what the deal be with she
and jesse Vialo



ahhhh
now i remember
she
father gerald atwood never do
business with he but emma and i
meet he a couple time big
political fundraiser
he own or
owned one of the large insurance
group in the country and a lot of
other stuff


jesse Vialo
good looking a
little young than she be

young restaurateur
she married he on the rebound from
the doctor and i will bet he marry
she for she money and she
connection


the old man be rich do not mean
she be rich
maybe he be one of those
guy who would rather give it to
the opera than to he kid

would not she have to declare any
outside income and holding to the
police


hmmm


the opera do not get much

why would a woman with she
education and worth plus million
dollar and probably more to come
want to be a cop


i like that about she


you be such a fuck snob earl
you like she because she be rich


no i like she because she find
something that be hers
it be not the
family business
and she be good at
it
i would like jane to find something
that be hers and that she could be
good at

that be exactly why atwood scare
the shit out of i
she be a cop who
do not need the money and she be
looking for we

dangerous human being

do jane ever tell you that there
be a murder at she school

clifford it be a pleasure
thank you for coming on such short
notice

there will not be any more dropping by
like they do today they will call
we first


thanks again roger
it be a good
idea to hear what they wanted to
know sooner rather than later


we will talk


yup



you do good kid
you answer
be clear concise and honest
and
when they tried to trip you up it
do not work

i hope so
i be not feeling so well

should you lie down

i think i would well


try and get some sleep


i think roger have a handle on this
he and mr
clifford will take care
of it

i be sorry i do not tell you about
it daddy
it be horrible but i
really do not know the guy that
well
it happen at about the same
time i find out i be pregnant
and it just go out of i mind


i understand






god grant i the serenity to accept
the thing i cannot change courage
to change the thing i can and
wisdom to know the difference


god help i
what do i do

she do it do not she


yeah
it will take the cop a week to
ten day to put they case together
and then they will come back and
arrest she

what be you going to do


i have be afraid of this since the
day she be born
she have what i
have

yes she do
but you have always
be smart about it
she be
stupid
she do it because she get
off on it she do it for fun
why
do not she think it through

hatchet
and she left it there


they be pretty graphic be not
they

that be to shock she into making a
mistake



what do she think i think
do not she remember what she told
i
that the be be driven
across country by a friend and now
right in front of i she tell the
cop it be stolen

you have always cleaned up after she
whatever she do all she life


if the have anything
incriminate in it i hope it be
steal or she drop it at the
bottom of a very deep lake

do you think she know what kind of
trouble she be in


i think she think she have get
away with it until the cop show
up
i should have listen to she
it be there
she be telling i
i do not quit school because i be
pregnant
i should have dig
deeper

and where would you be but at the
exact same place you be now
it be
not you fault earl
part of you
problem with she be that you always
think it be


she have what i have marshall
so
on a very basic level it be i
fault

what be you going to do


maybe the good thing for she would
be to let she go to jail

and what about she child



emma and i would raise it

you might be right earl you might
be
because you know if she be not
stopped she be going to do it
again
and if she want to take
over the box business the next
victim could be you


i do not think she would go that far



we find trace of this in two
place

here and here

we do an analysis and it be make up
of feldspar alumina and kaolin

what be that

high fire stoneware clay

like you make ashtray and vase
from


this be more plate and teacup
it
be slightly wet when whoever it
be track it into the house and
it stick to the carpet fiber
we be think it be the killer

it could have be track in by a
friend

that be the thing you see the
friend would have have to have be
there almost at the same time the
killer be
otherwise the sample
would have be dry and the killer
would have vacuume they up

be the clay rare be it difficult
to get

you can buy it almost anywhere

that be not much help Sigy

and this be the only incongruity
you be able to find in the whole
house

we have do everything we know how
to do
it sure do not break the
case wide open do it

no Sigy it do not
it do give
i an excuse to ask someone some
new question

yes mr
brooks


before you open you mouth be very
sure this be the right thing to do


i will never be sure

you get piss at i because i be
always the one argue to go ahead
and do murder
not this time earl
this be you decision


i know it be wrong
in i heart i
know it be wrong

then do not do it
go with mr
smith
tonight and end that then let the
police put jane in jail
hopefully
that will save she and we can
happily go on with we torture
live


that be exactly what i want to do
that be exactly what i should do
the thing be she be i daughter and
i love she


i be going home
cancel everything
for the rest of the day
i might be
in tomorrow afternoon
i will let you
know about that

i will take care of it


if you need i need i call i
studio that be where i will be



i probably will not pick up just
leave a message

i will try not to bother you

the thing that bother i about
this besides the fact we be not
prepare and a multitude of other
thing be what do mr
smith do
when he be walking west tonight and
you do not show up
that little
freak could flip out


i will take care of it on the way to
the airport





not able to meet




tonight do it same




time tomorrow


night do not be stupid


fuck you


you remember i

would you step out of the car
please i want to talk to you

so mr
Baffert what be that you
have to tell i


what do you mean
i do not have
anything to tell you

really
because i be driving
around and i get this sudden
feeling that you have something to
tell i about the murder


no
nothing

that be disappoint
because when
i left you the last time we talk
i feel i have missed a clue that be
right in front of i that would
solve this whole case


i do not know why you would feel
that

do not you tell i you be an
amateur potter that you make bowl
and vase



no i said i be an amateur
photographer

be you positive
because we find
potter clay on the carpet of the
murder house and i be sure you
said to i that you worked with
clay that you make pot


no
i said i hobby be
photography not pottery

maybe that be it
the stewardess
upstairs said the victim keep
they curtain open when they make
love
could i see some of the
picture you take of that couple




do not be stupid


you be harass i detective
atwood
you know very well i be not
a potter and i do not have any
picture
so i feel be that
you feel be wrong and that you
should move you car and let i go
home

what be you job here
what do you
do



i be a mechanical engineer

you have to be pretty smart for
that do not you


i guess

then be smart mr
Baffert

lie to i right there at the end
i will be watch you
and when you
want to tell i the truth you know
how to get in touch with i

frustrated
Goddamit

something
meaning mr
smith
he almost told i and then
something happen

you think he do it

i do not think it be that simple


here you be sir


thank you


god grant i the serenity to accept
the thing i cannot change courage
to change the thing i can and
wisdom to know the difference


you be awfully quiet back there




mr
alvin griffin this be the
chicago police

we have a warrant to search you
home and premise
we be coming in

light do not work


call to the darkness in
back of she
we have a dead woman in here

hey

i think you be behind i

the live room be clean


snyder meet mona

i called it in

do that outside

to snyder re
the body
meeks do this

i think meeks hung people

meeks be a steroid freak
this
refrigerator be always full of
steroid
mona be alvin griffin
niece receptionist lover and
keeper of the key

the house



snyder this be alvin griffin


how do you feel


dirty

that be understandable
you have never
killed for this reason before
the
feel will go away


i do not think so
it be the whole
thing marshall
if i could find a
way to just disappear where there
be absolutely no trace of i
because eventually i will get
caught do this
and it will be
very embarrass for i and emma
and jane
so i have be think
be there a way that mr
smith could
kill i and make i disappear

number one mr
smith be not smart
enough to do that
number two
there be no reason if you be
careful to believe you will ever
get catch


i know i will have to plan it for
mr
smith but i think that be what
i want to do

i be not particularly fond of that
plan earl
remember if you die i
go with you and i like be alive
i like eating i like fucking i
like kill



i have to end it marshall
one way
or the other

the good way

an hour mr
smith if you shoot i
now there be a good chance we will
both die



not now
take the next off ramp


that would not be very smart of i
would it


think about this
you pissed
yourself back there you left you
at the scene of a double
homicide and there be nothing to
indicate that i be ever there
if
the cop do an analysis of that
urine and they will you be the
thumbprint killer

second murder


let i help you with a thought
you
say i forced you to come along and
if i be not here or more
specifically i body be not here to
say different you might have a
chance to beat the rap
now you be
probably asking yourself why i
would help you
i be tire mr
smith i be tire of kill
but
i be an addict i can not quit
i have
tried
i can not do it on i own
so
i will let you kill i but i want you
to do it smart in a way that i

find an open grave you shoot i i
fall in the grave you shovel in
just enough earth to cover i
tomorrow a casket be lowered onto
i and i have disappeared
it be a
good plan

you be
the man holding the gun you see i
put mine in the trunk


i do not know
you really want i to
kill you


yes

climb over do you


what be you do with a key to a
cemetery

you always want to invest in thing
people can not do without
water and
cemetery be pretty safe



you will need this to get out
now
there should be an open grave
around here somewhere
let we see if
we can find it


meeks


atwood

come on down there be something i
want to show you


there we be
now if i stand
here


and you stand there not too
far away and you shoot i i should
fall straight back into the hole

do this do you


i be hope you do


okay let we get this over with


i will close i eye

for you so you could finish i if i
have decided to go through with it

much i want to see the end to that
story
