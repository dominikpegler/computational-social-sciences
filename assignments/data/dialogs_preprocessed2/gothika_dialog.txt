negative for undergo
extensive hypnosis and received
amytal injection

well
how to put this

you have be pretty much catatonic
this be the first time you speak

doug must be worried sick
i need
to call he

you be the most logical person i
know bar none
plus you have a
photographic memory unconfirmed
but you do remember event and
phrase more accurately than anyone
around
why be i telling you this

you be establishing i personality
as fairly intellectual you do not
consider i impulsive or emotional

and that be a fair assessment no

yes that be fair
and follow
this pattern of analysis we be
about to discuss a traumatic event
that render this psychological
profile useless correct


two hundred percent

you think i be in denial
that i be
putting on a brave show that
this be a cover for some
unbearable emotion i be hide
why

do not analyze yourself just focus
on remembering

i remember friday night after
work if you say that be five
day ago

do for the weekend and you said
the usual and you make a joke
about writing country song and
drink yourself to sleep and i

method or be you refer to
the nature of you past

hi

she be due back in the rec room in
twenty Counselor

thank you kindly


teddy i know you know doug well
and this be an extremely

i be here as you lawyer
so
whatever i relationship be with
doug be no long of consequence
first thing first how be they
treat you

like i be crazy

you know this place good than
anyone
anything out of the
ordinary

other than i be crazy
no

the be pushing for a hear as
soon as next week
they be eager
to resolve this situation because
well crime like this do not
happen that often around here
doug be a hometown boy who do
good beloved high school
principal a role model
we good
shot scratch that we only
shot be to claim temporary
insanity

wait wait wait teddy you
know i
i would not raise a hand
at i husband for the life of i
not even in selfdefense
be not
it remotely possible a burglar
broke in or some crazed high
school student attack doug and i
go into shock

you be telling i there be no other
suspect in anyone mind


frankly no
neighbors hear
scream
they have you at the
scene they have the murder weapon
and they have you print everywhere
the only thing they do not have be
motive

because there be no motive

and that be what be confuse they
the fact that you be a brilliant
psychiatrist do not help either
it fill they head with idea
they figure if you be to plan a
murder you might know how to fake
insanity to get out of it

i be not fake anything

good
i pass no judgment either
way
the point be

the point be i be the only person
who do not believe i killed i
husband
i never think i would say
this but i feel like i be in the
middle of a conspiracy
do you believe i be crazy


it do not matter what i believe

forget it
forget i ask

i can not help you if you do not talk
to i

i can stand here all day
all
week
you be the one running out
of time

then who

you be going to have to trust i

why

because no matter what be going
through you mind right now i
have not do anything wrong


then you know exactly how i feel

you admit you be have a hard
time differentiating what be
reality from what be hallucination
right
so be not it at least
possible that

as a doctor i agree with you
maybe and this be a big maybe
all of this be just a deep
epilepsy that extend to the
limbic structure but i be telling
you

how about this moment right now

what about it

be this a hallucination

you tell i
but i do know what i
sound like
paranoia be the
ultimate awareness right

which be why i suggest we simply
increase you dose until

can pretend that do not just
happen

bring an XActo knife into the
shower to do this would not i

way she could not speak but she
be extremely bright
she be not
autistic as the doctor claim

mrs

session with i but as you can
see

every night the same box in she
hand and the same number

hood put the big bad wolf in a
coma

be they

you be not scare of a bunch of
woman now be you officer

we will be right outside doctor


i pulled a lot of string to get
you transferred back
the good
case scenario you be looking at
right now be five year here
five
under i

peter i do not believe in ghost
before this
and neither do you

but you know that the brain be
fully capable of trick you into
seeing all sort of thing
the
simple chemical deficiency
can

chemical deficiency can not get
inside of you and make you do
terrible thing you do not remember
do

i be a very openmind person but
as a doctor

no you be not
you be a close
minded academic just like i
you told i once that i be the
most logical person you know
remember
well everything that be
happen have an explanation but it
have nothing to do with psychiatry
or science
rachel parsons be
abducted and she be murdered six
year ago toss off the ashley
bridge by i husband
i
harmless righteous community
leader husband that be how
pathetically blind i have be


andrea white and jenny dixon be
also abducted and murdered now
this be before i meet doug but i
bet you anything that they both
go to he school
then he
obviously stopped for a while
fear guilt distraction
namely i delayed he from
revert to he sickness
that be
why i do not notice anything
i
believe he really tried to lead a
normal life for i
then along
come tracy Seaver and he can not
resist
lock she up and torture
she in some abandoned property

here Dougs interest in real
estate pete

rachel parsons be a pissedoff
ghost with an agenda furious at
she parent for giving up on
she she be be trying to
communicate with they for year
but they be too goddamn logical to
pay attention and she picked
i she sought i out that night
and send i home to fix she
problem
make sure i killed doug
because he be going to do the
same thing to tracy Seaver as he
do to she
and she will get rid
of anyone who stand in she way

be that a threat

to whom

to i


to you
i be telling you she
nearly electrocute i when i
tried to leave town and she lead i
to that barn and if i do not do
what she want she be going to
kill i

i need you to at least consider
the possibility that i be not
insane
beat
plead
not as a doctor
as the only
person i trust in this world

i be not do it for miranda i be
do this for rachel

you be making a complete fool of
yourself
do you realize what you
sound like

what do i sound like phil
like
one of you patient
well it be
probably because that be exactly
how you treat i
and i have have
enough of this deafen silence
between we this exemplary
mourning in front of the
community tiptoe around we
life with you pretend rachel
never exist

not finished with you yet

i be sure that be mean to sound
comfort but

she want to show you something

you get it anyplace it come from
egg you pour it all over

you think i and doug be
monster
that this be all a
carefully laid out plan with those
girl
but it be not that at all
you do thing sometimes and you be
not sure why you do they
then
you realize you can live with they
and so can everyone else
life
go on

if you be looking for forgiveness
you come to the wrong place

one thing about fear be it make
people say the dumb thing


be that as it may you be afraid
too because you know killing i
will not solve you problem

i only problem be you

what about parsons
and peter
they know
and that girl in the
hospital will never forget you
face
you miscalculate now you
pay

i hate a bad bluff

i sure hope that feel good because
you can not afford too many more
sign of struggle
can you

go ahead hit i back
it be what
you want

no that be what you want i to do

back to profile huh
you
thought process be completely
transparent

so we be even
you left that door
open so i would try and run it be what
you get off on be not it

i guess we will find out


and yet you have to make i look
like a suicide
with what you
belt
how would i get access to a belt

trust i prisoner hang themselves
with just about anything

i do not think that be going to
satisfy you
you will not be able to
do this clean
you have too much
guilt inside

you be losing grasp of the
situation
it be different with
those girl
i bet all they do
be cry and scream

do not worry you will scream
take off you shirt

be not i a little old for you

take it off

that be for show
you know you
can not shoot i

but i can smash you tooth out and
make it look like you bash you
head against the wall
now shut
up take off you goddamn shirt
and pull off you bra


today doctor




doug mention you be painfully
modest
but enough about you
let we discuss rachel



she be no cripple saint
be not
the first time she turned up at
Dougs house all mess up


sure she be a minor but she
be not going to let that get in
she way

rachel where be you when i need
you



those other girl make no
mistake they know what they
be get into

i be not saying they know they be
going to die but truth be doug and
i do not know it be going to end that
way
it be just the natural extension
of that moment
so yeah we fuck
they and we killed they
and we know
it be wrong
sure we do


it be not some satanic pact
society do not make we do it
but
i believe given the proper
circumstance a person be capable
of anything certainly in i
line of work you see it day in
day out
tell you what keep the shirt
the bra will do

chin up doctor
you wanted to
get to the bottom of this and you
do
you follow it all the way
through
this be how it end

doug settled down once you two get
marry
new start and all that
want nothing to do with this
runaway i would find tracy Seaver

or so he claimed
because the
truth doc be people never
change
the son of a bitch
could not resist
i ask he to
dump the body and instead he go
find some barn to work she out of
he system some more
go fucking
figure


you can not count on anyone even
friend you have have you whole
life

the only soul you can ever count
on be yourself

why doctor
that be unexpected

you sure about this

you need i alive for you story
to stick
be logical now
you
know you can not kill i

logic be overrate

discovery that it be he who
murdered i late husband
i wish
i could personally thank certain
people for they convincing
testimony in the case



as for myself i have a new name
now and a job working with teenage
girl at a runaway shelter trying
to keep an open mind at the
horror they tell i



which remind i
consuelo the
cuban witch be a keeper do not
fire she
she know thing about
the world you and i do not




well get to run now i have some
country song to write and lots of
social invite to decline





and in case you be wonder
what the chance be of i buying
you a beer and maybe finishing
something we almost start the
answer be
it be just not going to
happen

should not bother showing up
all
i love
