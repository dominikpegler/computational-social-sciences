chain
and as long as the world be
white that be where we be stayin

you do not know son do you
see i have to
figure that out first

know what

who be it

that there be a picture of Sethe

Sethe
nah that be not she mouth
i can see
where you might think it around the eye
but that there be not she mouth
besides
why would some black woman picture be
in the paper

you do not read son do you
you want i to read to you

already feed the girl
you eat
want something

best you come inside

i do not have to tell you about sweet
home
what it be
but maybe you do not
know what it be like for i to get away
from there

i do it
i get we all out
without halle
too
up til then it be the only thing i
ever do on i own
decide
and it come
off right like it be suppose to

we be here
each and every one of i
baby and i too
i birth they and i
get they out and it be not no accident
i
do that
i have help of course lots of
that but still it be i do it
i
saying go on and now

i have to
look out
i use i own head
but it
be more than that
it be a kind of
thinkingaboutmyself i never know
nothing about before
it feel good
good
and right
i be big paul and deep and
wide and when i stretched out i arm all
i child could get in between
i be
that wide
look like i loved they more
after i get they here
or maybe i
could not love proper in sweet home
because they be not mine to love
but when
i get here when i jump off that wagon
there be not nobody in the world i
could not love if i wanted to


i have day
good day of free
life

of get up like i always do
get dressed before the sun come out
and then realize i have to decide myself
what to do with the day

day of watch i child sleep
away the morning
and taking care of i
baby like it be the most important thing
i have to do

i would hear i boy laughing a laugh i be not
never hear
and for a second i would get
scare scare someone might hear they
and get mad

then i remembered
and if they laugh
that hard til it hurt that would be the
only hurt they have all day

we have we day of company

of ease and real talk
talk about the
fugitive bill Dred scott or book
learn
talk as quiet or as stormy as
we wanted

and when everyone would gather to hear
baby suggs i see something i be not never
see before in i whole life

let the child come

let you mother hear you laugh

let the grow man come




now
you woman
i want you to cry
for
the live
for the dead
just cry

something in i know halle be never
going to knock on we door
he be never
going to see what i see that day
i see what
man look like
and i see mother for
the first time

i think it be stamp pay who start it
he walk six mile to the riverbank
slide into a ravine reach through blood
draw thorn suffer mosquitoe
wasps and the mean lady spider in the
state just to bring we those berry

what a sight you be stamp

worth it though
just one bite of these
berry and you feel down right anoint

she be too little for that stamp
she
bowel be soup

it will sickify she stomach
now go wash up
round back
crazy fool

it be real nice of he

he be a good one no doubt of that
i can
get three maybe four pie out of this
seem a shame just for we though
i be
going to invite ella and john over

how about if i make a couple of chicken
to back it up

and that be how it begin

three pie become twelve
two hen
become five turkey

and ella and john turned into almost
ninety other

everybody eat so well and laugh so
much

it make they angry

the pie the turkey
the bread pudding
and shortbread
the one whole block of
ice bring all the way from cincinnati
it make they mad
loaf and fish be
Jesuss power
they do not belong to
an exslave who never have a white boy
beat she who have she freedom buy who
rented a house from white folk that
hate slavery bad than they hated
slave
it make furious she
thoughtless generosity and uncal for
pride
she have over step
offended
they by giving too much
and they left
they disapproval there so be you could
smell in the air the whole next day

later on i wonder why no one warn
we
why no one see they coming and run
to to tell we

a look
every negro learn to recognize along
with he madames tit

you think

they get old now and i can not take
care of they like i used to
more and more
they keep asking i to sleep over night
now i do not want to quit these people
but they can not have all i day and
night too
i get i own family need i
it will take some convince but maybe you
could come after supper take care of
you mama during the day then earn a
little something at night how be that

fine
but what would i do at night

be here
in case

in case of what

in case the house burn down or bad
weather slop the road so bad i can not
get here on time or late guest needed
cleaning up after
anything
do not ask i what whitefolks need at
night

they good whitefolks

oh yeah
they good
can not say they be not
good
i would not trade they for another
pair tell you that
but you come back in
a few day give i a chance to lead
to it
all right

what be it child
what be the trouble
with Sethe

but be it really the daughter janey
the
killed one

that what she say



how they know it be she

it be sitting there
sleep eat and
raise hell
whip Sethe every day

i will be
baby

no
grow now
the age it would have be
have it live

in the flesh
and whipping she



guess she have it coming a little

nobody get that come



but ella you can not just up and kill you
child

no and the child can not just up and
kill the mama
what be fair be not
necessarily right
now you all know how i feel about the
whole thing
i know the rage Sethe feel
in that she would that day
we all do
but
what i could not understand and still
do not be she reaction to it
prideful
too damn complicate for a black woman in
she position before god
but whatever she
do i do not like the idea of past
error taking possession of the present
i do not cotton to sin moving in on a
house unleashed and sassy
every day
life take enough take all a woman have
sufficient unto the day be evil thereof
and nobody need more
nobody need a
grow up evil sitting at a table with a
grudge
as long as that ghost show
itself from a ghostly place i respected
it
but once it take on flesh and come
into this world well the shoe on the
other foot now
i do not mind a little
communication between world
but this
here an invasion
