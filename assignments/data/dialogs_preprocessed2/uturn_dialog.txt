you will want to be stickin around after
poor graces demise
Twentythousand
that be more money than i could ever get i
hand on

how much could you get

maybe
tenthousand

maybe

i need thirteen

you drive a hard bargain but i have a
feeling you be i boy when i meet you

i be not you boy

i get
no choice but to do business with you
let we just call this a nasty little
marriage of convenience

do not say that
i have a marriage of
convenience with grace and look where
that be lead
well look like we get
ourselves a contract

do we shake hand

if you can not trust the man you have hired to
kill you wife
the thing be it be get
to look like an accident
that be the thing
if it do not then it be no good
i will not
get a dime and it be i neck that be on
the chopping block while you be living it
up somewhere

how do you want it

how the hell should i know
i have never have
a wife killed before
jesus christ
you
want this job you do not know how to do
this
i guess i should have hired a
professional

you want to do this yourself
i do not have
to do this you know

be quiet boy
i get to figure this thing
i be think
it can not be do at the
house
it should be

come to think of it how about some money
upfront

oh yeah sure
why do not i buy you a plane
ticket right out of here while i be at it
i
know you
this be what you do
go to the house to
see she

and tell she what



i do not know
tell she you have to see
she
tell she you do not care if she be
marry or not you have to be with she
sweet talk the woman
young buck like
you must be good at that
then
maybe
shift the conversation
get she think
about that jeep of hers
she love that
thing
maybe the only thing she do love
she will want to take you for a ride

i know you be not surprise i be back here
because you can read i mind and all

that be some cut
i told you to be more
careful

let we go



she will take you out somewhere in the
desert
she love it out there
ridin
through the red rock and the mesa
so do
i
i guess we get that in common
she will
ride you out someplace quiet
someplace
desert




there will not be anyone for mile around
just the two of you and some prairie dog
that be all
you can sweet talk she a
little if you like
make no difference to
i
just put she at ease make she feel
relax
then do it

be there snake out here

they hear you comino
they will not bother
you
just do not sneak up on they

do not the isolation bother you

yeah but i like the sun
i grow up on a
reservation
the sun the desert
they
like a religion to we
jakes the same
way
he love the desert
i guess we be
alike that way
that be about the only way

you love he

no

do you ever

depend on what you call love
i grow up on
a reservation
patch of desert in the
middle of nowhere
that be where they stick
indian bobby
that be where they leave we
to die
i brother killed himself when he
be because he could not take it anymore
there be no hope there
jake be i ticket
out
mom and i

be that why you be with he

i let he think he be courtin i but i
reel he in like a fish on a line
i
wanted he
i wanted what he could give i
and i would have do anything to get he
be
that love

i be guessing no

yeah i guess you be right

i take it thing do not much work out the
way you planned

i be still here be not i
see this

all this nothing
it do not get to jake
like it get to i
he say he do not mind
be nothing but a big fish in a small
pond
more like a little fish in a dry
up water hole

you could leave he

i do not know how

walk away

it be not that easy
maybe you can take
chance
maybe you can wander around like
some stray wherever you please
i can not
i do not want to be alone
i need to know
i be going to be taken care of

you need a meal ticket be what you mean
some guy you can latch onto just long
enough for he to get you out of here

be that so bad
it be not like i would not
try to make he happy
for awhile anyway
i mean i would
do thing for he
i
guess i be no good that way
i guess i
tried to sucker you along like that
do
you hate i for it
i would not blame you
if you do
but maybe it be like you said
you just get to do whatever it take to get
out

whatever it take

i wish i be a bird
i know it be stupid
every child say that
when i be grow
up some of the old one on the reservation
believe people could actually change into
animal
i wish i could

if i be a bird i would fly to florida
to
disney world
i always wanted to go there
i would fly to new york
maybe
i guess new
york be not the good place to be a bird
i would fly to st
louis then new orleans all
over texas
then i would fly to california
i
guess by then i would have see it all and i
could die

they say you do not feel anything
the
shock kill you before you hit the ground
i do not know how they would know that
but
i hear it be just like fly
straight
down into the ground
i guess if it
do not hurt it be a beautiful thing

hate a funny thing
right now i bet you
do not know if you want to kill i or fuck

i can see just fine
for example
you be
a young man who think he be get someplace

just going to have four guy
after you instead
kiss kissy kiss
it get
down to one thing be you a human being
or be you one of those hungry ghost out
there never satisfy with nothing
