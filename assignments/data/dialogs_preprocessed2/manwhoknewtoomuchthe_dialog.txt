you drink an aperitif with
he in you hotel room
and you eat

you

i meet he yesterday on the bus
for the first time in i life

and yet out of five thousand people
in a great market place he come to
you when he be about to die
be that
the action of a casual acquaintance
monsieur

i know nothing about louis bernard

no
not even i suppose that he be
an agent of the Deuxieme bureau

what be that

perhaps you have also never head of
the american

i
it would be so much more easy for both
of we monsieur if you would cease to
pretend

now look here

the dead man find out what he have
be send here to discover
that be
why he be killed
he told you what
he have discover
why
because he
