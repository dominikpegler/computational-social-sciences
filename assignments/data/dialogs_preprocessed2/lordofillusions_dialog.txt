but i
do not know you

i be in from new york
i come to
see swann

what a tragedy
it be just a
matter of time of course but it be
not good for the business

be he taking a lot of risk

you do not know the half of it
i be
walter wilder by the way

not the walter wilder

the one and only

want to try

you know Vinovich

sure
Vivovich

he know swann way back
he say
there be a lot of drug a lot of
crazy shit

i would love to
you know
hang
with some of you guy

people be pretty cagey
who do
you know

for what

for an introduction

well
nobody

you do now

i only wear tie for funeral

you do not get in without one
it be
like a gentleman club for
illusionist
except most of we
be not gentleman

be they all in the business

it be not a business
harry
it be a
vocation

that be what they call the
repository
every magic secret
known to mane locked up in that
room

have you be in

no
there be only three key
Vinovich have get one of
course
he be a little crazy by the way
and he be a mean drunk
otherwise
he be a real charmer


it be more than entertainment
we be
open people head up
put
miracle back into they bore
little live

but they be fake miracle

houdini believe he have spirit
guide

you believe that

i think we walk a narrow path
between
between

heaven and hell

trickery and divinity

be you saying that sometimes
the miracle be real

no
i be saying they be always
fake
the saint the messiah
they be just illusionist

so could you walk on water

i could reproduce any miracle
that be ever be perform with a
little preparation

what about Swanns miracle

they be not worth a damn

i hear he be the good

to keep i company

great accent by the way
be it
brooklyn

asshole but he be a powerful
asshole
