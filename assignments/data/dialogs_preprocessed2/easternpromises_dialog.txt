hallucination

it be good to have someone who i
can trust to do simple task

in this business sometimes the
big danger come from the most
stupid thing
you can not afford

spreading about i son

Kirill have he killed for nothing
important

i do not want to repeat it



for i you will repeat it

you play with the prince to do
business with the king
but if
you want to do business with i
you must be open with i
thief
inlaw

what be Soyka saying about the
prince

a queer

i only son

you know it never snow in this
city
