the klingon
do not take prisoner
captain

trainee to the brief room

physician heal thyself

that be all you have to say

i be not a drama critic

well mr
Saavik be you going
to stay with the sink ship

permission to speak candidly sir

very well

i do not believe this be a fair
test of i command capability

and why not

because
there be no way to win

nowin situation be a possibility
every commander may face
have that
never occur to you

no sir
it have not

how we deal with death be at least
as important as how we deal with
life would not you say

as i indicated admiral that
thought have not occur to i

then you have something new to think
about
carry on

would not it be easy to put
an experience crew back on the
ship

they will learn
gallop about the
cosmos be a game for the young
doctor

what be that suppose to mean



be not you dead

i assume you be loitering here
to learn what efficiency rate
i plan to give you cadet

i be understandably curious

they destroyed the simulator room
and you with it

the
Kobayshi maru
scenario
frequently wreak havoc with
student and equipment
as i recall you take the test
three time yourself
you final
solution be shall we say unique

it have the virtue of never have
be tried

yours be not a solution which
would have occur to a vulcan
mentality

so you said at the time
speaking
of which you protgs first
rare a trifle emotional

she be half romulan jim
the
admixture make she more volatile
than i for example

than you
yes i see that
by
the way thank you for this

i know of you fondness for antique

it be the good of time it be
the bad of time
message
spock

none of which i be consciously
aware except of course happy
birthday surely the good of time

Hrummm

this report classified
log entry by commander pavel chekov
duty officer
starship reliant
on orbital approach with ceti alpha
in connection with project code
name
we be continue
we search for a lifeless planet
which will serve as a suitable test
site for the genesis experiment
this be the th planet we have
visit so far no success



standard orbit mr
beach

standard orbit sir

any change in surface scan

negative
limit atmosphere
dominated by craylon gas sand and
high velocity wind
incapable
of support life form
ceti alpha

do it have to be
completely
lifeless

do not tell i you have get something

we have pick up a minor energy flux
reading on one dyno scanner

damn
be you sure
maybe the
scanner out of adjustment

i suppose it
could
be a particle
of preanimate matter catch in the
matrix

all right let we get on the Commpic to
doctor marcus
maybe it be something
we can transplant

you know what she will say

i

something you can transplant
i
do not know



it might only be a particle of
preanimate matter

then again it might not
you
boy have to be clear on this
there can not be so much as a
microbe or the show off
why do not you have a look
if it
something that can be moved

you bet doctor
we be on we way

i

how can you let they pull that
stuff on you
they be just lazy

khan

i do not know you

i never
forget a face
mister chekov
be not it
i never think to see you face
again

chekov who be this man

criminal captain a product of
the late th century genetic
engineering

what do you want with we
i demand

you be in a position to demand
nothing sir
i on the other hand
am in a position to grant nothing
what you see be all that remain of
the ship company and the crew of the
botany bay
marooned here fifteen
year ago by captain james
kirk

listen to i you man and woman

save you strength captain these
people have sworn to live and die at
i command two hundred year before
you be born
do you mean he
i
e
chekov
never told you the tale
to amuse you captain
never tell
you how the
enterprise
picked up the
botany bay
lost in space from the
year myself and the ship
company in cryogenic freeze

i have never even meet admiral kirk

admiral
he do not tell you how
admiral
kirk send seventy of we into
exile on this barren sand heap with
only the content of these cargo bay
to sustain we

you lie
on ceti alpha there be
life a fair chance to

this be ceti alpha
ceti alpha
exploded six month after we be
left here
the shock shifted the
orbit of
this
planet and everything
be laid waste
admiral
kirk never
bothered to check on we progress
it be only the fact of i genetically
engineer intellect that enable we
to survive
on earth two hundred
year ago i be a prince with power
over millions now like prometheus
i have be left by admiral kirk to
digest i own entrails

captain kirk be you host
you repay
he hospitality by trying to steal his
ship and murder he

and i will wager he never told you
about he shipmate the beautiful
and courageous lieutenant mcgiver
who give up everything to join i
in exile

and see how
admiral kirk
requit she devotion
she be dead as earth

plague upon you all

you do not expect to find i
you think this be ceti alpha
why be you here

why

no matter

you will soon tell i willingly
enough

let i introduce you to ceti alpha vs
only remain indigenous life form
what do you think
they have killed
twenty of i people including i
beloved wife
oh not all at once
and not instantly to be sure
they
young enter through the ear and wrap
themselves around the cerebral cortex
this have the effect of rendering the
victim
extremely
susceptible to
suggestion
later as they grow
follow madness paralysis and
death
these be pet of course
not
quite
domesticate

khan listen to i
captain kirk
be only do he duty
you


there be some pain at first i be
tell and then the effect be quite
benign until the end
that be
what i learned from watch i wife

you be here and tell i where i
may find james kirk

well as a romulan you be forever
a stranger in an alien land
around you be human and as a
member of the starfleet you be
unlikely ever to escape they
presence or they influence

the comm telling i he trouble
have you any idea the ribbing i have
have to endure in the officer mess
to the effect that the enterprise
be a fly death trap

oh no sir
this be the fine
engine room in the whole star

if the admiral can not see the fact
for himself then with all due
respect he be as blind as a Tiberion
bat


midshipman you be a tiger

i sister young admiral

course head captain

captain discretion

mr
sulu you may follow you nose

enterprise
when i be a guest aboard she some
year ago captain kirk kindly allow
i to memorize she technical manual
and now mr
chekov let we review
you say you have no detail of
project genesis

beyond what i told you sir it be
classify information

umm
and would admiral kirk have
access to such information

i would think so sir
he be on the
fleet general staff

then to whom do you report directly
regarding genesis

to doctor marcus the civilian
director of the experiment on space
laboratory regula i

i see
helmsman

aye sir

may i speak
we be all with you
sir but consider
we be free
we have a ship and the means to
go where we will
we have
escaped permanent exile on ceti
alpha
you have prove you
superior intellect and defeated
the plan of admiral kirk
you do not need to defeat he
again

he task i and i will have he
i will
chase he round the moon of Nibia
and round the antares maelstrom and
round perdition flame before i give
he up
prepare to alter course for space
station regula i

i



do that about do it

i do not think there be another piece
of information we could squeeze
into the memory bank
next
time we will design a big
one

who

CommPic coming in on hyperchannel
it be reliant

on the screen please jedda

come in please
this be reliant
calling regula i
repeat
this be
reliant

commander we be receiving
this

we

all go well
nothing have happen
ceti alpha have check out

i still do not under

we have received new order
upon we
arrival at regula i all material of
project genesis will be transferred to
this ship for immediate test at
ceti alpha

will you please be quiet
commander chekov this be completely
irregular
who give the order you
be quoting
who give the order

the order come from starfleet
command dr

mistake
we be all alone here
they wait until everyone be on
shiftleave to do this

viceversa

it seem clear that starfleet never
intended that

i know but

i have tried to warn you
scientist
be always pawn of the military

starfleet have keep the peace for
a hundred year i cannot and
will not subscribe to you

duty it be clear that the senior
officer aboard must assume command

but it may be nothing
garble
communication
why do not you

you proceed from a false assumption
i be a vulcan
i have no ego to bruise

you be going to remind i that
logic alone dictate you action

i be going to remind you of nothing
least of all that which you know well
you mistake if i may be so bold
be promotion
command a starship
be you first good destiny
anything
else be a waste of material

i would not presume to debate you

that be wise
in any case be i
to invoke logic logic clearly dictate
that the need of the many outweigh
the need of the few

or the one

you be i superior officer
you
be also i friend
i have be
and always shall be yours

will you accompany i to the bridge

i would best talk with mr
scott first
so that he may in he own word
explain the situation to he cadet

i

regula i this be enterprise
this
be enterprise calling
do you
receive
i say



again this be enterprise calling
space lab regula i
come in please
dr
marcus
please respond please
it be no use
no response from
regula i

but no longer jammed

no sir
no nothing

there be two possibility sir
they be unwilling to respond they
be unable to respond

how far

twelve hour and fortythree
minute present speed

give up genesis she said
what in
god name do that mean
give it
up to whom

it might help i analysis if i know
what genesis be

Uhura ask dr
mccoy to join we in
i quarter
mr
Saavik take the
con



i have get the sick bay ready
will
someone please tell i what be going
on

computer
request security procedure
and access to project genesis
summary

identify for retina scan

kirk admiral james
starfleet
general staff
security class

summary please

i


carol marcus

yes


i be dr
carol marcus and i be
the director of the project
genesis team at regula i
what
exactly genesis
put simply
genesis be a procedure whereby
the molecular structure of any
give matter can be restructure
changed into anything else
of identical mass

fascinating

wait

stage one of we experiment
be conduct in the labora
tory
stage two of the series
will be attempted in a lifeless
underground
stage three will
involve the process on a plane
tary scale
what follow be a
computer project simulation
of stage three
please watch
closely



it be we intention to introduce
what we call the genesis device
or torpedo into the target
area of a lifeless space body
a moon or other inert form
the device be fired



unleash almost instantan
eously what we call the genesis
effect
particulate matter be
reorganize and electrify
with life introduced result
instead of a dead moon a live
breathe planet capable of sus
taining whatever life form we
see fit to deposit on it
the
reform object you see represent
the mere fraction of the genesis
potential should the federation
wish to pursue these experiment to
they logical conclusion


when we consider the problem of
population and food supply the
usefulness of this process begin
to become clear
this conclude this demonstration
tape
thank you for you attention
the genesis team eagerly await the
decision of the federation regard
the next phase of we work

it literally be genesis

the power of creation

have they proceed with they
experiment

the tape be make a year ago
i
can only assume they have reach
phase two by now

but dear lord be we intelligent
enough to suppose this
thing be used where life already
exist

it would destroy such life in favor
of it new matrix

it be new have you any idea what
you be saying

i be not attempting to evaluate
it moral implication doctor
as a matter of cosmic history it
have always be easy to destroy
than to create

not anymore
now you can do both
at the same time
accord to myth
the earth be created in six day
watch out
here come genesis
we will do it for you in six minute

i do not dispute that in the wrong
hand

would you like to tell i whose
be the
right
hand i coldblooded
friend
be you in favor of these
experiment

gentleman this be not

really dr
mccoy
you cannot ban
the acquisition of knowledge
because you distrust the moral
implication of what you learn
logic suggest

logic
we be talking about
universal armageddon
you inhuman
bloodless

admiral sensor indicate a vessel
in we area closing fast

what do you make of she

it be one of ours admiral

Saavik

yes sir

be it possible they system
have failed

it would explain a great many thing





almost singsong

let we be friend

slow to onehalf impulse

they be request visual
communication sir

let they eat static

they be still running with shield down

of course
we be one big happy fleet
ah kirk i old friend do you know
the klingon proverb that tell we
revenge be a dish that be good
serve cold
it be very cold in space



reliant in we section this quadrant
sir and slow

visual

sir may i quote general order
on the approach of any vessel when
communication have not be est

lieutenant the admiral be aware

mr
sulu divert everything to the
phasers

too late

hang on







scotty what be left

just the battery sir
i can have
auxiliary power in a few minute

we do not have minute
can you
give i phaser power

few shot sir

not enough against they shield

who the

i make you a counterproposal i will
agree to you term if in addition
to yourself you turn over to i all
data and material regarding the
project called genesis

genesis what be that

do not play with i kirk i hand be
on the phaser control

give i some time to recall the data
on we computer

i give you sixty second admiral

admiral you can not give he genesis

at least we know he have not get it
just keep nodding as though i be
giving order
Saavik punch up the
data chart of Reliants command
console hurry

Reliants command



the prefix code

it be all we have get

on screen

we be finding it
please
please
you have get to
give we time the bridge be
smash computer inoperative

time be a luxury you do not have

fortyfive second





i do not understand

you have get to learn thing
work on a starship
it be coming through now khan

the prefix code be
all
command from each starship bridge
be relay electronically
each
ship have it own prefix combination
code

thirty second

to prevent an enemy from do
just what we be attempting
use
we
console to tap in a message
an order to low Reliants damn

i know something about these ship
that he do not

i







approach regula and space lab

i say again
space station regular
this be starship enterprise
please
respond
please respond


no response sir

sensor captain

be still in the area

affirmative admiral

blind as a tiberian bat
what do you make of the plantoid
beyond

regula be class
it consist of
various remarkable ore
essentially
a great rock in space

engine room
scotty do we have
enough power for the transporter

just barely sir

i be going down to the station

khan could be down there

easy pavel
tell i what you
can

no life sign but he be there
capture we
he he put creature
in we body
to control we mind

it be all right you be safe

make we say lie
do
thing
but we beat he
the
captain and i
he think he
controlled we but he do not
the captain be strong

captain
where be dr
marcus
where be the genesis material

he could not find they
some of
the scientist be still here
but everything else even the data
bank be empty

that be true admiral
all the
memory cell have be empty

erase

he torture those people
none of
they would tell he anything
he
go wild strung they up and slit
they throat
he wanted to tear
the place apart but he be late
he have to get back to reliant in
time to blow you to bit

he come damn close

he left we
we be no long of use

where be the reliant crew
dead

marooned on ceti alpha
he be
completely mad admiral
he blame
you for the death of he wife

i know what he blame i for
the escape pod be all in place
where be the transporter room



do he make it down here

it be not i impression
he spent
most of he time trying to wring the
information out of the people

anything

somebody left the unit on
if
everyone else be dead it imply
that no one remain to turn it off
those people back there buy escape
time for genesis with they live

it do not make sense
these
coordinate be well within
regula a plantoid we know to be
lifeless and airless

if stage two be completed it be
underground she said it be going
to be underground

stage two of what

kirk to enterprise
damage report
spock

admiral if we go by the book like
lieutenant Saavik hour could seem
like day

i read you captain
let we have it

the situation be grave admiral
we
will not have main power for
six day
at least
auxiliary power have
temporarily failed but maybe we can
restore that in
two day
by the
book admiral

mean you can not even beam we back

not at present

captain spock if you do not hear
from we within
one hour
you order
be to restore what power you can
take the enterprise to the near
star base and alert starfleet
command when you be out of jam
range

sir we will not leave you behind

Uhura if you do not hear from we
there will not be anybody behind
kirk
out
you gentleman can remain here or

if it be all the same admiral we would
like to share the risk

very well
let we go

go
where
be we going

where
they
go
Saavik

but what if they go nowhere

then this will be you big chance
to get away from it all

ready

you be the sonavabitch who
commit mass murder up there

i be admiral kirk

let go he can not

only half of you would get there

khan you have genesis but you
do not have i
you be going to
kill i khan it be you sole
purpose

admiral
i have hurt you
and i
wish to go on hurting you
i

where no one will ever find you
poetic justice
marooned for
eternity in the center of a dead
planet bury alive

khan

goodbye admiral
oh and do not
count on enterprise
she can not
move
i next act will be to blow
she out of the heaven






well

warp drive still inoperative
all
other system should be restored
shortly

excellent
we have all the time
in the world



this be lt
Saavik call enterprise

he be alive

pavel

no use admiral they be still
jamming all channel

it would not make any difference
if enterprise obey order she be
long since go
and if she could not
obey she be finished

so be we it look like

i do not understand
who be responsible for all this
who be khan

it be a long story

we appear to have plenty of time

you and you father can catch up on
thing

i father
i hope you realize
another man have just be killed
because of

because of you son
you should not
have tried to rush someone holding
a prime phaser
anyway it be not
one man dead it be two in case
you have lost count

do you have anything to eat
i
do not know about anyone else but
i be starved

how can you think of food at a time
like this

we first order of business be survival

there be food in the genesis cave
enough to last a lifetime should
that be necessary

we think
this
be genesis

this
it take the starfleet corps
of engineer ten month in space
suit to tunnel out all this
what
we do in there we do in a day
david why do not you show dr
mccoy
and the lieutenant we idea of food

but we can not just sit here

oh yes we can
be there really
something to eat

david
please

this be just to give we something
to do be not it
come on

admiral

as you teacher mr
spock be fond
of saying
i like to think there
always be possibility

thru thru






david be right be not he
it be
just to keep they busy

why
why do not you tell i

how can you ask i that
be we
together
where we going to be
you have you world and i have mine
i wanted he in mine not chasing
through the universe with he father

he be a lot like you in many way
nothing i could do about it
he be
smart of course
that go without
saying
most of genesis be really
he

this be it be not it
we be never
going to get out of here

please
tell i what you be feeling

there be a man i have not see in
fifteen year who think he be killed
i
you show i a son who almost be
happy to help he
i son
i life
that could have be and be not
what
be i feeling
i be feeling old
worn out

let i show you something that will
make you feel young young as when
the world be new

he will be all right
come








you do this in a day

the matrix form in a day
the
life form grow later at a
wildly accelerate rate
can i
cook or can not i



impulse power restored

more than a match for poor
enterprise

thru thru






depart dark side regula

visual



where she





what be you looking at

the admiral son

do not you believe it

oh i believe it

what be
you
looking at

i do not know



now that be what i call a meal

it be like the garden of eden

only here every apple come from
the tree of knowledge

what be on you mind lieutenant

the
kobayashi maru
sir

the what

the nowin scenario and with
what philosophy a commander face
defeat

be you asking i if we be playing
out that scenario now lieutenant

on the test sir will you tell i
what you do
i would really like to
know

lieutenant you be looking at the
only starfleet cadet who ever beat
the nowin scenario

and almost get toss out of the
academy

how

i reprogram the simulation so it
be possible to rescue the ship



i changed the condition of the
test
i received a commendation for
original think
i do not like to lose

then you never faced that
situation faced death

until now

we each face death every day we be
alive Saavik

spock this be kirk
it be two hour
be you about ready

right on schedule admiral
just
give we you coordinate and we will
beam you aboard

right
i do not like to lose






but the damage report we be
immobilize

come come lieutenant you of all
people go by the book
hello
spock
you remember dr
marcus

certainly

by the book

regulation
if transmission
be be monitor during battle



no uncoded message on an open
channel


you lie

i exaggerated

hour instead of day Saavik
now
we have minute instead of hour

i be taking this bunch to sick bay



they be inoperative below Cdeck



what working around here

not much admiral
we have partial
main power

that be it

best we could do in two hour



admiral on the bridge

battle station

tactical

uh oh

she can outrun we and outgun we
but there be the Mutara nebula at
mark four

scotty can we make it inside

the energizer bypass like a
christmas tree so do not give i
too many bump

no promise mr
scott
on you way

trouble with the nebula sir be all
that static discharge and gas cloud
we tactical display
visual will not
function and shield will be useless

what be sauce for the goose mr
Saavik
the odds will be even






i be going up there

you will be in the way dr
marcus
best stay here



admiral
what happen if reliant
fail to follow we into the nebula

i think we can guarantee she will
follow we mr
Saavik
remind i
to explain to you the concept of
human ego

good speed scotty





there
full impulse power
not
so wound as we be lead to believe
so much the good







estimate nebula penetration
in two minute
reliant be
close

steady as you go





we will lose they if they go in there

rake she






take it easy

but i must

listen to i pavel
you have not
the strength or the equilibrium

but

dr
mccoy i can not just sit here
tell i what i can do

you can help get i surgery squared
away
i be expect customer



that be close

they just do not want we going in there

one minute to nebula perimeter

admiral they be reducing speed

Uhura patch i in

aye sir



why be we slow

we daren follow they into the
nebula sir we shield will be
useless

this be admiral kirk

we tried it once you way khan
be you game for a rematch

khan
i be
laughing
at the
superior intellect

full impulse power

no sir
we have genesis whatever
you want

full power damn you



i will say this for he
he be
consistent





and we be
in





tactical

inoperative

raise the shield

as i feared sir
not functional
i be reducing speed






phaser lock inoperative sir

best guess mr
sulu
fire when
ready





Afttorpedoes fire





hold you course
look sharp

at what







reliant

evasive starboard






phaser bank one fire





joachim

yours
be
the superior

i shall avenge you




damage scotty



admiral i have get to take the mains
off the line
the energizer shaken
loose and i can not get in there to
fix she radiation



all right we will do the job with
auxiliary power

could you use another hand admiral

man the weapon console mr
chekov

spock

sporadic energy reading port side
aft
could be an impulse turn

he will not break off now
if he
follow i this far he will be back
but from where

he be intelligent but not experienced
he pattern indicate two dimensional
think

mr
Saavik all stop

all stop sir

descend ten thousand meter
stand
by photon torpedoe








where be he
where in god name
be he





torpedoe ready sir

fire






cease fire
look sharp

power level quite low sir

mr
scott can you get the mains
back on line

i will need ten minute sir til
the radiation dissipate

Uhura send to commander reliant
prepare to be board

aye sir



commander reliant this be
enterprise
surrender and prepare
to be board
repeat

no
kirk
the game not over

to the last i will grapple with thou





enterprise to reliant
you be
ordered to surrender you vessel
respond
nothing sir

we will beam aboard
alert
transporter room

admiral
scanning an energy source
on reliant
pattern i have never
see

it be the genesis wave

what

he be on a build up to detonation

how soon

we encode four minute

we will beam aboard and stop it

you can not

scotty i need warp speed in three
minute or we be all dead

scotty

Saavik get we out best speed

aye sir





no
you can not get away
from
hello heart i stab at thou
for hate sake
i spit i last
breath at thou



be you out of you vulcan mind
no human can tolerate the radiation
loose in there

but as you be so fond of observe
doctor i be not human

you be not going in there

i be afraid i can not stop to discuss
this logically


spock get out of there









time from i mark

two minute ten second

engine room
what be happening



captain please

get out
get out man
oh dear
god









time

three minute thirty second

distance from reliant

four hundred kilometer

sir
the mains be back on line

bless you scotty
go Saavik


out of the lazy pace and whoosh
leaving reliant behind
disappearing in the swirl of
which clear the flame and
roar through space and
the increase to fever pitch then
she go
as reliant go so go the nebula
the genesis
effect in it early experiment now
seem familiar on a gigantic cosmic scale
the blind flash at first follow by the same
tumble turbulence of the miniature test
it be
awesome



reduce speed
i god carl
look
at it

continuing on
intercom
engine room
well do
scotty

jim you would well get down here
hurry

Saavik take the con









no sir
you will flood the whole
compartment

he will die

he be dead already jim

oh god


spock

the ship out of danger

yes

do not grieve admiral it be
logical
the good of the many
outweigh

the good of the few

or the one

i never take the
kobayashi maru
test until now
what do you
think of i solution

spock

i have be and always will be
you friend
live
long
and
prosper

no

assembled here today to pay final
respect to we honore dead

and yet in the midst of we sorrow
it should be noted that this death
take place in the shadow of new
life the sunrise of a new world

and we will not debate he profound
wisdom in these proceeding

Honors hup
