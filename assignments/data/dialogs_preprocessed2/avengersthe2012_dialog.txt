if she
reach peak level

we have prepared for this doctor
harness energy from space

we do not have the harness
we
calculation be far from complete
now

you people
they will win he the
earth
in return i suspect for the
tesseract

an army
from outer space












walk in with coulson
to


no hard feeling point break
you have
get a mean swing
also it mean the portal can open as
wide and stay open as long as loki
want
uh raise the midmast ship the top
sail
that man be playing
think we would not notice
but we do
covering he eye look

how do fury do this

he turn

well that sound exhaust
the rest
of the raw material agent barton can
get he hand on pretty easily
only
major component he still need be a
power source
high energy density
something to kick start the cube

when do you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysic

last night
the packet Selvigs note
the extraction theory paper
be i the
only one who do the read

do loki need any particular kind of
power source

he be get to heat the cube to a
hundredand twenty million kelvin just
to break through the coulomb barrier

unless Selvig have figure out how to
stabilize the quantum tunneling effect

well if he could do that he could
achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor
on the planet

finally someone who speak english

be that what just happen

it be good to meet you dr
banner
you be work on antielectron collision
be unparalleled
and i be a huge fan of
the way you lose control and turn into
an enormous green rage monster

thanks

dr
banner be only here to track the
cube
i be hope you might join he

let we start with that stick of he
it
may be magical but it work an awful
lot like a weapon

i do not know about that but it be
powered by the cube
and i would like to
know how loki used it to turn two of
the sharpe man i know into his
personal fly monkey

monkey
i do not understand

i do
i understood that reference

shall we play doctor

let we play some

the gamma reading be definitely
consistent with Selvigs report on the
tesseract
but it be going to take week to
process

if we bypass they mainframe and direct
a reroute to the homer cluster we can
clock this around six hundred
teraflops

all i packed be a tooth brush

you know you should come by
sometime
top ten floor all

you would love it it be candy land

even if barton do not post that all
over the news

the stark tower
that big ugly
building in new york









i think Lokis trying to wind we up
this be a man who mean to start a war
and if do not stay focus he will
succeed
we have order we should
follow they

following be not really i style

and you be all about style be not you

of the people in this room which one
be

wearing a spangly outfit and
not of use

steve tell i none of this smell a
little funky to you

just find the cube

that be the guy i dad never shut up
about
wonder if they should not have
keep he on ice

shrapnel trying every second to crawl
it way into i heart
point at the
in he chest
this stop it
this little circle of
light
it be part of i now not just
armor
it be a
terrible privilege

but you can control it

because i learned how

it be different

hey i have read all about you accident
that much gamma exposure should have
killed you

so you be saying that the hulk
the
other guy
saved i life

that be nice
it be a nice sentiment
save it for what

i guess we will find out

you might not like that

you just might

as soon as loki take the doctor we
moved jane foster

he once he be do
erik be a good man

he talk about you a lot
you changed
he life
you changed everything around
here

they be good as they be
we
pretend on asgard that we be more
advance but we
we come here
battling like

like what


you know
huge scaly big
antler
you do not have those

do not think so

they be repulsive and they trample
everything in they path

when i first come to earth Lokis rage
follow i here and you people paid
the price
and now again
in i youth i
courted war



war have not start yet
you think you can make loki tell we
what the tesseract be

i do not know
Lokis mind be far
afield it be not just power he crave
it be vengeance upon i
there be no pain
that would prize he need from he

lot of guy think that until the
pain stop

what be you asking i to do

i be asking
what be you prepare to
do

loki be a prisoner

then why do i feel like he be the only
person on this boat that want to be
here

there be not many people that can sneak
up on i
turn to see

after
after whatever torture fury can
concoct you would appear as a friend
as a balm
and i would cooperate

red
daughter



barton told i
everything
you ledger be dripping
it be gush red and you think saving
a man no more virtuous than yourself
will change anything


this be the base sentimentality
this
be a child at prayer





you lie and kill in the service of
liar and killer



you pretend to be separate to have
you own code something that make up
for the horror
but they be a part of
you and they will never go away

i will not touch barton
not until i make
he kill you
slowly
intimately
in
every way he know you fear
and when
he will wake just long enough to see his
good work and when he scream i will
split he skull

one more turbine go down and
we drop

stark i be here

good
see what we get

i get to get this super conduct
cool system back online before i can
access the rotor and work on
dislodge the debris

i need you to get to that engine

be in overload position

what be it look like in there

it seem to run on some form of
electricity

well you be not wrong

we be not you enemy banner
try to
think



the relay be intact
what be we next
move

even if i clear the rotor this thing
will not reengage without a jump
i be
going to have to get in there and push

well if that thing get up to speed
you will get shred

then stay in the control unit and
reverse polarity long enough to
disengage mag

speak english

see that red lever
it will slow the
rotor down long enough for i to get
out
stand by it wait for i word

we need a full evac on the low hangar
bay





we get perimeter breach
hostile be
in gear
hold on to every
junction

level and

sir the hulk will tear this place
apart

get he attention

escort proceed to

do not get too close

target acquired
target engaged
pull the trigger
fire
gun at




they be not get through here so
what the hell



sir we have lost all power in engine

it be barton

do anybody copy

this be agent romanoff
i copy



stark we be losing altitude
