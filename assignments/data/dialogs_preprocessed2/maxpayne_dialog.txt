retirement or facing the charge he be
going to bring against i

down in that bar and explain that i
could either give up the thing i loved
or i could have it taken away by force
that be i choice
beat
i


you could have put a gun in you mouth
any time you wanted
or you could have
keep living in the hell i make for you
that be you choice
