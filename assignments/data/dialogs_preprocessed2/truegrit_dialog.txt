nothing prevent you from offering a reward
or from so informing a marshal
it would have to be real
money though to be persuasive

daisypicking expedition
upwards of threescore
marshal have be slaughter in the territory
mattie
i will see to the money
who be the good marshal
sheriff
i would have to weigh that proposition
i reckon william

something to see he cut for sign
the mean one be
rooster Cogburn
he be a pitiless man double tough and
fear do not enter into he think
he love to pull a cork
the good be probably

quinn he bring he prisoner in
alive
he may let one get by now and again but he believe
even the bad of man be entitle to a fair shake
quinn be a
good peace officer and a lie preacher to boot
he will not
plant evidence or abuse a prisoner
he be as straight as
string
yes i will say quinn be about the good they have

mattie

shoe

LeBoeuf
Azh i understand it Chaneyor Chelmzhford azh he called
himshelf in Texasshot the shenatorzh dog
when the
shenator remonshtrated Chelmzhford shoot he azh well
you could argue that the shoot of the dog wazh merely an
inshtansh of malum prohibitum but the shoot of a
shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in shay
rooster
Mallamen what
mattie
malum in se

in itself and an act that be wrong only accord to we law
and more

the closhesht i have be
with the Sharpsh carbine that
izh within range
but i wuzh mounted and have the choish of
firing offhand or dishmounting to shoot from reshtwhich
would allow Chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh
i fired
mountedand fired wide
rooster
