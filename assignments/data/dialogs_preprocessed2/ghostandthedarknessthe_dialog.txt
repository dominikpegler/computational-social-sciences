the female be big only animal
here like that have to be or they
would not survive because the male
eat the young

i know we be right to be here to
bring christianity into they live
enrich they soul

beaumont say it be to end slavery

we all have we reason
mine be
simply to make they understand
happiness accept salvation know the
serenity that come
best i stop
one of the byproduct
of i belief be that i can become
amazingly bore
but i know god smile

starling amazingly good
natured laugh
and now

welcome to tsavo

because tsavo be the bad place in
the world
come john to the bridge

as they pass the
tent area where prayer be
start
it be all wonderfully under control
samuel you have do a splendid job

thank you
the truth be this
you
have to work at it constantly

the worker do not get on

get on
they detest each other
obviously the african hate the
indian
but the indian also hate
the other indian
some of they
worship cow while other eat they

railhead be across there

three thousand man laying track when
the bridge be do it all join up

do it look like this in you mind

this be more difficult

but how wonderful that it be
difficult it should be difficult
what good job in all the world
than build a bridge
make thing
connect bring world together and
get it right

finish you tour

and anxious to get start
what be this mostly malaria

yes but they suffer be only
transitory once they except god
into they heart he will vanquish
all pain

that be just vomitous talk nigel the
poor bastard will relapse if you keep
on that way

i be david hawthorne this be i
hospital
and i advice to you be
do not get sick in front of it

that be mean to be charming
sorry
i seem to have lost the knack

you never have it

nigel and i do not like each other much

i be also liaison between these two

clearly you do not agree about build
the railroad

this sham
ridiculous
who need it
it be only be build to control the
ivory trade make man rich

then why do you stay

who else would hire i
beat you to it do not i
oh yes almost forget bring you a
little welcome gift

this be karim one of i orderly
attack by a maneater early
today first incident of that kind
here

maneater attack and you be such
a buffoon you almost forget to mention
it

well he get away do not he
ride a donkey not far from here
when the lion spring on they donkey
take the brunt of it then suddenly
the lion run off

i know it be you first day and of
course you must be tire from the
journey
but what be you going to do about
it

karim will have to show i where it
happen
and of course i will need
the donkey
with any luck i will sort it out tonight
and he walk out leaving
an astonish starling
stare after he

i could not believe it when you said
sort it out
as if it be the most
normal thing in the world
Hohum
what lovely tea i think i will bag a
killer beast this evening nothing
much else going on anyway


well he put i in a spot do not he
but that be all right after all i be
responsible for everything that happen
here
and it certainly will not do much
for morale if a maneaters on the prowl

you said of course you would need the
donkey
why of course

taking a rifle
moving outside
we know three thing about maneaters
first they always return to where
they have attack before
second they be
always old they can not catch other
animal so they turn to we
and third
they be always alone they have be cast
out by they pride because they can not
keep up

i do not suppose i could watch

might be exciting for you

i have never be all that adventurous
i would not be in the way

i would love the company
and i have hunt
all i life

well why not
you seem so calm and
experience
why not indeed

i hate to be a bother john but the
cramp get bad
pull up he trousers
he leg be knotted
the pain be actually quite unbearable
now

shhh

i be sure you mean that to be comfort
but

you will have to deal with it nigel

that be precisely i plan but back in
i tent

they own the night nobody move when
there be a maneater out there

john
i know this be not the time to ask
but

what

since you would only be here three hour
when we meet be you sure this be how
you hunt lion

not to terrify you nigel but it be bad
than you think i have never even see one

one shoot

so that be what a lion look like

one shoot one

patterson have make the night safe
again


now as the crowd
continue to grow

all right i would like to start the
embankment today
sufficient supply on hand

more than

with much more on the way
john we could have have this chat on
flatter ground

true enough but without the comedy
relief
starling amazingly good
natured smile get
back up

how lucky we be

be not we full of ourselves today
i think it be because of the lion

possibly

you know i too have killed a lion

how many shot do you need

i used i hand

all right thou second embankment
will go there
he gesture toward
the river

you do plan to mark it a bit more
precisely than just
there


in you honor nigel
and you and
singh will be in charge of build
they and you will also build the
roadbeds and the three foundation
pillar and you will be finished in
eight thril week

john it will not be easy

nigel you will just have to use you
hand
and he smile repeating
singhs gesture both
palm out

what be they looking at

you they cannot believe you be
still here

nonsense

you do not know what tsavo means do
you
it mean slaughter

what the lion must have do once
he would killed singh be lick he skin
off so he could drink he blood

then he feast on he starting
with he foot

please you need not be so graphic

you intend sort this out tonight

i will try but this feel so different
that old lion i killed could never
carry off a man singhs size

but you said they be always old

that be what the book say

you be contracted to work

malaria epidemic
very sudden

let i see the sick

oh you be a doctor now too

there be no reason for fear

on that i choose to remain dubious
two be dead now in two night

second death
where


far end of camp man wandering alone
at night
Hawthornes examining the
body now
there be even less of he than of singh

but it be crazy the lion should not be
that hungry this soon
get control he
look to samuel
samuel

we should construct thorn fence
around every tent area
fire burn
at night

fine
get start
and a strict curfew
no one allowed out at night
send half you man to the bridge the
rest with these two
and i be sorry for i tone early
but
i repeat there be no reason for fear
i will kill the lion and i will build
the bridge

of course you will you be white you
can do anything
they look at each
other
they be not
friend
now

not good enough look it be get to
be tight
tighter

what a good week

you mean nobody die

we all worked together
worthy deed
be accomplished
i liked the labor
i mother insist on piano lesson
broke the dear woman heart when i
turned out to be tone deaf but she
still be always at i about be
careful with i hand
i like the blood be that strange

oh yes i think so
starling smile start
to speak

look out samuel here it come

even you two must admit that it be a
glorious thing what man can
accomplish
when there be a common
splendid goal there be no limit
think what we will accomplish when we
all have god warmth in we heart
samuels eye have
close
he begin to snore
patterson can not help
laughing

i be immune to you disdain
when i come here i have but one small
goal
to convert the entire continent
of africa
now i have decided to move on to
something really difficult
i will not
rest until both of you be safely in
the fold

i have have four wife good luck

the struggle be the glory

for you

thank you samuel

watch as patterson
open it
good news

i expect so it be from i wife

do you love she

i do actually
very much

you give i hope john

darling one the big excitement
yesterday be when some school
child spotted a whale
they be looking at i john

that be an attempt at humor but i
do not feel very funny these day
i
miss you terribly and after we son
i still have total confidence well
after he be born i think travel might
be broadening
as he kick i at
night i be quite sure he be telling i
he definitely want to come to africa
think you might need remind

jesus two of they

shouting over the noise
of the approaching train
oh sing a different song abdullah
gesture toward the man
who stand by the train
track
there be nothing wrong with you man
so stop telling i there be

you do not call i a liar you know
nothing of they health consider
yourself fortunate i persuade so
many to stay consider yourself
fortunate i have decided to stay

you think you matter
gesture toward the
train which be close to
stopping now
beaumont be on that train he
matter

he see this chaos he will replace
you all

he will replace you too that be all
you really care about

you think so
fine
it be best you get out
go
tell all
you people to go run home where
they will be safe under the cover and
when the bridge be build and the
railroad be do they can tell they
woman that out of all the thousands
who worked here they be the only
one to flee
and he wheel around
start to walk away as we

pleasant journey

how could it be
i hate africa

lovely sound they seem happy

do not they though

so work must be going well

truthfully
there have be the occasional odd
hiccup but then as you so wisely
told i i would never build in africa

but overall you be please

i have never experienced anything
like it

i almost feel like get right
back on

i suppose it would be a dereliction
of duty not to at least look around

morning friend glorious day

as be they all

i do need to see starling

starling

awhile back he ordered some bible
i have bring they
be he here

yes he be

well i need to speak to he

let i deliver the bible

excellent show
where be starling

here he come now

what in hell be going on

the ghost and the darkness have come

in english

it be what the native be calling
the lion
two lion have be cause trouble

what be the surprise in that this be
africa

it have not be that simple so far

what have they do besides kill
starling
how many have they killed
patterson nod for
hawthorne to answer

well of course i can not supply a
totally accurate answer because
there be those that be actually
authenticate and there be those
that we once think be worker
killing each other or desert
from camp so any number i give be
subject to error

how many

thirty i should think

christ
what be you do about it

this be suppose to be salvation
what kind of idiocy be we dealing
with here

i be calling it i contraption
we be going to surround it with a
boma a fence to you and we be
going to leave a small open
opposite that door

in that half will be bait human
bait i will start thing off
point to the open
doorway
a slide door will fit above that
and a trip wire will run across
the floor

genius the beast will enter
trip the wire the door will
slide down trapping he you safe
behind the bar will have he at
you mercy and will shoot he

be you running a high fever man
how could you expect something as
lunatic as this to succeed
how
could you even conceive of it

i do not conceive of it for the
lion i build one in india when
there be trouble with a tiger

and it worked

in point of fact it do not
but i be convince the theory be
sound

what

i make a mistake hiring you
you be simply not up to the job
silence
then

you genuinely enjoy trying to
terrify people do not you
well
fine
except there be not a high rate
engineer and we both know that
and
since time be so important to you
how long do you think it would take
to find someone else qualify and
bring he here

let i explain about time you have
be here three month and already
two month behind
and the german
and the french be gearing up
and
i do not care about you and i do not
care about the thirty dead i care
about i knighthood and if this
railroad finish on schedule i will
get i knighthood and i want it
glance around as
samuel appear go to
the worker
professional hunter may be the answer

all they will bring be more chaos and
we have plenty of that already and if
they come in word will get out and
what happen to you knighthood then

i be going to try and locate redbeard
i assume you have hear of he

every man who be ever fired a rifle have
hear of he by the time you find he
the lion will be dead

very well the job still yours i will
go
but if i have to return you be
finished
and i will then do everything
i can to destroy you reputation
be i
not fair
tell you you would hate i

i do hate he
take the bag from
samuel pull out flare
i want you to distribute one bag of
flare to every tent area
tell the man to light they if
there be trouble
make it two bag

dear
peace and tranquility continue to
abound here the worker report each
day with a smile except for you
absence this whole adventunre be
provide i nothing but pleasure


fire

very good indeed

we have hunt since childhood

all right you will spend you night
inside
he indicate the railroad
car
the coolie nod
you will have plenty of ammunition
you be totally protected you have
really nothing to fear

that be correct
nothing

not once
you do not hit it once


i would never make excuse but a
fire broke out the light be bad he
keep moving

well of course he keep moving but
he could not have be more than ten
foot away from the three of you surely
you must have wounded the thing

i assure you we come close many time

the next time we will do well
patterson make no
reaction
move outside

the next time will be as this time
the devil have come to tsavo

that be ridiculous talk and you can not
seriously believe it

moving in tension rise
as other crowd behind he
now you be telling i i belief
i
do not think so

i be not and you know it and do not
push it just listen we have a
problem in tsavo

at last you be right we do you be
the problem in tsavo

careful abdullah

you do not tell i careful you do
not tell i anything you listen
while i talk
now suddenly a shadow
seem to cross

change in plan you listen while
i talk because you have a question
that need answering
will i pull the trigger

it be redbeard abdullah he will kill
you

no hint samuel

you do not know all that have happen
here the devil have come to tsavo

you be right
the devil have come
look
at i
i be the devil

i be a man of peace

be i to take it you want to live

most certainly
absolutely
yes

excellent decision
now he suddenly reach
out shake Abdullahs hand
you name be abdullah
i be sure we will
meet again
go and enjoy the splendid
morning

i think it be be a pleasure

you get old
now he release samuel
turn to patterson
i be sure you be john patterson
stay out of i way
and without another word
he be go

i do not have a chance to thank you

what do i do

get i out of trouble

nonsense samuel would have do
something

we need to talk

let i save time you be the
engineer
you be in charge
you be sorry i be here
right
so far
good because i be not an
engineer i do not want to be
in charge and i be sorry than
you be that i be here i hate tsavo
so i will help you by killing the
lion and leaving and you will help
i by do what i tell you so i
can leave
see any problem

actually no

all right let we go into battle
suddenly taking
Pattersons hand
i be redbeard

somehow i guess

starting now we attack they

how
we do not know where they be

we will have to make they come to we
will not we
and since there be two of
they we be going to set two plan
in motion
first
we must move the entire
hospital by tomorrow night

that be a terrible idea

be it i be sorry but then of
course you be the doctor you
should know

silly thing i ever hear of why
in the world should we go through
all that

i suppose i could answer you
i
suppose i could explain that the
place be so invite what with the
smell of blood and flesh that they
have to strike
it be even possible
that i tell you i find some fresh
paw mark around back which mean
they be already contemplate
feasting here
turning on hawthorne
now he voice build
but i do not want to answer you
because when you question i you be
really saying that i do not have the
least idea what i be do that i be
nothing but an incompetent that i be
a fool
anyone who find i a fool please
say so now

i have be desperate for patterson
to let i move the hospital since the
day he arrive

then we agree

soon

i have to ask why do you need i

i do not really
but understand
something even though it may take
i two or three day to sort this
out
patterson have to smile
at the phrase
when i be go you will still have
to build the bridge
and i do not
want the man to have lost respect
for you

that be very considerate

i be always considerate i mother
taught i that

why do you laugh
you do not
believe she taught i

i do not believe you have a mother
and as redbeard
laugh too

you like he do not you

oh yes
but it take time

you have known he long

since he beard be red

how many cattle

four should do it

they will want a lot of money

have you get it

no but you do
see you be needed after all
and fifty warrior at the camp
before dawn

samuel explain
the
masai chief reply
translate
why so many

because i have two plan to kill
the lion one involve the cattle
the other the man

the ghost and the darkness have
come
and we can do nothing
but if you anger they
they will
stay in tsavo
and life will
become more unberable that i know

two lion be all that have come
they be only lion that i know
and i will kill they both tomorrow

i will need you by i in the morning

whatever you wish

you be certain about tomorrow
but you do not seem excite

you do not enjoy killing do you

then why do it

i have a gift

why do he need you by he

he do not

but
we have hunt many time
he know i be afraid of lion

i spotted one of they
gesture toward
the thicket
in there

the good way to ensure the kill
when you be use tracker be for
one to shoot while the other use
the tracker to force the lion
toward the shooter
have you ever
lead tracker

i can try

samuel say you killed a lion

it be probably luck i would rather
you do the shoot

you would never force the lion to i
and nobody ever get a lion with
one shoot by luck
point hand out
straight
around there be a clear you will
know it from the anthill get
there and hide and listen to the
sound i will make the lion come
directly to you
he gesture for
patterson to take
off and as he do

all of you spread the width of
the clear no gap go

shoot for chrissake


do you ever see a lion that size

not even close
now he move to
patterson
what happen

misfire
it jam

have it ever do that before

do not know

it be Hawthornes

you exchanged weapon
you go into battle with an
untried gun

they have an expression in
prizefighting
everyone have a plan
until they be hit

you have just be hit
the get up be up to you
and he turn move
off and

gentleman there be no sickness smell
at all here and little blood
when
we leave close the gate securely
do not open it til morning and keep
you fire high
any question ask
they now
they understand now
to samuel and hawthorne
you two will sleep beautifully in
you tent
and stay there

and where will you sleep beautifully

patterson and i will be in the old
hospital where the entice smell
of sickness still linger
and by the time we be do i
promise you the odor of blood will
be irresistible

think about something else

have you ever failed

only in life
he walk away
patterson watch


goddammit

it be all right
stay ready
they know it be there

mean to ask you the railroad car
trap
you idea
excellent notion i used the same
device myself once

but of course yours worked

in point of fact it do not but i be
convinced the idea be sound

it would have be a beautiful
bridge john
i never notice
before occupied with other
business Isuppose
never really pay much attention
to that kind of thing but i have have
the time today nothing else on
and this
it be graceful and the
placement could not be pretty
and
he go silent now
stare off

you just get hit
the get up be up to you but
they be only lion
and i be going after they crack
of dawn

in i town when i be little
there be a brute a bully who
terrorize the place
but he be not the problem
he
have a brother who be bad than
he
but the brother be not the
problem
one or the other of they be
usually in jail
the problem come
when they be both free togther
the two become different from
either alone
alone they be only brute
together they become lethal
together they killed

what happen to they

i get big

dear god

they den
have you ever see anything like
this

Nobodys see anything like this
lion do not have cave like this
they be do it for pleasure

one of i chief attribute be that
i be always calm

where could it have go
how
could it get across the water
they be only lion yes

shake he head
he
do not know
do not they have to be

both of they over there

ever have to use a machan
i do once
in india
we will
tonight

they be used to people in tree
not in a clear
it may be tight

not for i i be too bulky and it be
you idea you go up there
take the other to the water tower
for the night

i will be bait alone

yes
and i will be in some distant
tree where i can provide no
assistance whatsoever
can you control you fear

i will have to

i can not control mine i would be lost
without the shame factor driving i

be that suppose to make i feel
well
redbeard do not
reply
now

it be certainly the good chance
they have have to kill you

you think they will come then
why

good luck

why

because i think they be after you

how many do you think they have
killed

the most of any lion
a
hundred
probably more
now redbeard look
up at the young man
johnny

do not fuck up
and he turn never
look back just go

i think another for posterity
this be an important moment in
i life

understand i have help

not a time for modesty bob

undeniably you triumph

oh surely there be enough credit
for we all let we not forget you
do the actual shoot
of course
i hired you i be the general who
put the team together
and general
be the one who tend to be
remember

perhaps you might put you head in
it mouth sir could be a corker

clever idea i like it

i never think i would say this but
i be glad you come

understand you realize now you
could never have do it without
i

actually i could have do it
much more easily without you but
for whatever reason i be glad you
come

where do you go next

some russian prince want to hunt
the himalayas
you

help finish the railroad

i want to meet i son he must be
what two month old

three year i have work for the
railroad
now i do not know why
it
seem a good idea once

i feel the same about the bridge
this country certainly do not ask
for it do not need it

too soon to tell

i life be shaped because someone
invent gunpowder
we live have
cross because two lion go mad
but what if in the future the three
of we do something grand for
humanity
be that worth all the
live
too soon to tell

some mystery should not have
solution

finish he bottle
rise look at patterson
hold you son high
and he turn go
to he tent

he have child

once
on the two
in the firelight
then

i would like to see john patterson
please

could you tell he that he wife
that he family have come to see he

you be positive lion hate baboon
pebble
let we get it over with

where be it

underneath
somewhere

afraid of lion

it be all right samuel we all
get hit
now he shut up
fast and

samuel
and he gesture for
the rifle and the
instant he do

here we still wonder about they
how do they escape for nine month
and kill man
and stop the
railroad
and be they only lion
if you want to decide for yourself
you must go to america
they be at
the field museum in chicago and
even now after they have be dead
a century if you dare to lock eye
with they
you will be afraid

sleep well
