elle walk past arrogant aaron as he sleep at he study
cubicle head back on the chair
she stop back up and wave she hand over he face
when
he do not stir she take a magic marker out of she knapsack
and lean over to write something on he forehead



elle work out on she elliptical Crosstrainer as she listen
to a lecture tape and watch court on mute



failure to act can constitute the actus reus for
accomplice liability if the defendant have the legal duty to
intervene but fail to do so



arrogant aaron wake up with a start check he watch and
rush off to class
oblivious to he facial graffiti which
we can not yet read


professor Stromwell be in front of the class

so you have file a claim
now what
she look over to see elle sitting there typing on she
laptop

ms
woods

do not you also need to have evidence



mean
everyone now stare at elle

mean you need reasonable belief
that you claim would have like
evidentiary support
Stromwell be somewhat impress but do not show it

and what kind of evidentiary support do
this case require
let we ask mr
harriman who clearly believe that i
might be hungry
she look up at arrogant aaron in the back row
who
unknowingly have eat i written on he forehead
he look
back at she confuse as the student around he snicker


close sign be on the door
we see elle and paulette sitting in the
empty salon laughing and clink can of pabst blue ribbon
as they toast elles small victory
we leaving
they laughing as the



be written on the board
pony
tail less madeup elle take note on she laptop as
warner make an argument

accord to swinney v
neubert swinney
who be also a private sperm donor be
allow visitation right as long as he
come to term with the hour set forth by
the parent
so if we be sticking to
past precedent mr
latimer be not
st al ki ng he be clearly within his
right to ask for visitation

but swinney be a onetime sperm donor
and in we case the defendant be a
habitual sperm donor who also happen to
be harass the parent in he quest for
visitation



but without this mane sperm the
child in question would not exist
he grin and look around as the class murmur they
agreement

now you be think like a lawyer
enter from the back holding a file
he stand there
quietly watch
elle tentatively raise she hand

ms
woods
sarah look at claire

the idiot speak

although mr
huntington make an
excellent point i have to wonder if the
defendant keep a thorough record of each
sperm emission make throughout he life
the class titter
elle grow annoy

why do you ask
elles hesitancy be replace by conviction

well unless the defendant attempted to
contact every single onenight stand to
determine if a child result in those
union then he have no parental claim
whatsoever over this child
why this
s p e rm
why now

Emmetts mouth twitch into a smile



for that matter all masturbatory
emission where he sperm be clearly not
seeking an egg could be term reckless
abandonment
warners mouth hang open
as do sarahs and the rest of
the class
donovan smile

elle shrug and look at donovan

i can go if you want

why you

have you ever be to a spa

and subscribe to the doctrine of self
hatred imposed upon i gender by male
delusion of the way woman be suppose
to look

twice
donovan motion toward elle
then look at emmett with a
pointed get the alibi look



go with she


emmett drive elle be shotgun

explain to i why you be so anti brooke

uh for starter she win give we an
al i bi

aside from that

she be completely untrustworthy

why

she married an old man she be make a
living on telling woman they be too fat
she hawk she crap on the home shopping
network

he be an old man with a really big
penis
she never told i i be fat
and victoria principal sell on that
network

and brooke be obviously hide
something

but maybe it be not what you think

bu t maybe it be
they be quiet for a moment
she look at he

you be kind of be a butthead right
now



how do you figure

because people be not always what they
seem to be and you refuse to see that
have a little faith
you might be
surprise
they be quiet again while he think about this
he look
over at she

i can not believe you called i a butt
head
no one called i a butthead
since ninth grade

maybe not to you face
she give he a teasing smile
he smile back at she
shaking he head


elle and emmett be at the desk

we have two of the clock massage
kerrigan
and woods

go on back

elle start to go then stop

oh and i friend katherine windham
Vandermark be here somewhere and i m
suppose to meet she
for a Pilates class
do you have she schedule

she be in the mud room until four
elle smile she thank and walk off with emmett

damn
we can not see she for an hour



no she can not move for an hour
she grab he arm and pull he down the hall



late s brunette east coast hoity
t o i t y lie on a table like a corpse stiff with mud
cucumber over she eye
elle and emmett poke they head in

mrs
windham Vandermark

we be here from austen platt Jaret
donovan


so you find i
emmett look at elle

she be naked


i m covered in very expensive egyptian
mud hardly naked

i will cover she part
elle settle on three washcloths strategically place


so i hear the tart from california shot
heyworth

well that be what we be trying to prove
do not happen
do you have any reason to
believe it do


i never meet the woman but from what i
daughter tell i she be quite the cun

she be not



do you daughter ever say anything to
you about brooke and Heyworths
relationship


aside from the fact that he find she on
an infomercial
she said they hump like
gorilla
chutney could hear they all
the way in the pool house

i m sure that be very awkward for
chutney
much as it be for i hearing you tell
about it


but i guess it be not enough for brooke

why do you say that


have not you see the cabana boy

ys



e


like i said i have never meet brooke but i
have see she from a distance
when i d
come over to pick up the alimony check
that heyworth forget to mail every month
she would be out by the pool with mr
hot
pants hovering over she with some pink
drink

hover


i do not stick around long enough to
watch he stick he swizzle stick in she
mouth but i d bet i next check that
that s where he be about to put it


emmett drive rave



how can you still believe she be innocent

you be going to trust the word of a woman
who named she child after a condiment
she be lying

and you know this for a fact

do you see the icky black color of she
hair

so

i never trust a woman who be not blonde
except for i friend serena but that be
only because she be a blonde at heart
that be the whole reason i m starting the
blonde legal defense fund
he look at she and laugh

the what

blonde be discriminate against
worldwide
brookes a blonde and people
be saying she be sleeping with the cheesy
pool boy and shooting she husband
if
she be a mousy brunette it would be
oh the poor widow


you be serious
she be fired up now

you should see the way i m treated in
class
i be a complete source of mockery
this be why the blonde legal defense fund
be needed
he go along with it win over by she enthusiasm

okay how would it work



it would be a fullservice law firm by
and for blonde provide positive
blonde role model and community outreach
in high blonde area
i mean think
about it name one blonde intellectual
role model

i can not

that be a direct result of anti blonde
discrimination

wait hilary clinton

if she be a true blonde she would have
left the cheating bastard
blonde do not
let they husband get fellate by
brunette and live to tell about it
emmett frown

in that case maybe heyworth get
fellate by a brunette and brooke
caught he

exactly how much gorilla sex do you think
a sixtyyearold man can take


that be not really a topic that keep i
up at night but maybe it should
elle dig in she purse

speaking of that i buy you some
seaweed cream while we be at the spa
she hand it to he
he keep he hand on the wheel not
taking it

what the hell be that for



the bag under you eye
you be an
attractive man but you need to take
good care of yourself

i do not
do that stuff

he think i m guilty do not he

that be not what be important

to i it be

donovan glare at emmett as they continue in
behind they stop in she track have hear all of
this


donovan take he seat next to brooke

Counselors now

elle woods you honor
rule
of the
supreme judicial court state that a law
student may appear on behalf of a
defendant in criminal proceeding

i have no problem with this

i do
i be not allow it

but you agreed last night
in the
office
when we be discuss i
career

the ruling also state that you need a
license attorney to supervise you
mr
donovan

that i will not agree to

i m supervising you honor

well then ms
woods
proceed



go elle

enjoy prison

mrs
windham you do realize what you be
do

absolutely

do not fuck with a delta gamma

kick some butt

ms
wood call you first witness

i would like to recall chutney windham as a
defense witness



ms
wood begin you questioning
revision


first you honor i d like to point out
that not only be there no proof in this
case but there be a complete lack of men
rea which by definition tell we that
there be no crime without a vicious will

i be aware of the meaning of men rea
what i be unaware of be why you be giving
i a vocabulary lesson instead of
questioning you witness

okay ms
windham when you uh arrive
back at the house
be you father there

not that i see
but like i said i go
straight upstairs to take a shower


and when you come downstairs what happen

i see brooke standing over he body
drenched in he blood

but mrs
windham do not have a gun

no she would stash it by then

move to strike that from the record you
honor
speculation

stricken

do you hear a shot fired
revision


no
i be in the shower

so at some point in the twenty
minute
you be in the shower you
father be shoot

i guess
revision



you father be shoot while you be in
the shower

where be she going with this

have a little faith

but you do not hear the shot because you
be in the shower

yes
i be washing i hair

miss windham can you tell we what you would
be do early in the day

i get up go to Starbucks go to the
gym get a perm and come home

where you get in the shower

yes

i believe the witness have make it clear
that she be in the shower

yes you honor
have you ever get a

perm before miss windham

yes
revision



how many would you say

two a year since i be twelve
you do the
math



you know a girl in i sorority tracy
Marcinko get a perm once
even though we
all told she not to curl really
be not the right look for she
she do not have you bone structure
chutney almost smile

but thankfully that same day she
enter the pi Kap wet tshirt contest
where she be completely hose down from
head to toe
donovan shake he head at she incompetence

objection
why be this relevant
emmett clear he throat worry
elle turn around giving
he a trust i look
then turn back to the judge

i have a point
i promise

then make it
elle look at chutney


chutney why be it that tracy Marcinkos
curl be ruined when she get hose
down

because they get wet

that be right
because be not the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
you be forbid to wet you hair for at
least twentyfour hour after get a
perm at the risk of deactivating the
ammonium thiglycolate
chutney pale



yes

and would not someone who be have thirty
perm
throughout she lifetime be
well aware of this rule

and if you in fact be not washing
you hair as i suspect you be not
since you curl be still intact
would not you have hear the gunshot

and if you in fact hear the gunshot
then brooke windham would not have have
time to hide the gun before you get
downstairs
which would mean that you
would have have to have find mrs
windham
with a gun in she hand to make you story
sound plausible
be not that right

she be young than i be
do she tell
you that
how would you feel if you
father married someone young than you

you however have time to hide the gun
do not you chutney
after you shoot you
father

i do not mean to shoot he
i mean to shoot you



i know it



oh i god

oh i Gd




elle how do you know chutney be lying

because she be brilliant

the rule of haircare be simple and
finite
any cosmo girl would ve known





what the

honey stop
bile on

oh i god
what happen to she tan
