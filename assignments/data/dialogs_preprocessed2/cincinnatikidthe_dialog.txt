if you get the stuff be a little
cocky do not hurt you none

this much of a chance
if lancey be
not right
if he be get a cold or
he stomach ulcer be acting up or
something like that

but then everybody see he be not
right and it would not prove nothing
listen we get to have it understood
if he be not right we call it off
till he be

you be set on a real showdown be not
you
you mind all make up

i get to
you said yourself i get
to
i be overdue

i wish you would shooter man

all right

hey what if he turn i down

he will not the way i will spread the
word
he will have to take you on
someone in you class
if he duck
it that would make you the man

you think he know i be around

he can smell meat like you a mile
and a half up the river
he know
you be around and he will sit down
with you
you want to butt head
with the man i will set it up

there be you woman

i would not want to wait around too
long
i want to get in and get it
over with

he must of come to st
louis for a
big money game
i will probably get
ask do i want to deal it for they
and however long that take he will
have to rest up for you

oh well if he be tooling a dollar
i can understand that
sure

you get much of a stake

close to three grand

work on it
but three grand will
give you a ride and even if you do not
win why you will come away with a
good idea of what you be make of
but once you go in kid you can not
quit
you get that straight right
now
two of you go in and only one
of you can come out

well school out
i damn sure do not
want no lesson
i want everything
he be get

it be the only way to be kid

see you

when we leaving town kid
this week

no i will not be ready
not for a while

i think

might even turn out we do not go

you must feel different about it
than you do saturday

yeah i be feeling a little different

it be all right
you do not have to
act like a cat
you be not bother
i

you want i to turn out the light

no
i be overtired that be why i can not
sleep
sit up and swing
he foot to the floor
why can not you sleep

Undertired i guess
if a person
rest all day she do not have much
to rest up from at night
why do not you have a nice hot bath
i could give you a rubdown and then
you could have a nice hot bath and
then maybe you could sleep

kay
can not hurt to try it

what do you do with yourself this
time

last night i go to a movie with
the shooters woman
french movie

in french

they have the word in english at the
bottom of the picture
but the
shooter woman know what they be
saying without it
pig woman or
somebody told i she go to college

sure
majore in maneating

i think maybe she really do go
but
i never quite dare to up and ask
she

i do not know you run with the
shooter woman

we get to be kind of friendly when
you both be in that threeday game
down to cairo
course she be old
i

and be around more
lot more
what be the movie like

weird
it be not a straight story
where you know whose side you be
on the way you do in regular
picture

american picture

yeah
there be lots of thing i
do not understand

what be it about

well there be this town in europe a
long time ago where they get a message
from a spanish general he be coming
to spend the night with he troop
so all the man be scared silly about
what the soldier will do to they

nothing weird about that

but all the wife and daughter tell
the man to go hide somewhere and let
they bargain with the enemy

that do not make much sense

wait
the way they handle it be they
go to bed with the spaniard
and
the next morning the soldier go off
peacefully and everybody happy

including the husband and father
do not they suspect

that be part of what i be not sure
of
i guess they know what go on
but they care more about they safety
and they money than they do about
they honor

then they get they head screw on
straight
Honors just an idea
you
can not see or feel it and you can not
eat it and you sure as hell can not
get any mileage on it

i will just turn off the bath water

hello
yes it be
you want he
shooter
telephone
shooter

phone for you
i always seem to be
the one to answer it no matter who
it be for

if you would rather we put it in i room

be you kidding

hello
well hello
what bring
you to we fair city
little action
maybe

how could you guess shooter
i be
invited by a mr
william Schlaegel

own most of the Schlaegel brewery
Braumeister beer

as he put it rather bluntly i feel
we do not want everyone to have to
watch everyone else dealing to see
to it they do not make any little
accidental error by mistake
i told
he a man could not ask for a good
guarantee of a fairandsquare game
than have the shooter deal it
so
if you be will we be meeting at
two of the clock in the afternoon
ask
for mr
Schlaegels suite at the
park sherman
good
i be glad you
can do it shooter
be a pleasure to
see you again
oh pretty much the same
just have
to be a little careful about smoke
and drink and eating and
breathe
see you tomorrow
good
night



would you wear it in public

would not be much point wearing it in
private
sure why not as long as
you do not have a bulge to hide

i do not know melba

i guess be there be not anything
about you need hide
but i will
give you a more definitive opinion

tooth sugar

together
let we try to fill each
unforgiving minute with sixty second
worth of distance run


listen what i be going to say
before i do not want you to think
i be be some kind of jerk or i
do not feel you would be great to sack up
with

then let we cut the filibuster

i have make doll that be friend of
mine wife
i figure if they be
will they be do it to they
husband i be not

of course
any other attitude you be
degrading the woman
you be not
treat she as a person with a mind
of she own but as somebody
property

only thing be it be different with
the shooter than anybody else
he be
so straight i get the obligation to
be straight with he than other
people
so do you
on account of we
both owe he plenty

i think we just agreed that what
you and i do be strictly between
we

can not be
decisively pulling
away from she with a
pat of dismissal
shooter the close thing to family
i get
it be almost like he be i
old man
do not you see how that be
get a bear on we

sure it mean i be you mother

shooter very generous of you to
come on such short notice
rosanna
you know and i think you have meet i
daughter june
no point introduce you to william
the fourth
he have a bad memory for
name

greeting they in
turn

why do not you do a batch
of you bloody marys

i have be quite busy on the telephone
since i last see you
there be a lot
of interest all over the country in
this game with lancey and the kid

bet interest

jack doyle in new york be giving
twelve to five on lancey
same odds
in reno
i have taken fifty thousand
of it so far

fifty thousand

i will probably go for more but i do not
want to rock the odds

i know you liked the kid style but
why you going in so deep

two reason
first i want to see
that smug old bastard gut bad
than he gut i
second as long
as that be going to happen i do not
see why i should not make some money
out of it

but how can you be so sure
the kid
could do it we both know that but

could be not good enough for a man
who hate to lose money as much as i
do
he be going to need help from
the good man with a pack of card
between omaha and new orleans

not a chance bill
you ought to
know i never ever use what i get
with the card for nothing but trick
and dress up a game

sure i know it
that be why you be
the man they choose to give they a
square deal
that be what make it so
perfect
Nobodyll be looking for
it

it be out
out

the great thing be they will be so
close the kid will not need much
three
or four key hand

understand this bill
i would like for
the kid to win and i sure as hell
do not want to see you lose all that
money

if i do i would have to collect that
twelve grand you owe i
not myself
i collection agent
you know poor
wildwood jones do not you

but i be paying it off
it be comino
in be not it
six grand already
then as bill just
look at he
bill you get to listen to i

no i do not
it be quite the other
way around
you have some delusion
you be a free agent but you be not
i own you

for god sake

shut up
i will cross the twelve off
the book and give you ten thousand
dollar in cash
and you can tell
the kid if he need more of a stake
i will put it up

maybe i will not have to answer you
question

i never run across anybody like you
i guess i do not understand gambler

that be all right
i do not understand
farmer

you say thing that sound smart
alecky
but i be not sure if they
really be smart alecky

well i can not take into account what
somebody going to feel every time
i say something

be you a believer

in some thing

i mean in god

that be a tough one
i do not disbelieve
in he but i could not say i believe
in he either
i guess i just never
paid he much mind
do not seem
important

god not important

i do not mean what he do be not
important if he exist
i mean
it be not important to i whether he
exist or not

christian be raised in a christian
home

be that so
i do not know
i be not aware of the difference
i be not asking permission to marry
christian you know

i know

if i be the only person i would be
asking it from be she

who be this fella christian say
you be going to play that be so
important

he be the king of the stud poker
player

and you be going to play he

yes

be you any good

i be this good
the man have get to
play i

what happen if he do not

then i be the man

that important to you

i be trying to figure that out
ever since i set it up

you playing because of money

not really

christian said you never be much
worried about money i be worry
about money most of i life up
until i figure out it be not so
important

no it be necessary but it be not so
important

well how come you want to play this
king fella

ambition maybe security like
that

be it aspiration to be the king or
just uncertainty about the future

i be not looking for security if that be
what you mean

not trying to lock something up tight
and nail it down

that would figure into it
but that
be not all of it
it be important
to i

now son which be more important to
you this king business or christian

if you get the guts to ask that
question mr
craigie i guess i get
the guts to answer it
christian if
you come right down to it be not as
important as do what i have to
do

well son i have to know

know what

there never be a man worth a damn
to i mind who let he woman stand
in the way of the thing he have to
do
i get to go now see what i can do
for a sick heifer
why do not you
take christian when she mama let we
go of she and tell she i said you
should go to the old spring
it be a
good place

thanks
i will tell she

it stay warm all winter


papa mama used to bring she wash
up here

we liable to draw an audience

do not worry
it be on we land
nobody use it

you must have say something to papa
give he the picture on we in st
lou
else he never would have speak
to you about this place

i told he on account of he already
know
never any sense feeding a man
a lie he be not going to believe

even if he do know i be glad you
told he

hey you be all wet

so be you foolish

let i get this straight in i head
card be all a matter of luck who
get deal the good one

so when one of you professional
gambler sit down with a bunch of
you what do you call they
customer client

the technical term be sucker
or
mark


they chance of winning be just as
good as yours except if you get a
way to control it who get what
card
right

not right
that be cheating and it be
not any part of what we be talking
about

then how do you win

i will show you

you see one of these card be white
on both side one be red on both
side and the other be white on one
side red on the other

what about it

this
i put the three card in a hat
and shake they up and then i ask
you to draw one card out blind
put
it face down on the table so neither
of we can see the bottom side

okay red on top
that eliminate
the allwhite card right
so the
card you have pick be one of two
the allred or the redandwhite
one out of two be an even chance an
evenmoney proposition
right you
follow i

i think so

so if i said i will bet you a dollar
to seventyfive cent the other side
of that card be red you would take the
bet would not you

seem like
yeah

and that answer make you a sucker
because the odds be two to one the
other side of that card be red and
i ought to be offering you a dollar
to fifty cent instead of seventy
five

but if there be just the two
possibility

there be three possibility
indicate card on
table
that can be the red side of the red
andwhite card or it can be either
side of the allred card
in two
case out of three the other side be
red
and i would win the bet from you
two out of every three time we make
it

you would

sure
it be obvious when i explain
it be not it

reckon so
except if there be only
two thing that the bottom side can
be red or white

take i word for it the odds be
two to one
and knowing that be the
difference between you gamble man
and you sucker
not who get the
well card but who know what the
proper odds be
in a poker game
there can be a million different
situation each with a different
set of odds to figure
the man who
end up winner be the man who know
when to bet and how much

the sucker be still take advantage
of be not he
the gambler know
something he do not know

sure like if you grow good corn
or raise a cow that give more milk
than the other guy
or two business
man be in competition or two lawyer
be up against each other in a
courtroom
whatever you line be
the one who win out be the one who
know he job well

seem like there should be something
else to it

there be making the man you be
playing against think he be get the
good hand and making he pay to
find out

i can not stay long
Papall be get
up to milk

i be the one can not stay
i get to
head for that bus

why do you come kid

well hell i do not know
i have kind
of a rough time after you left

rough how

tuesday there be a ball game but
then the cardinal go on the road
i never known time to drag so
i be
all torn apart

because of the poker game coming up

that be how i read it but i be
reading it wrong
it be not lancey
or the game that be chewing at i
inside

what else be there could give you
such a bad time

i finally figure it
i locate where
the trouble be
it be you

oh

when you talk about do something
besides poker if i get to be the
man you do not mean pass up the chance
to make some dough from it for a
while

i sure do not
i told papa wherever
money come from it feel the same
when you spend it

down here

thanks kid
from you that be nice
to hear

when he bet out first he be ready
to think you have they back to back
even when he bet the size of the
pot he figure there be still a
chance you be laying for he
but
when you called he i could see it
in he eye he think you have jack
and tens and i know you have he
hook

you know do you
before i raised

oh sure i see what you be pulling
all along

you be to miami kid

not yet

beautiful town lot of loose money
around
you ought to come down some
time

you mean it

sure sure
lot of room down there
another spot you ought to work someday
be reno nevada

i hear

you get to have nerve though
so
much going on
action everywhere you
turn
you lose the feel of the card
when you be in so much action day
in day out

i would like to make it out there

there be different level of action
there you would find yours any kind
you could ask for

i generally stick to stud

sure sure for eating money
but
you know how it be i like to lay
off once in a while and try crap
nothing serious i do not even think
of it as work

oh i do that
i will take a night off
and shoot a little casino
or even
blackjack

you age you do not need a regular
vacation every year
but i i have
to forget the grind for a couple of
week
i go to this place near delray
beach and the whole time i do not
play anything but bridge

that be interesting
i could go for
bridge if there be a way to do it
without partner

i be not keeping you from you woman
be i

after a slight
hesitation
no
we be she be go away for a
while

for the same thing

i be sorry to hear that

i be hope christian would run
with i and would not try to make a
big deal out of it

but she tried

yeah and now i do not know
i do not
figure a man can change he way
because the way i see it a mane
lucky he be get something going for
he that he can hold on to
man
can not change he way for a woman

nooo a man can not do that

i be wonder if it be not maybe a
good idea not to look for a fix
thing
just tie in to something nice
when you be away from the action
and enjoy it and let it wear itself
out

that be very interesting you should
say that
you be pretty young to
have figure thing out already

well she do not understand how it
be with i and

between we

there be not but a few people i guess
who would understand

finish

see in year of action
