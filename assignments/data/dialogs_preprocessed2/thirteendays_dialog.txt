thousand mile threemegaton nuclear
warhead

jesus christ guy
what the hello
khruschev think

do you have any indication of this from
georgi
any possible warn or sense
of motivation

complete snowjob
and then we go out
and told the country they be not
putting missile into cuba
by the way you realize we just lost the
midterms

who give a shit about the midterms now
the soviet be putting nuclear weapon
ninety mile away from we

you mean there be something more
important than vote
do not think i would
live to see the day ken

jesus
i feel like we have catch the jap
carrier steaming for pearl harbor

good morning mr
president

good morning gentleman

dean good morning

mr
president

bob
bet you have a late night

sleep be for the weak mr
president

lyndon
adlai

max

McCones be notify and be coming
back from the west coast
carters
here though

ted

kenny

okay
let we have it

arthur Lundahl head we photographic
interpretation division at
i will
let he and he boy take you through
what we have get
arthur

gentleman as most of you now know a you
over cuba on sunday morning take a
series of disturb photograph



we analysis at indicate the
soviet union have follow it
conventional weapon buildup in cuba
with the introduction of surfaceto
surface mediumrange ballistic missile
or MRBMs
we official estimate at this
time be that this missile system be the
sandal
we do not believe these
missile be as yet operational

report the can deliver a
megaton nuclear weapon mile
so
far we have identified missile
serve by around man undoubtedly
all soviet personnel
we city and
military installation in the southeast
as far north as washington be in range
of these weapon and in the event of a
launch would only have five minute of
warn

five minute gentleman
five minute

in those five minute they could kill
million american and destroy a
significant number of we bomber base
degrading we retaliatory option
the
joint chief consensus be that this be
a massively destabilize move
upsetting the nuclear balance

arthur
be
you
sure

yes mr
president
these be nuclear
missile

how long until they be operational

general taylor can answer that question
well than i can



estimate ten to fourteen day
however a crash program to ready the
missile could cut that time

i have to stress that there may be more
missile that we do not know about
we
need more you coverage

be there any indication anything at
all that suggest they intend to use
these missile in some sort of first
strike

not at present sir
but i think the
prudent answer be we do not know

do we have any sort of intelligence from
on what khruschev be think

no mr
president
we do not
we just
do not know what be happening inside the
kremlin at that level

they lie to we
two week ago Dobrynin
told i to i face Khurschev have no
intention of putting missile into cuba
they said themselves this be we
backyard

gentleman i want first reaction
assume for a moment khruschev have not
go off the deep end and intend to
start world war three what be we
looking at

mr
president i believe i team be in
agreement
if we permit the
introduction of nuclear missile to a
soviet satellite nation in we
hemisphere the diplomatic consequence
will be too terrible to contemplate
the russian be trying to show the
world they can do whatever they want
wherever they want and we be powerless
to stop they
if they succeed

it will be munich all over again

appeasement only make the aggressor
more aggressive
confidence in we
security commitment around the world
will falter ally will become unsure
in the face of soviet pressure and the
soviet will be embolden to push we
even harder
we must remove the
missile one way or another
it seem
to i the option be either to build up
the crisis til they give in or we hit
they
an air strike

bob

we have work up several military
scenario
before i ask general taylor
to lead we through the various option
i would like for we to adopt a rule
if we be going to strike we must agree
now that we will do it before the
missile become operational
because
once they be i do not think we can
guarantee get they all before at
least some be launch

sir
we need to consider
if we
decide to act there be a good chance
we will end up in a general war

it be clear we cannot permit soviet
nuclear missile in cuba
we must get
those missile out

i do not think it be going to matter what
Khruschevs intention be
i tell you
right now
i do not see any way around
hitting they

if we hit they kill a lot of russian
they will move against berlin
they
attack berlin that be
and we be
at war

damned if we do but if we do not we be
in a war for sure somewhere else in six
month

no choice
this be going to cost live
any way we go
do nothing and it could
be million of ours
we have to get
rid of those missile

Thereve get to be alternative to just
going out and bombing they

he be right jack
taylor be saying we
may have some time
we have get to use
it

so if there be alternative that make
sense and i be not saying there be
we need they
need they fast

what about the ally
congress
i
think we may need to start letting key
people know
and they be all scattered
across the country for the campaign
we be going to need to get the you

staff in and warm up
jesus
i
do not even know if we have get secure
communication with half we embassy
since that the soviet get that
cryptographer of ours

we can not worry about everything right
now
we have get to figure out what we be
going to do before we worry about how we
do it

the other thing be

i know
and the military fucked
we on the bay of pig

they be going to be pressing for a
military solution soon
we can not afford
to let they ram they agenda down we
throat
we need to come with option
other than air strike so we have some
sort of choice here

we get a bunch of smart guy
we lock
they up together in there kick they in
the ass til they come up with option

i will do it

it be too politicized with you in there
anyway
they need to be able to stick
they neck out

it will be the principal a couple of the
key guy from each department
the
executive committee of the national
security council
we will call it


have a ring to it
like FTroop

okay
kenny and i only show for the
meeting you call we into
impress we
and do it fast
you be in charge of keeping this quiet
if word get out before we know what
we be going to do there be panic
and it will ruin any chance of surprise if
we decide to hit they

then we need to do a few thing right
away
no pierre
he know the press
know
you be going to have to keep up you
schedule you movement be follow
too closely
and we need to get these
guy out of the white house
george
ball get a conference room at state
reconvene over there this afternoon
come back here tonight

i think we should bring in dean acheson
he be fighting soviet while we be
still working the ward in boston

find he kenny
we be going to need
all the help we can get

hey kenny
who die

way it be going the democratic party
strategy session
if you can call
it that

sir

it be tuesday
you said to call
when
do i get i minute

tell you what
we be in connecticut
tomorrow for Ribicoff
i will get you up
front with he during the flight

deal

sir

what be it

the number you ask for

i ask for a lot of they
whose be it

dean Achesons sir

get to go scotty
see you tomorrow

screw secrecy
you try have that fat
ass sit on you lap all the way from
foggy bottom

you be excite
i say no more

everybody agree the diplomatic route be
out
it be too slow and they will have
the missile finished

we have plane assembling at
homestead eglin Opa Locka MacDill
patrick Pensacola and key west




due to the tropical foliage the
call for highexplosive and napalm
loadouts for we ground attack sortie

i still think there be diplomatic
approach we have not considered yet

we have high confidence in the expand
air strike option
the problem mr
president be that it be
a shortterm solution
khruschev can
send more missile next month
the
chief and i believe we should follow up
the air strike with the full version of


an invasion

yes sir
we can be sure we get all the
missile and we remove castro so this
can never happen again

be this the chief recommendation

yes sir
we good option be to
commence the strike before the missile
be operational
the invasion happen
eight day later

dean
what do you think

mr
president you have rightly
dismiss the diplomatic option
the
soviet will only tie you down in
negotiation and leave we short of we
goal the removal of the missile
negotiate will do nothing more than
give they time to make the missile
operational complicating the necessary
military task we have at hand

for the last fifteen year i have
fight here at this table along side
you predecessor in the struggle
against the soviet
gentleman i do not
wish to seem melodramatic but i do wish
to impress upon you one observation with
all conceivable sincerity
lesson i
have learned with bitter tear and great
sacrifice
the soviet understand only one
language
action
it respect only one
word
force

i concur with general taylor
i
recommend sir air strike follow by
invasion perhaps precede by an
ultimatum to dismantle the missile if
military necessity permit

then it appear we have three option
number one
surgical air strike
against the missile themselves
two a
large air strike against they air
defenses along with the missile

and three invasion

we be certainly going to do number one
we be going to take out these missile
so it seem to i we do not have to wait
very long
we ought to at least be
making those preparation

yes sir we be preparing to implement
all three option though i must stress
again sir there be risk to the
strike without the followon invasion

you want to be clear mr
president
that we have definitely decided against
a political track

dean how do this play out

you first step sir will be to demand
that the soviet withdraw the missile
within to hour
they will
refuse
when they do you will order
the strike follow by the invasion
they will resist but will be overrun
they will retaliate against a target
somewhere else in the world most likely
berlin
we will honor we treaty
commitment and resist they there
defeating they per we plan

those plan call for the use of nuclear
weapon
and what be the next step

hopefully cool head will prevail
before we reach the next step

if McNamarad get off the fence

we have time

goddamn it it be obvious
it be the only
option
that asshole stevenson
we
can not let this drag out or we lose we
shot

bombing they

remember that the kennedys father be
one of the architect of munich
the
general be right
there be only one
responsible choice here

let we pray appeasement do not run in
family
i fear weakness do

jesus christ almighty

call i irish but i do not believe in
cooler head prevailing

Achesons scenario be unacceptable
and
he have more experience than anyone

there be no expert on this subject no
wise old man

the thing be Achesons right
talk
alone will not accomplish anything

then let we bomb the shit out of they
everyone want to even you even i
it sure would feel good

jack i be as connive as they come but
a sneak attack be just wrong

he be right
and thing be happening
too fast
it smell like the bay of
pig all over again

as if dealing with the russian be not
hard enough we get to worry about we
own house

tonight listening to taylor and
acheson i keep seeing burke and dulles
telling i all i have to do be sign on
the dot line
the invasion would
succeed
castro would be go
just
like that
easy

there be something
immoral about
abandon you own judgement

we can not let thing get ahead of
themselves
we have get to control what
happen
we be going to do what we have to make
this come out right
be we first
weapon
we will resort to other as we need they



do not anybody in connecticut have to
work today

kenny
what happen
they do not let
i up front said the president be on
the phone the whole time

he be

yeah
who be he talking to
acheson
come on ODonnell everyone wonder
what be going on
what be acheson do
in town
and do not give i some
bullshit about think tank
Achesons mr
cold war

why do not you ask he yourself
you can
have he on the way home

i be giving you a chance here
talk to
i
you can influence how this thing
unfold



let we get out of here

cheer up you have neutralize the entire
white house press corps for a day

no
no
no
there be more than one
option here
if one be not occurring to
we it be because we have not think hard
enough

sometimes there be only one right
choice and you thank god when it be
clear

you be talking about a sneak attack
how will that make we look
big country
blast a little one into the stone
age
we will be real favorite around the
world

bobby that be naive
this be the real
world you know that good than
anybody
you argument be ridiculous

you be not so ethically particular when
we be talking about option for
remove castro over at

i can not let i brother go down in
history like a villain like a tojo
ordering another pearl harbor

bob
if we go ahead with these air
strike
there be get to be something else
give
it to i
i do not care how crazy
inadequate or stupid it sound
give it to i

six month ago we gamed out a scenario
it be slow
it do not get rid of the
missile
there be a lot of drawback
the scenario be for a blockade of cuba

the situation be bad than we think
we count missile now long range
IRBMs
they can hit every city in the
continental you


mr
president as of this moment i
plane be ready to carry out the air
strike
all you have to do be give i
the word sir and i boy will get
those red bastard

how long until the army be ready

we have just begin the mobilization under
cover of a prearrange exercise sir
we be looking at another week and a
half mr
president

but you can begin the strike now
the
plan call for an eightday air
campaign
it would light a fire under the
army ass to get in place

general LeMay do you truly believe
that be we good course of action

mr
president i believe it be the only
course of action
american be in
danger
those missile be a threat to
we bomber base and the safety of we
nuclear deterrent
without we
deterrent there be nothing to keep the
enemy from choosing general nuclear war
it be we duty we responsibility to the
american people to take out those
missile and return stability to the
strategic situation
the big red dog be
digging in we back yard and we be
justified in shooting he

sir we have a rapidly close window of
opportunity where we can prevent those
missile from ever becoming operational
the other option

do not guarantee the end result we
can guarantee
however the more time
that go by the less reliable the
choice we can offer you become

mr
president the motto i choose for
be peace be we profession
god
forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
exchange
but if launch those
missile in cuba would kill a lot of
american
that be why i be be such a
pain in the ass about destroy they
destroy they immediately
hell even
mac agree

general what will the soviet do when
we attack

nothing

nothing

nothing
because the only alternative
open to they be one they can not choose

those be not just missile we will be
destroy
we kill soviet soldier
and they will respond
how would we
respond if they killed ours
no they
will do something general i promise
you that
and i believe it will be
berlin

those goddamn kennedys be going to
destroy this country if we do not do
something about this

i be hope LeMay push you
i
would not mind going a few round with
he

we know it be coming
i tell you
kenny these brass hat have one big
advantage
we do what they want we to
none of we will be alive to tell they
they be wrong

mr
president gromyko should be on his
way by now

we need to go over what you be going to
say

there be still no sign they know that we
know about the missile
be a lot of
cloud cover
probably think we be not
get any good product

we keep they in the dark as long as we
can
but i sure as hell be going to
test he

kenny i be get funny question from
the guy in the press office
as press
secretary i need to know
what be going
on

they be planning to shave you bald next
time you fall asleep on the bus
sorry pierre gromyko just arrive

be they going to discuss the military
exercise going on in florida

come on scotty
this meet be on
the book for month
it be just a
friendly talk on you

soviet relation

so that there should be no
misunderstanding the position of the
united states which have be make clear
by the attorney general to ambassador
Dobrynin here i shall read a sentence
from i own statement to the press dated
september th
should missile or offensive weapon be
place in cuba it would present the
grave threat to you

national
security

mr
president this will never be do
you need not be concern

so i do not misunderstand you
there be
no offensive weapon in cuba

no mr
president
we have send
defensive weapon only to cuba

what happen

lying bastard
lie to i face

we be split down the middle
if i held
a vote i think airstrike would beat
blockade by a vote or two

i want a consensus bobby
consensus
either air strike or blockade
something everyone stand by even if
they do not like it
i need it by
saturday
make it happen

what if i can not

we go into this split the russian will
know it
and they will use it against we

have you cancel chicago and the rest
of the weekend yet

you do not show for chicago everyone
know there be something going on

i do not care
cancel it

no way

i be not calling and cancel on daly
you call and cancel on daly

you be scare to cancel on daly

damn right i be scare

well i be not

then you will call right

kenny all right
what be going on here
there be rumor going around an exercise
in the southeast be related to cuba
i be the press secretary
i can not do i
job if i do not know what be going on
so
what be going on

what be you telling they

the truth
i do not know

tell they you have look into it and all
it be be an exercise
and pierre
the president may have a cold tomorrow

damn it kenny
goddamn it

there be major rail disruption in the
south two airborne division be on
alert
that exercise be an invasion

well you know how bobby have it in for
the state of mississippi

this be about cuba

cuba
you be fucking crazy
we be not
invading cuba
nobody give a rate ass
about cuba
not now not ever
if you print something like that all
you be going to do be inflame the
situation
nobody talk to asshole who
inflame situation
asshole like that
can find themselves cut out of the loop

you have never threatened i before

all right
i be not going to print
anything until i have another source
but i promise you i will get one

tell pierre i need to talk to he
bobby

bring he back

the president have a cold
he be
cancel the remainder of this trip
and be returning to washington on the
advice of he doctor

mr
president we deliberation have
lead we to the conclusion that for the
moment a blockade of offensive weapon
to cuba be we good option
but we will
still need a strong show of support
from the organization of american state
to give we an umbrella of legitimacy

blockade be technically an act of war
therefore we recommend calling the
action a quarantine



there be between and soviet ship
underway to cuba at this time



mile out the navy will stop they
board and any vessel contain
weapon will be turn back


quarantine prevent more missile from
reaching cuba but it do not remove the
one already there
it give the
soviet a chance to pull back without
war
if they refuse to remove the
missile before they be operational we
retain the option to strike or invade

we believe that a surprise attack would
be counter to what the united states
stand for
we believe that an attack
leaf we no room for maneuver and the
inevitable soviet response will force we
into a war we do not want
war that
this time will really end all war

mr
president there be still those of
we who believe we should proceed with
the strike
with the blockade we lose
strategic surprise and we run the risk
of a first strike if the soviet decide
they have to use the missile or lose
they

quarantine or air strike

there be a third option
with either
course we undertake the risk of nuclear
war
it seem to i maybe one of we in
here should be a coward

so i guess i will be
we third choice be
to cut a deal
we trade guantanamo and
we missile in turkey get they to pull
they missile out
we employ a back
channel attribute the idea to you thant
you thant then raise it at the you


i do not think that be possible adlai
i will be asking the network for air
time monday night
i have not yet make
i final decision
we will announce we
course of action then
i want to thank
you all for you advice gentleman

Goddman stevenson
jesus
peace at any
price
you would think nobody learn
anything from world war two

somebody have to say it
i respect adlai
for have the guts to risk looking like
an appeaser

we have to pull he
he be not going to
be able to handle the soviet in front
of the you

zorin will eat he alive

we have get big problem right now

we have to try the blockade
it
probably will not work
it may just be
delaying the inevitable
but we can not
just go to war without trying not to

i do not know
i do not know

just can not get away from you guy
escape for a night on the town eh

as the town most popular playboy the
president feel i presence would be
sorely missed
so in the interest of
national security

get to keep up appearance
of course i
do not care anymore
i be a political
dead man
you ever see a man cut his
own throat like i do today

well it be all right
i come to tell you just talk to a
friend
reston and frankel have the
story

we be not going to make it to monday
i will try to lean on reston but you be
going to have to call orville Dryfoos
this be the sort of decision the
publisher make himself



yes sir i understand
but we held on
bay of pig and it be the big
mistake of i life
what make this any
different

i be asking you to hold the story until i
can present we course of action on
monday night

all right
but i need a reason to give
i boy
they be going to be screaming
for i head on a plate

orville
i want you to tell they this
they will be saving live
maybe even
including they own

have not hear from anyone else yet

he want to talk to LeMay again

cam can you guarantee i you will get all
the missile

sir i can guarantee we will get all the
missile we know about

mr
president we can get good than
ninety percent of they

as of seven of the clock monday night all
united states arm force world wide
will stand up to

you would worry that something be wrong if
congress offered you unconditional
support

they want this fuck job they can
have it
it be no great joy to i

the elected representative of the
people have spoken
beat
determined
now let we tell the people

good evening i fellow citizen
this
government as promise have maintained
the close surveillance of the soviet
military buildup on the island of
cuba



unmistakable evidence have now
established the fact that a series of
missile site be in preparation on that
imprison island
the purpose of these
base can be none other than to prove a
nuclear strike capability against the
western hemisphere



therefore in the defense of we own
security and under the authority of the
constitution i have directed that the
follow initial step be taken
first to halt this offensive buildup
a strict quarantine



on all offensive military equipment
under shipment to cuba be be
initiated
all ship of any kind bound
for cuba if find to contain cargo of
offensive weapon will be turn back
second
i have directed the continue
and increase close surveillance of cuba
and it military buildup
should these
offensive military preparation
continue far action will be
justified



i have directed the arm force to
prepare for any eventuality

and third
it shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear
missile launch from cuba against any
nation in the western hemisphere as an
attack by the soviet union on the united
state require a full retaliatory
response upon the soviet union

we be get the soviet response

this be all rhetoric
they do not know how to respond yet

so now you be Khurschev
what do you
do

run the blockade
they will run the
blockade

which be exactly what they appear to be
preparing to do mr
president
we be
tracking ship inbound to cuba
there be no sign they be changing course
the close ship the gagarin and the
Kimovsk will make the quarantine line
by this time tomorrow

we be concern about the possibility of
an incident with an innocent cargo
carrier
if it turn ugly the russian
could use an ugly incident and bad world
opinion as leverage to force we to
remove the quarantine

or they could use it as an excuse to
escalate

admiral anderson if the ship do not
stop what exactly be we rule of
engagement



Russianspeakers have be transferred
to all of we ship
once the
quarantine take effect in the morning
we ship will attempt to make radio
contact with the approaching vessel
they will be ordered to reduce speed and
prepare for inspection



an inspection party will then board and
search the ship
if weapon be find
the ship will be ordered to leave the
quarantine area or be tow into port
upon refusal

what happen if the ship do not stop
for inspection or want to be tow

warn shot will be fired across it
bow

and what happen if the ship ignore the
warn shot

then we fire at it rudder disable it
and carry out the inspection

there will be no shoot without i
explicit order
be that understood

yes sir

well admiral it look like it be up to
the navy

the navy will not let you down sir

general have we developed any more
information on the missile

they be continuing to proceed with the
development
we be commence lowlevel
photography run this morning

the picture will be used to firm up we
estimate of the missile readiness and
develop target package for strike
should you order they

we guy running this show be the good
commander bill ecker of the Navys
the Fightin photo
something of a
character but the high efficiency
rating we have ever have

millimeter i be listening
on the
big screen there be nothing like it



to protect we pilot we be prepare to
retaliate against any site or anti
aircraft battery that open fire

watch out hollywood
there be a new
epic director in town

we have a flight of Thunderchiefs able
to respond within minute of an attack
on we plane

i do not like what be happening

in the morning i be taking charge of the
blockade from the situation room
McNamarall set up shop in the flag plot
at the pentagon keep an eye on thing
there

all right
because you get arm
boarder climbing into soviet ship
shot be fired across bow

i know i know

what about these lowlevel flight
they be starting in what
an hour
do
you realize what you be letting yourself
in for

we need those flight
we have to know
when those missile become operational
because when they do we need to destroy
they

fair enough
but Castros on alert and
we be flying attack plane over they
site on the deck
there be no way for
they to know they be carrying camera
not bomb
they be going to be shoot at
plain and simple

i be you political advisor and i be
giving you political analysis here
this be a setup
the chief want to go
in
it be the only way they can redeem
themselves for the bay of pig
they
have to go in and they have to do it
right
it be that simple

i be going to protect those pilot

they be box we in with these rule of
engagement
if you agree to they and
one of we plane get knock down or
one of the ship will not stop for
inspection the chief will have we by
the ball and will force we to start
shoot
they want a war and they be
arrange thing to get one
if you
do not want one we have to do something
about it

how do a man get to a place where he
can say throw those live away so
easily

maybe it be hard for they to say it
than they let on
at the very least they believe it be in
we good interest
and at the end of
the day they may end up be right

triple check everything the chief say
to we with the guy who actually have to
do it
no one to know about this but
bobby
i need redundant control over
what happen out there
and if thing
be not as advertised you be going to
make sure they come out the way i want
they to come out starting with this low
level flight thing

that be going to be tough
you know how
these guy be about they chain of
command

any problem you remind they those
chain of command end at one place
i

mr
president
the meet start in
an hour

at you

sir it be a milk run sir

it appear we lowlevel flight be
get back okay
some unconfirmed
report of smallarms fire from some of
the mission but that be it

guess we can not blame khruschev for a few
patriotic farmer
and the ship

still heading for cuba

all right
then i guess it be time

in accordance with this afternoon vote
at the the quarantine shall hereby
be effective as of ten of the clock tomorrow
morning

last summer i read a book
the gun of
august
i wish every man on that
blockade line have read that book

world war one
thirteen million killed
all because the militaries of both
alliance be so highly attune to each
other movement and disposition
afraid of letting the other guy have a
theoretical advantage
and you man in
the field he family at home could not
even tell you the reason why they
live be be sacrifice
why could not they stop it

and here we be fifty year later
one
of they ship resist the inspection
we shoot out it rudder and board
they
shoot down we plane in response
we
bomb they antiaircraft site in
response to that
they attack berlin
we invade cuba
they fire they
missile
we fire ours



when be you going to be home

i do not know helen
i want you to keep
the kid close tomorrow
leave the

on sleep with it on in the bedroom
until i tell you you can turn it off



what be happen

nothing
nothing you do not know about
tomorrow the big day
just have the
car ready to go if i call or if the
civil defense warn come on



what happen to you
i be not leaving
without you

i will be evacuate with the president



great
so while you be under a rock
somewhere with the president what be i
suppose to do with you five child

i will find you
but we be not going to
let it come to that
i promise

helen just ask i what sort of
arrangement we have for the family

i just checked myself
they be be issued identity card
call come and evacuation officer meet
they at prearrange departure area
they go by helicopter to mount weather
we meet they there

course that be for morale
the missile
only take five minute to get here

would you like i to call a car mr
ODonnell

how long will it take to get someone up

fifteen minute maybe
to you house
sir

no
no i will let she sleep
let they
sleep

okay bob i be putting you on intercom



hey guy can you hear i


i have one minute til ten here

and no sign of they stopping

bob the quarantine be now in effect

then it look like we first customer
be the gagarin and Kimovsk

helm shape heading for intercept zero
one zero
all ahead full



new contact
new contact

submerged contact designation sierra
one at yard bearing

submarine

it be protecting the freighter

bob be there any way we can avoid
stopping a submarine first



i be afraid not mr
president
the sub
have position itself between the pierce
and the soviet ship
admiral anderson
insist it be too much of a risk to
proceed with stopping the freighter
the pierce would be a sitting duck for
the sub

put i through to the pierce

mr
president

captain can you force that submarine to
the surface for inspection without
damaging it yourself

i can bring it up mr
president
but
whether it be damaged or not be up to the
sub

even if they force it up that sub will
be inspect over the crew dead
body
they would be executed for allow
it when they get home

captain force the sub to the surface
for inspection



mr
president
we be receiving report
that the ship be stopping

captain belay that order
bob where be that coming from



just a second mr
president

will somebody find out what be going on

be they stopping



mr
president

we have get report coming from all
over
the ship be stopping
some
be turning around

we be eyeball to eyeball and i think
the other fellow just blink

mr
president

mr
president

sir we have the tally from
we
have twenty ship stopping and or
turning around
six however appear to
be continue for the line
including
the gagarin and Kimovsk

captain have the ship you be observe
change course



no mr
president
they have just cross
the quarantine line

it be an accident
they must not have
get they order yet
let they go

unlikely mr
president
we have be
monitor transmission from both the
gagarin and Kimovsk
they radio be
working fine

one ship an accident maybe
six
this
be intentional

they be right
this be intentional

Khruschevs stopped the ship which
be carrying contraband and he be
letting the one which be not go
through hope for an incident
i
think we should let they go

if we do it erode the credibility of
the quarantine
he will just send more
through tomorrow

then we deal with it tomorrow
but
today he be stopped most of they
he be
do something smart here
we give he
an ultimatum and he be agreed to most of
it preserving just enough room to save
face
we need to do something just as
smart now



mr
president i agree
let they go
four of the six continue ship be
still a day away from the line
they have
stopped all the one we suspect have
weapon aboard
it would look bad shooting up a
freighter full of baby food

captain i want you to maintain contact
with those ship
do nothing until i
order otherwise
be that clear



yes mr
president
contact only

i hope you be right

what happen to speak when spoken to

give it a rest
you be think the
same thing just do not have the guts to
take the heat

we can horsetrade with khruschev on
ship
but it do not get we any closer
to remove those missile

have to hope it be a signal that he will
back down on the real issue too

we be going to have to stop a ship
eventually show the quarantine get
tooth or we will prove McCone right

McNamaras on he way back here now
we
need to pick the right ship
no sub
no arm board party either
we
need a little more time to figure this
one out

then let we move the quarantine line

mr
president
bobby
kenny
the
essex battle group have the gagarin
Kimovsk and the sub escort under they
thumb
we have get a few hour now before
we need to worry about any more
flashpoint on the line
we could use a few more hour
i think
we should consider moving the quarantine
line back to mile

moving the line
stroke of genius

of course it be
but the president
need to realize we be going to have to
stop a ship eventually

the chief be looking for a provocation
out there
the president going to
come under enormous pressure
you have
to keep they on a short leash bob

you must think i be blind and stupid
i have already get the bird and bee
from bobby
the president do not have
to doublebarrel i

listen to i goddamn it
we be talking
about a possible nuclear war
you
drop the ball on bay of pig

you sonofabitch goddamn it i do not
drop

you be in the room
it be you
purview
it be you job to make sure
Bissel be not fucking we over and you
do not do it
you have get the most
important job in the world right now
you be the smart guy the president
have
besides i

anybody ever tell you you be an
egomaniac and a prick ODonnell

you need to be the good you have ever
be



well it appear the world have just
received a reprieve
defense secretary
robert mcnamara have announced that the
quarantine zone have be moved from
to mile

find out how close we exercise be
coming to they cruise missile
i be
calling you back in five and you will
have an answer for i or i will come
down there and beat the shit out of you
then you can press charge and i will get
a presidential pardon

how the goddamn hell do this happen
i be going to have power head on a
platter next to LeMays
hey kenny do you hear i give the
order to go to
i remember
giving the order to go to but
i must be suffering from amnesia because
i have just be informed we nuclear
force be




mr
president the order be limited
to we strategic force in the
continental you


technically general LeMay be correct
that have the statutory authority

i have the authority
i be the
commanderinchief of the united states
and i say when we go to war

we be not at war sir not until we be
at

general the joint chief have just
signal we intent to escalate to the
soviet
you have signal an
escalation which i have no wish to
signal and which i do not approve

LeMay
he be history

get out of here max

jesus

rescind the order
can all the chief
put nitze Gilpatric and the
Undersecretaries in charge

we can not do that bobby

he be right we can not rescind
the soviet will think we have get
sweet on they

and we can not purge the chief
we
invasion talk will look like a bluff
or even that there be be an attempt
coup

mcnamara will not be able to handle they
it be too much for one man
with all due respect to we heroic
fifth column

we have get Khruschevs attention with the
blockade
if we want a political
solution
i think it be time to turn up
the diplomatic heat
because if we let
this go on too long we be going to find
ourselves in a war

i have be consider a variation on one
of stevensons idea
we be going to
send up a trial balloon through Lippman
the jupiter missile

what do you think of Lippmans column
this morning

i think it be a bad idea

thank god
look everyone be furious
about it
we trade away we missile in
turkey and we be fucked politically

you get to stop they
we know it be jack
and Bobbys idea they leak it to
Lippman
the military guy be going
ape and they be not alone

then they should speak up

christ ken you know it be not that
easy

yes it be

no it be not
they do not trust the
people that feel this way
but these
people be right
and the kennedys be
wrong
we need you to tell they kenny
they will
listen to you

jack and bobby be good man
but it
take a certain character moral
toughness to stand up to

you listen to i
nobody nobody
talk about i friend that way
you be
fucking here right now because of the
kennedys
they may be wrong
they make
mistake
but they be not weak
the weak one be these people who
can not speak they own mind

you know i do not mean they be weak

no they just lack amoral toughness

and you think i will play you judas
you
and bluebloods never understood
we think we want into you club
well we get we own club now
and you guy do not realize fighting with

mr
president

the ship be called Groznyy



we lost track of it yesterday at
nightfall
we think we give it plenty
of room when we moved the quarantine
line back
we just reacquire it

it crossed the line hour ago

hail they again



keep we post bob

we be kidding ourselves

very well
load you gun

what be that admiral

we have be hail the Groznyy for the
last hour mr
secretary
the Groznyy
refuse to stop

what be you do

carry out we mission mr
secretary
if you do not mind we be very busy right
now
we need to be able to do we job

admiral i ask you a question

we be going to follow the rule of
engagement
the rule of engagement
which the president have approved and
signed in he order of october rd

yes captain you may proceed
clear
you gun

what



jesus christ god help we

that ship be firing starshells
Starshells
flare mr
secretary

Goddammitt i have get a job to do
you have be camp out up there since
monday night
you be exhaust and
you be making mistake
interfere with
i you will get some of killed
i will
not allow that

Starshells

get out of we way mr
secretary
the
navy have be running blockade since
the day of john paul jones

i believe the president make it clear
that there would be no fire on ship
without he express permission

with all due respect mr
secretary we
be not firing on the ship
firing on
a ship mean attack the ship
we
be not attack the ship
we be
firing over it

this be not the president intention
when he give that order
what if the
soviet do not see the distention
what
if they make the same mistake i just
do
there will be no firing anything near
soviet ship without i express
permission be that understood admiral

yes sir

and i will only issue such instruction
when ordered to by the president
john paul jones
you do not understand
a thing do you admiral

this be not a blockade

this all this be language a new
vocabulary the like of which the world
have never see
this be president kennedy communicate
with secretary khruschev



at
this morning the you


joseph
kennedy stopped and boarded the soviet
charter vessel Marcula



after a hour inspection the kennedy
signale no contraband find
clear
to continue
pentagon spokesman expect
the next encounter

kenny we need to see the president
something happen

i have lunch with he maybe once a
month
way he talk he act like he
know khruschev personally but he be
never elaborate
i have used he as a
source in a couple of story

the have identified this alexander
Fomin as the soviet resident the
equivalent of one of we station chief
he be they high rank spy in this
country
and he know johns a friend
of mine

all the trademark of a backchannel
overture

so they will remove the missile and
we will pledge not to invade cuba
destabilize castro or assist anyone who
plan in do so

i think
this may be we first real
message from khruschev

the alternative mr
president be that
this could be a trap

dangle a settlement tie we down in
negotiation we come up short

why else would they approach we in this
way
it be deniable
the soviet have
do nothing but lie to we
this could
be more of the same

that may be why Khruschevs introduce
this guy
we have be burned by his
usual player in the formal channel so
he bring in an honest broker

that may be what they want we to think

the truth be mr
president we do not
even really know whom Fomin speak for
it could be khruschev
it could be some
faction in the politburo or the
itself
we just do not know

by the way Scali you activity now
fall under the secrecy codicil of the
national security act
sorry no
pulitzer

mr
president we do not have much time
i be suppose to meet with he again in
three and a half hour

well it seem the question of the day
be be the offer legitimate

if it be
if it be then we can not
afford to ignore it
john we will have instruction for you in
a couple of hour

mr
president i be afraid we have some
bad news
we be get estimate
from we late lowlevel overflight
it appear the missile be two to three
day away from operational status

so we do not have much time to play out
backchannel communique

the quarantine sir be not producing
result
the chief feel it be time you
take another look at we option

kenny get over to you old stomp
ground
go through everything the
have on Fomin
i need you good call
be
this guy legit and be he speaking for
khruschev
and i need you to tell i by
the time i call you because right after
i call you i be calling Scali with he
instruction

okay
so what we have get be this guy
alexander Feklisov aka alexander Fomin
declared consul to the soviet embassy
but in reality the papa spy
an
illustrious tour of duty during the
great patriotic war get he on the
party fast track various tour of duty
in american posting
he be an
expert on we and
that be all we have
get on papa spy

who be he talking for
be it khruschev
or be this more bullshit

how do you become the top spy in the
united states

get to know someone

politics be politics
walter
khruschev be the moscow party boss under
stalin
give i they career
chronology

every time khruschev move up Fomin
do within a year
khruschev be the administrator in
charge of preparing Moscows defenses
during the war
and Fomin
be here
in the you


not at first

he be an engineer station outside
moscow in
specialize in tank
trap

they know each other
they be war
buddy

it be thin
but real life usually be

hello



i have get to move
what do you have
kenny

they know each other
khruschev and
Feklisov aka Fomin be war buddy



you be sure

do not take it to court but we have get
good circumstantial evidence
walter agree
i gut telling i
Khruschevs turning to a trust old
friend to carry he message



okay ken
we be going

i be instruct to tell you that the
american government would respond
favorably to an offer along the line
you have discuss
if this solution
be raised at the you

by ambassador
zorin he would find a favorable reply
from ambassador stevenson

so i understand you correctly
if the
missile in cuba be dismantle
return to the soviet union and a
guarantee be make not to reintroduce
they the united states would be
prepared to guarantee that it would
never invade cuba

that be correct

this be from the high authority

yes
from the high authority
there
be two condition
the you

must be allow to inspect the removal
of the missile

and of course the you

must be allow
to observe the redeployment of force
from the american southeast

and the second condition

time be of the essence

john
how much time

hour
in hour there can be no
deal

he left right away
get the feel he
mean business

mr
president we be receiving a letter
from khruschev over at state

two
of
we
pull
on
the
knot
of
war

it be ten page of sentimental fluff but
he be saying right here
he will remove
the missile in return for a noinvasion
pledge
it look like Fomins overture
be genuine

we early analysis say this be
probably written by khruschev himself
it be a first draft and show no sign
of be polished by the foreign
ministry
in fact it probably have not
be approved by the politburo
they
would not have let the emotionalism go
by
the analyst say it be written by
someone under considerable stress

glad to hear we be not alone

well gentleman i be not planning on
invading cuba anyway
i think we can
live with the term of this deal

ted i want you to draft we acceptance

hi

hi ODonnell
you look old

this job going to kill you
if i
do not first

if you be home it mean either jack and
bobby have finally figure out what a
con man you be and fired you or

we get a back channel communication
from khruschev this evening feeling we
out about a deal
he confirmed it just
a little while ago in a letter to the
president
i think we have win

thing like this
who could even
think of winning

where have you be
we have be trying to
find you all morning

helen and i go out for breakfast
EXCOMs not suppose to convene til
eight

we just get a second letter from
khruschev
the deal off



we be get everyone together as fast
as we can

what do the letter say

they want we to take we missile out of
turkey along with the no invasion
pledge
it look like Fomin be a ploy
after all and they be just stall
for time

it get bad

i specialist be in agreement
this
morning letter be not khruschev
last
night letter be
the evidence support only one
conclusion
there have be a coup and
khruschev be replace overnight

jesus christ

dean

it do not necessarily mean there be be
a coup
Khruschevs name be signed to
the letter

aw come on dean

but at the very least
it do suggest
he be be coopt by hard line
element

which at the end of the day be the same
thing as a coup
puppet khruschev
and a hardline soviet government
pulling the string
no deal
and the
missile be almost operational

you know the problem we have be that
this be late offer of theirs will seem
reasonable to everyone
we remove we
missile they remove theirs
we Jupiters be scheduled for removal
anyway
they be obsolete after all

mr
president agree to such a trade
would be tantamount to paying ransom
they will put a gun to we head again and
expect we to pay again

we can not sell out one of we friend for
we own safety
would not trust we
anymore and they would be right not to

so which one of you genius can tell i
how to explain ourselves to the world
how do we work with they if there be be
a hardline coup

mr
president there be another
possibility we have not considered
this
may not be a coup at all

it be possible that the backchannel
overture last night letter and this
letter today along with everything the
soviet have say all along be nothing
more than a lie disinformation

design to keep we from taking action

i hate to say it but if i have to bet
i would bet max be right
what if they have
no intention of honoring this deal
either
then tomorrow they add another
condition
meanwhile the quarantine
be not working and they be continuing to
work on the missile site
i think we have to consider issue
warn order for we force

mr
president

this morning photography be in
it
appear the soviet have commence a
crash program to ready the missile




the first missile become operational
last night



we expect they will all be operational in
hour
monday morning


then we be out of time
we have to go
in

that may not be as easy as we think
either
we have get confirmation that
the soviet have also deploy
battlefield nuclear weapon to cuba

we call they
short range
tactical nuke
it be possible they have
delegate release authority to they
local commander for use against we
invasion troop
it would be standard
doctrine
we capability to get all the missile
have eroded during we delay with the
quarantine
the good news be that for
the moment we know where the be
and we can target they too
but the
longer we wait the hard it be going to
get

then we have no choice
general issue the warn order to we
force
they will be prepared to
execute the air strike monday morning
and the followon invasion accord to
the schedule thereafter
i will need the
official release order on i desk
sunday night

understood sir
we need to step up the
overflight finalize we pilot target
folder in order to be able to carry out
the strike

permission grant

gentleman if anybodies get any great
idea now the time

this be major anderson




hello
anyone there

major i name be kenneth ODonnell
special assistant to the president

major a few day ago the president
ordered i to help he keep control of
what be going on out there
i have be
browbeating pilot navy guy left and
right to make sure you do not get we here
in washington into trouble
but you
know what
we be pretty damn good at
get ourselves into trouble
so
instead of riding you ass i be just
going to tell you what be going on and
let you figure out how best to help we
out up here

go ahead sir

last night we look like we be going
to cut a deal to get we all out of this
mess
today the soviet be renege
we be going to try to salvage the
situation but a lot of thing be going
wrong today
it be making everyone
nervous and it will be very hard to
avoid going to war
do not get shot
down major
beyond that whatever else
you can do to help we i would really
appreciate it

when you be up there at foot
there be a million thing that can go
wrong
be you oxygen mix right
will
you camera freeze up
be you leaving
contrail
those million thing be beyond you
control mostly
but you know when
you realize that there be a kind of
peace
you do not need to be in control
you never be in control in the first
place
if you be a good man and you
ground crew be good man it be all you
can ask for
and with the grace of Gd
it will get you through

you sound like a good man
you will be
all right mr
ODonnell
we believe in
you guy down here
thanks for the call

thank you major

this be flight request
permission for takeoff



you have get runway one you be
clear to proceed to angel

roger that




kenny

do this attack on we plane represent
a definitive intentional escalation on
the part of the soviet

the soviet be in control of the sams
it be hard to believe with they
centralize command structure that it
could be an accidental launch

mr
president taken with the event of
the past few hour i believe this
confirm we bad fear
we be now
dealing with a hardline soviet
government perhaps with khruschev as a
puppet head perhaps not

it could be a mistake

we need to be positive before we react

you on a routine airsampling mission
over siberia get lost and penetrate
soviet airspace
the soviet scrambled
mig in pursuit think it be a
bomber
it get out okay
somebody
forget to cancel the mission

Goddammitt
there be always some
sonofabitch who do not get the word
all we need be the soviet think
we be bombing they
anybody else

mr
president we pilot be in danger
we must order punitive airstrike
against the site that shoot down
major anderson per we rule of
engagement

no
i want confirmation there be not
some sort of accident first

i think that be a good idea mr
president
it will be safe for i boy
to get those sams on monday when we get
the rest of the bastard
i can wait a
day and a half

very well then

hey
dad

hey sport
you winning

yeah

be everything going to be okay dad

yeah kev
Everythings going to be fine

i guess you will not be coming home
tonight

i uh

kenny
we need to talk

get back out there kid
remember to
hit they hard

what about you
where be you going

back to work

if we be going to make a deal we be
going to have to do it fast
this be
only get out of control
the only
reason we be not at war this very minute
be he be be able to stretch bend and
break he own rule
he will not be able
to keep it up forever

and

and jack want to trade the missile in
turkey

the Jupiters be obsolete
they be
suppose to have be dismantle last
summer anyway

jesus mary and joseph
i told you
how stupid it be to float the Lippman
article
but you would not listen to i
what if there have not be a coup at all
what if it be you two who invited that
second letter by raising the possibility
of a trade

and if the two of you be think this
trade be you ace in the hole you be so
wrong
it be a deuce

and it be not just i who think that
everyone on this socalled be
telling you exactly the same thing
make
the trade and they be going to force we
into trade after trade until finally
they demand something we will not trade
like berlin and we do end up in a war
not to mention that long before that
happen this government will be
politically dead

all right so maybe we overestimate how
reasonable this trade would look
okay
you happy
so now what

so now you have get to talk he out of it
and then we have get to figure out an
acceptable political solution

and if there have be a coup and there
be no acceptable political solution

whatever response we send it will take
several hour for the wire to be
received by we embassy and deliver to
the kremlin
so we be looking at early
tomorrow morning at the early before
khruschev could respond

he get it but he be piss

that be all well and good but what do we
say to they

it depend on if we really believe
there be be a coup

i agree
if there have be a coup and
there be a hardline government in power
now then it do not matter what we say
the end of the day we will either agree to
they term they will agree to ours or
we will go to war
but what if there
have not be a coup
what if
what if
what be happening be a series of
accident

the second letter be an accident

no
the letter be an intentional but
it be have an effect far great than
it author intended
what if we jupiter missile be just a
last minute haggle to salvage something
maybe a bone khruschev be throwing to
the hard line not really caring if we
reject it or not
and then these accident have happen

making the second letter and the overall
picture look bad than it really be

the gun of august

exactly
if they be sane and human like we be
then maybe we just refuse and they will
let it slide like we have be letting
thing slide

so we reject the second letter

no
we do not reject it

we accept the first letter and
pretend the second do not exist



it will not work

because it be wishful think
it be
the same wishful think that blind
we all these month while the soviet
be sneak those missile in under
we nose

ignore the second letter agree to the
condition of the first

there be no reason to believe the soviet
will let it go

max be right
why will they accept it

it can work
if they believe we will
hit they

we have only get time for one more round
of diplomacy
the first airstrike
start in less than hour

but we have to make they agree to it
so how do we do that

we give they something
we tell they
we will remove the missile from turkey
say six month from now so that there
appear to be no linkage
we also tell
they if they go public about it we deny
it and the deal be off

and we do it under the table so we can
disavow any knowledge of it

it be transparent
the press be all
over it

six month from now i be not going to
care
be you
we will deal with it

at least it will expose whether
khruschev have be overthrow
we will
know what we be dealing with

and if this be a move to appease the
hard line then it may just be the bone
he need to regain control of he own
house

whoever carry the message have to hit
the nail on the head
come across as
too soft they will push we
too hard
they will be cornered and even more
dangerous

they could preempt

bobby
you know Dobrynin best

ted you get working on the draft

and make sure he know we have to have
an answer tomorrow
because on monday we begin military
action against cuba

what be the matter with you
forget how
to open a car door

jesus you rich people

i do not know if i can do this

there be nobody else i would rather have
going in there

nobody else i would trust helen and the
kid life to

take a left

we give so much to get here
i do not
know
sometimes i think what the hell
do we do it for

because we know we could do a good job
than everyone else

you know
i hate be called the
brilliant one
the ruthless one
they
guy who do the dirty work
the one
everybody afraid of

i hate it
i be not smart you know
and i be not so ruthless

you be right about the smart part but
ruthless well

slow down
smell that

smoke

just wanted to see for myself
they be burning they document

they think we be going to war
Gd help
we ken

sir ambassador Dobrynin be already
here
we have he waiting in you
office

i will whistle up some luck for you

who be you

the friend

ambassador Dobrynin we be aware that
at this moment you missile in cuba be
at the brink of operational readiness




they be a vital threat to i country
if launch they would kill million
american


i brother i friend i countryman
and i cannot and will not permit those
missile to become operational
i promise you that

then i fear we two nation will go to
war
and i fear where war will lead we

if the missile do not become
operational if you remove the missile
then there will be no war
at this moment the president be
accepting the term of secretary
Khruschevs letter of friday night
if
the soviet union halt construction
immediately remove the missile and
submit to you

inspection the united
states will pledge to never invade cuba
or aid other in that enterprise

if you jupiter missile in turkey be
remove also such an accommodation
could be reach

the united states cannot agree to such
term under threat
any belief to the
contrary
be in error

you want war

however while there can be no quid pro
quo on this issue the united states can
offer a private assurance

we jupiter missile in turkey be
obsolete and have be scheduled for
withdrawal for some time
this
withdrawal should be completed within
say six month

of course any public disclosure of this
assurance would negate the deal and
produce the most stringent denial from
we government

this private assurance represent the
word of the high authority

yes

and it can be relay beyond comrade
Khruschevs ear to the top circle of
i government

of course
we pledge can be relay to
any government official secretary
khruschev see fit to satisfy

with the caveat that it be not make
public in any way shape or form
and we must have an answer tomorrow at
the late
i cannot stress this point
enough

tomorrow

tomorrow

then you must excuse i and permit i to
relay the substance of we discussion to
i superior

we have hear story that some among
you military man wish for war
you be a good man
you brother be a
good man
i assure you there be other
good man
let we hope the will of good
man be enough to counter the terrible
strength of this thing which have be
put in motion



we be out here

we be just debating who have it bad
we or george washington and he guy

he do not have to worry about nuclear
weapon

yeah but the country do not even exist
as a country yet
it be a mess and he
do not have a leg to stand on

all he have be he character

how do a guy get a rep like that

do not matter to i
if i go down in
history like adams i would die happy
all

and that be all there be between we and
the devil

kenny
it be over



this be radio moscow
moscow call



the follow statement be the text of a
letter from general secretary khruschev
to president kennedy



i regard with respect and trust the
statement you make in you message of
october that there would be no
attack no invasion of cuba and not
only the part of the united states but
also on the part of the western
hemisphere as you said in you same
message
then the motive which induced
we to render assistance of such a kind
to cuba disappear



it be for this reason that we have
instruct we officer these
missile as i already informed you be
in the hand of soviet officer to take
appropriate measure to discontinue
construction dismantle they and return
they to the soviet union

victory with the soviet
