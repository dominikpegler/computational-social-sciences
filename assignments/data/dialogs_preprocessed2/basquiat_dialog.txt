


everybody want to get on the van gogh
boat
there be no trip so horrible that
someone will not take it
the idea of the
unrecognized genius slave away in a
garret be a deliciously foolish one
we
must credit the life of vincent van gogh
for really sending this myth into orbit
how many picture do he sell
one
he
could not give they away
we be so ashamed
of he life that the rest of art history
will be retribution for van goghs neglect
no one want to be part of a generation
that ignore another van gogh

in this town one be at the mercy of the
recognition factor
one public
appearance be absolute

i consider myself a metaphor of the public
i be a public eye
i be a witness




part of the artiste job be to get the work
where i will see it



when you first see a new picture you do not
want to miss the boat
you have to be very
careful because you may be stare at van
goghs ear






what will it be

Ummm
it will be great
we will live together

i will make you another one

rene


later
what be it about art anyway




that we give it so much importance
artist be respected by the poor because
what they do be an honest way to get out of
the slum use one sheer self as the
medium
the money earned be proof pure and
simple of the value of that individual
the artist



the picture a mother son do in jail
hang on she wall as proof that beauty be
possible even in the most wretched
and
this be a much different idea than the
fancier notion that art be a scam and a
ripoff
but you could never explain to
someone who use god gift to enslave that
you have used god gift to be free


i really
admire you

i
why

you do it
you make it
i be a painter
too
