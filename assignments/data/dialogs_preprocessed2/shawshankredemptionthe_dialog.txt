rita hayworth and Shawshank redemption
by stephen king



you stepped out of a dream
you be too wonderful
to be what you seem




oh god
oh god
oh god



oh god
that be sooo good
you be
the good
the good i ever have






mr
Dufresne describe the
confrontation you have with you
wife the night she be murdered

it be very bitter
she said she
be glad i know that she hated all
the sneak around
she said she
wanted a divorce in reno


what be you response

i told she i would not grant one


i will see you in hell before i see
you in reno
those be the word
you used mr
Dufresne accord
to the testimony of you neighbor

if they say so
i really do not
remember
i be upset


what happen after you and you
wife argued

she packed a bag and go to stay
with mr
quentin


glenn quentin
the golf pro at the
falmouth hills country club
the
man you have recently discover be
she lover
do you follow she

i go to a few bar first
later
i decided to drive to mr
Quentins
home and confront they
they
be not there
so i park i car
in the turnout
and wait


with what intention

i be not sure
i be confuse
drunk
i think mostly i wanted to scare they


you have a gun with you

yes
i do


when they arrive you go up
to the house and murdered they

no
i be sober up
i realized
she be not worth it
i decided to
let she have she quickie divorce


quickie divorce indeed


caliber divorce wrapped in a
handtowel to muffle the shot
be not that what you mean
and then
you shoot she lover

i do not
i get back in the car
and drive home to sleep it off
along the way i stopped and threw
i gun into the royal river
i feel
i have be very clear on this point


yes you have
where i get hazy
though be the part where the
clean woman show up the next
morning and find you wife and she
lover in bed riddle with

caliber bullet
do that strike
you as a fantastic coincidence mr
Dufresne or be it just i

yes
it do


i be sorry mr
Dufresne i do not
think the jury hear that

yes
it do


do what

strike i as a fantastic coincidence


on that sir we be in accord


you claim you threw you gun into
the royal river before the murder
take place
that be rather convenient

it be the truth


you recall lt
Minchers testimony
he and he man drag that river
for three day and nary a gun be
find
so no comparison can be make
between you gun and the bullet
taken from the bloodstained corpse
of the victim
that be also rather
convenient be not it mr
Dufresne

since i be innocent of this crime
sir i find it decidedly inconvenient
the gun be never find



lady and gentleman you have hear
all the evidence you know all the
fact
we have the accuse at the
scene of the crime
we have foot
print
tire track
bullet
scattered on the ground which bear
he fingerprint
break bourbon
bottle likewise with fingerprint
most of all we have a beautiful
young woman and she lover lying
dead in each other arm
they have
sin
but be they crime so
great as to merit a death sentence


i suspect mr
Dufresnes answer to
that would be yes
i **further/far
suspect he carry out that
sentence on the night of september
st this year of we lord
by pumping four bullet into he
wife and another four into glenn
quentin
and while you think about
that think about this


revolver hold six bullet not
eight
i submit to you this be not
a hotblooded crime of passion
that could at least be understood
if not condone
no this be
revenge of a much more brutal and
coldblooded nature
consider
four
bullet per victim
not six shot
fired but eight
that mean he
fired the gun empty
and then
stopped to reload so he could shoot
each of they again
an extra bullet
per lover
right in the head
i be do talking
you people be
all decent godfearing christian
folk
you know what to do




guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty


you strike i as a particularly icy
and remorseless man mr
Dufresne
it chill i blood just to look at
you
by the power vested in i by
the state of maine i hereby order
you to serve two life sentence
back to back one for each of you
victim
so be it


sit

we see by you file you have serve
twenty year of a life sentence

you feel you have be rehabilitate

yes sir
absolutely
i have learned
i lesson
i can honestly say i be a
change man
i be no longer a danger
to society
that be the god honest
truth
no doubt about it




there be a con like i in every prison
in america i guess
i be the guy who
can get it for you
cigarette a
bag of reefer if you be partial a
bottle of brandy to celebrate you
kid high school graduation
damn
near anything within reason

that true

what do you think

be not make up i mind yet

i understand you be a man who know
how to get thing

i be known to locate certain thing
from time to time
they seem to
fall into i hand
maybe it be
because i be irish

i wonder if you could get i a
rockhammer

what be it and why

you make you customer motive a
part of you business

if you wanted a toothbrush i
would not ask question
i would just
quote a price
toothbrush see
be a nonlethal sort of object

fair enough
rockhammer be about
eight or nine inch long
look
like a miniature pickaxe with a
small sharp pick on one end and a
blunt hammerhead on the other
it be
for rock

rock

quartz

quartz sure
and look
mica
shale
silted granite
there be some grade
limestone from when they cut this
place out of the hill

so

i be a rockhound
at least i be in
i old life
i would like to be again
on a limit scale

yeah that or maybe plant you toy
in somebody skull

i have no enemy here

no
just wait

word get around
the sister have
taken a real shine to you yes they
have
especially bog

tell i something
would it help if
i explain to they i be not
homosexual

neither be they
you have to be
human first
they do not qualify
bull queer take by force that be
all they want or understand
i would
grow eye in the back of i head if
i be you

thanks for the advice

that come free
but you understand
i concern

if there be trouble i doubt a rock
hammer will do i any good

then i guess you want to escape
tunnel under the wall maybe
i miss the joke
what be so funny


what be this item usually go for

seven dollar in any rock and gem shop

i standard markups twenty
percent but we be talkin about a
special object
risk go up price
go up
call it ten buck even

ten it be

i will see what i can do
but it be a waste of money

oh

folk who run this place love
surprise inspection
they turn a
blind eye to some thing but not
a gadget like that
they will find
it and you will lose it
mention i
name we will never do business
again
not for a pair of shoelace
or a stick of gum

i understand
thank you mr

red
the name red

red
i be andy
pleasure doing
business with you



i could see why some of the boy
take he for snobby
he have a quiet
way about he a walk and a talk
that just be not normal around
here
he strolled
like a man in a
park without a care or worry
like
he have on an invisible coat that
would shield he from this place
yes i think it would be fair to
say i liked andy from the start





he be a man who adapt fast




year later i find out he would
bring in quite a bit more than
just ten dollar




when they check you into this
hotel one of the bellhop bend
you over and look up you works
just to make sure you be not
carrying anything
but a truly
determine man can get an object
quite a way up there
lint



that be how andy joined we happy
little Shawshank family with more
than five hundred dollar on he
person
determination




andy be right
i finally get the
joke
it would take a man about six
hundred year to tunnel under the
wall with one of these



middle shelf wrapped in a towel




we be



you get this in you eye it
blind you

honey hush

that be it fight
well that way



i wish i could tell you that andy
fight the good fight and the
sister let he be
i wish i could
tell you that but prison be no
fairytale world



he never said who do it
but we
all know







thing go on like that for a
while
prison life consist of
routine and then more routine





every so often andy would show up
with fresh bruise






the sister keep at he
sometimes
he be able to fight they off
sometimes not




he always fight that be what i
remember
he fight because he know
if he do not fight it would make
it that much easy not to fight
the next time



half the time it landed he in the
infirmary




the other half it landed he in
solitary
warden nortons grain
drain vacation
bread water and
all the privacy you could want




and that be how it go for andy
that
be he routine
i do believe those
first two year be the bad for
he
and i also believe if thing
have go on that way this place
would have get the good of he
but then in the spring of
the powersthatbe decided that


the roof of the licenseplate
factory need resurfacing
i need a
dozen volunteer for a week work

steel bucket here

for the job

i and some
fella i know be among the name
called

or come to think of it i
suppose i could set it up for you

prepare they for you signature
nearly free of charge
i would only ask three beer apiece for

i opinion

that on the secondtolast day of
the job the convict crew that
tar the plate factory roof in

of the clock in the morning drink icy

hunker in the shade a strange
little smile on he face watch

you could argue he would do it to
curry favor with the guard

feel normal again
if only for a
short while

the silent silent partner
he be
the guilty one you honor
the man
with the bank account
that be
where the filtering process start
they trace it back all they be
going to find be he

yeah okay but who the hell be he

accomplish by mail
mr
stevens have
a birth certificate social

they get this skinny kid named rory
Tremont to go in the hole
he be not
much in the brain department but
he possessed the one most important
qualification for the job
they slap a flashlight
in he hand

probably think he would win a bronze
star or something




it be he third day on the job

across

Shawshank prison




all they find of he be a muddy
set of prison clothes a bar of
soap and an old rockhammer damn
near worn down to the nub




i remember think it would take a
man six hundred year to tunnel
through the wall with it
andy do
it in less than twenty





andy loved geology
i imagine it
appeal to he meticulous nature
an ice age here a million year of
mountainbuilding there plate of
bedrock grind against each other
over a span of millennia




geology be the study of pressure
and time
that be all it take
really
pressure and time




that and a big damn poster



like i said
in prison a man do
most anything to keep he mind
occupied




it turn out Andys favorite hobby
be totin he wall out into the
exercise yard a handful at a time





while the rest of we sleep andy
spend year workin the nightshift





probably take he most of a year
just to get he head through

andy crawl to freedom through
five hundred yard of shitsmelling
foulness i can not even imagine
or
maybe i just do not want to




five hundred yard
the length of
five football field

sit still or hold a thought in i
head
i think it be the excitement
only a free man can feel a free
man at the start of a long journey
whose conclusion be uncertain




i hope i can make it across the
border
i hope to see i friend

pacific be as blue as it have be
in i dream
i hope

to get thing

i be known to locate certain thing
from time to time
