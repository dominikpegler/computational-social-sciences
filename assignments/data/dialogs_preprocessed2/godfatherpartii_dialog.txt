senator chief aide a man named
turnbull
turnbulls a heavy
gambler and into we for over a
hundred grand so i figure his
information be reliable

the senator can be set up
but he
think of himself as a clean
politician
so it be get to be on
term he can live with
campaign
contribution donation to a
charitable because that he control
thing like that
if he get even
the inkling that you think you be
buying he he will freeze up
Nevadas a funny state they like
thing both way here
all right
turnbull say the senator will be
here at twothirty and he be be
primed
he know you will want to
meet with he alone and he know
it be about the Tropicanas license
at any rate he expect to be
introduced around to some of the
influential people here today and
generally treated as an ordinary
guest
just go light on he
mikey sometimes the big crook
do not like to think of themselves
as crook

maybe more
frank than any man in i position
have ever spoken to you before

the corleone family control two
major hotel in vegas
one in reno
the license be grandfathered in
so you have no difficulty with the
gaming commission
but i have the
idea from source
take the water from
neri and swallow he pill
that you be planning to move in
on the tropicana
in another week
or so you will move klingman out
which leaf you with only one
technicality
the license which
be now in Klingmans name

turnbull be a good man

let we forget the bullshit i do not
want to stay here any longer than i
have to
you can have the license
for two hundred and fifty thousand
in cash plus a monthly fee equal
to five percent of the gross

of all three corleone hotel

senator geary i speak to you as a
businessman who have make a large
investment in you state
i have
make that state i home
plan to
raise i child here
the
license fee from the gambling
commission cost one thousand
dollar
why would i ever consider
paying more

i be going to squeeze you corleone
because i do not like you
i do not
like the kind of man you be
i
despise you masquerade and the
dishonest way you pose yourself and
you fuck family

we be all part of the same
hypocrisy senator
but never
think it apply to i family

all right then let i say you will
pay i because it be in you
interest to pay i

i will expect you answer with
payment by tomorrow morning
only
do not contact i
from now on
deal only through turnbull

senator
you can have i answer now if
you would like

i offer be this
nothing
not
even the thousand dollar for the
gaming commission which i would
appreciate if you would put up
personally

clemenza promised Rosato three
territory in the bronx after he

see you and you wife and child

of course if i information as to
you gain be incorrect i will dip

just a
little but no less than one
hundred dollar and do not try to
deceive i eh paisan

i two friend have i share of the
money

after we deliver these to the
wholesaler

three hundred dollar

what if we do not pay

you know he friend

cop and earn they gratitude
then they would owe he a favor
that be how he operate
we will have
to pay
three hundred be we
agreed

what can we do

they say Fanucci have a license from
Maranzalla himself to work this
neighborhood

if you like why not give i fifty
dollar each to pay Fanucci
i
guarantee he will accept that
amount from i

when Fanucci say two hundred he
mean two hundred
you can not talk
with he

i will reason with he
leave
everything in i hand
i will
settle this problem to you
satisfaction

i never lie to people i have accepted
as i friend
speak to Fanucci
yourself tomorrow
let he ask you
for the money but do not pay it
and do not in any way quarrel with
he
tell he you have to get the

the united states who will put up
we share for a small piece of the
action yet we will retain control

how much

hundred million dollar
but
only if this government relax it
restriction on importing build
material
we will need some new
law too but that will be no
difficulty

what be import duty now

as much as seventy percent
also
i be working out an arrangement with
the minister of labor so that all
we pit boss stickmen and
dealer can be considered
specialize technician eligible
for two year visa
as of now
they be only allow in cuba for
six month at a time
in short
we be in a full partnership with
the cuban government

here be application from friends
all over the states
i understand
santo virgilio in tampa be trying
to make he own deal
well the
cuban government will brush he off
the Lakeville road boy be going
to take over the Nacionale here
i be planning a new hotel casino to
be known as riviera
the new capri
will go to the corleone family

then there be the sevilla biltmore
the havana hilton which be going
to cost twentyfour million

generally there will be friend
for all we friend including the
lieutenant governor of nevada
eddie levine of newport will bring
in the Pennino brother dino and
eddie
they will handle actual casino
operation

enjoy

i see an interesting thing today
man be be arrested by the
military police
probably an urban
guerrilla
rather than be taken
alive he exploded a grenade hidden
in he jacket taking the command
vehicle with he

it occur to i
the police be
paid to fight and the rebel be
not

so

so that occur to i

this country have have rebel for the
last fifty year
it be part of
they blood
believe i i know
i have be coming here since the
twenties
we be running molasses
out of havana when you be a baby
to truck owned by you father
he chuckle warmly
over the memory
we will talk when we be alone

you have to be careful what you say
in front of the other
they
frighten easy
it be always be
that way most man frighten easy

we be making a big investment in
cuba
that be i only concern

i concern be that the three
million never arrive at Batistas
numbered account in switzerland
he think it be because you have
second thought about he ability
to stop the rebel

the money be send

then you have to trace it
michael
people here look at i as a reliable
man
i can not afford not to be
look on as a reliable man
but
you know all that
there be nothing
you can learn from i
you
should not have to put up with a
sick old man as a partner

i would not consider anyone else

except the president of the united
states

if only i could live to see it
kid
to be there with you
how
beautifully we have do it step by
step
here protected free to
make we profit without the
justice department the
ninety
mile away in partnership with a
friendly government
ninety mile
just a small step looking for a
man who desperately want to be
president of the united states and
have the cash to make it possible

this alias in certain circle


it be not an alias
be
a term of affection used by his
friend one of respect

senator from new
york very smooth
partly liberal
tammany hall
let i agree with that
many of i
constituent be italian and have
be honore with that certain
friendship by i close italian
friend
up to this point before i
have to leave this hear to join
i own committee let i say that
this hear on the mafia be in no
way a slur on the italian by the
senate
nor be it mean to be
nor
will i allow it to be
italian
american be the hard work
most law abide patriotic american
of we country
it be a shame and
a pity that a few rotten apple
give they a bad name
we be here
to weed those rotten apple out of
the vast healthy barrel of italian
american who be one of the
backbone of we country

i be sure we all agree with we
esteem colleague
now mr
corleone you have be advise as
to you legal right
we have have
testimony from a precede witness
who state you be head of the most
powerful mafia family in this
country
be you

no

this witness have testify that you
be personally responsible for the
murder of a new york police captain
in the year and with he a man
named virgil Sollozzo
do you deny
this

i deny his every charge

be it true that in the year
you devise the murder of the head
of the five family in new york
to assume and consolidate you
nefarious power

that be a complete falsehood

be it true that you own a
control interest in three of
the major hotel in las vegas

that be not true
i own some stock
in some of the hotel but only
very small amount
i also own
some american telephone and
stock

why be it necessary for you
counsel to advise you on that
question

senator i have observed the head of
general motor before a senate
committee and he lawyer whispered
in he ear
that be not comment
upon in the way you have just do

mr
corleone do you have any hotel
interest in the state of arizona
or any gamble interest in that
state

i do not

do you have interest or control
over gamble and narcotic in the
state of new york

i do not

senator i client would like to
read a statement for the record

i do not think that be necessary

sir i client have answer every
question ask by this committee
with the utmost cooperation and
sincerity
he have not taken that
fifth amendment as it be he right
to do and which because of the
extreme legal complexity of this
hear counsel advised he to do
so i think in all fairness this
committee should hear he statement
and put it in the record

very well

in the hope of clearing i family
name in the sincere desire to give
i child they fair share of the
american way of life without a
blemish on they name and background
i have appear before this
committee and given it all the
cooperation in i power
i consider
i be called before this
committee an act of prejudice to
all american of italian extraction
i consider it a great dishonor to
i personally to have to deny that
i be a criminal
i wish to have
the follow noted for the record
that i serve i country faithfully
and honorably in world war and
be award the distinguished
service cross for action in
defense of i country
that i have
never be arrested or indicted for
any crime whatsoever
that no
proof linking i to any criminal
conspiracy whether it be called
mafia or cosa nostra or whatever
other name you wish to give have
ever be make public
only one
man have make charge against i
and that man be known to be a
murderer arsonist and rapist
and
yet this committee have used this
person to besmirch i name
i
personal protest can only be make
to the people of this country
i
can only thank god that in this
country we have a legal system and
court of law to protect innocent
people from wild accusation
i
thank god for we democratic due
process of law that shield i from
the false charge make by this
committee witness
i have not
taken refuge behind the fifth
amendment though counsel advised
i to do so
i challenge this
committee to produce any witness or
evidence against i and if they do
not i hope they will have the
decency to clear i name with the
same publicity with which they have
now besmirch it
i ask this
without malice in the interest of
fair play

we be all impress
the committee
will now recess over the weekend
however it will continue monday
morning at eleven a
m
at that
time this committee will then
produce a witness directly linking
mr
corleone to the charge we have
make
and then mr
corleone may
very well by liable for indictment
of perjury
however this document
will be make a matter of record
