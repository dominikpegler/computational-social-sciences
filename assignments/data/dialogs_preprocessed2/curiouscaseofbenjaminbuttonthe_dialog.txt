base on the short story by
scott fitzgerald

as all thing do it begin in the dark
blink
open

the first thing they see be a
near standing looking out a window watch the wind
blowing rattling a window



what be you looking at

the wind mother
they say a
hurricane be on it way
you have
be asleep
i be waiting to
see you


now we see we be in a hospital room with layer of white
enamel paint trying without success to hide the year
an old past wither still regal with a green
turban around she bald head be prop by pillow she
blue eye looking out at we from she bed
she be
connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
drip
she name be
she speak with a
southern lilt

if it be not for hurricane we
would not have a hurricane season

i have forgotten what the weather
can be like here
i have live with
four season so many year now
we see a young black woman a caregiver
in a corner thumb a magazine with one eye at the
window

i see on the news they be
predict trouble

they stacked people like
firewood to close a hole in a
levee
but daisy have other thing on she mind
murmuring




it all run together
like a
fingerpainting
i feel like i be
on a boat drifting

can i do anything for you mother
make anything easy

hmmm
there be nothing to do
caroline
this be what it be
i be finding it hard to keep i
eye open
i mouth all filled
with cotton
and agitated feel confined she scratch at she
nightgown as if it be sticking to she
she start to take
it off
dorothy get up and straighten it for she

there there miss daisy

prob today
caroline be well aware of it but the word she
admonition of death be so close at hand make
everything even more present

do you want more medication
mother
the doctor said you can
have all you want
daisy be quiet looking into the distance
caroline
seeking closure sit on the bed with she and start to
cry
daisy put she thin arm around she daughter
comforting she

friend told i she never have a
chance to say goodbye to she
mother
grateful to have the
chance
i wanted to thank you mother for
bringing i into this world
for
raising i so well




i wanted to tell you how much
you have mean to i

they hold each other for some time
they separate
and there be an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
about
nothing left to say to each other
a hole in
they relationship
caroline fill it with the eternal
question

be you afraid

curious
what come next
she wince at some physical pain

the pain coming more steadily
she breathe will falter soon
no need for she to suffer
she raise the morphine level
daisy close she eye
drifting with the morphine
and a thought a dream a
sound cross she mind
and she say

and we see a taxi door be open in slow motion
and daisy dressed for the night glide out
a man
helping she
and we see benjamin a step behind get
out of the car
dressed to the nines
hair slicked
elegant
but nonetheless a step behind
and we hear
Daisys voice from somewhere else



i dance for a man named
Ballenchine
he be a famous
choreographer
he said i have a
perfect line
they ask
Ballenchine to describe what he
do
he said i be a carpenter

be not that amazing
in one of his
rehearsal a dancer fell

it into the production
can you

ballet
dancer intentionally
falling

slow motion be showing she to a table
men and even
woman eye following she



they have torn up all the
convention
the straight up and
down style all the thing that
bound dancer
it be not about the
formality of the dance
the
classical structure
it be about
what the dancer feel
there
be no rule
the movement can be
tense or relax abrupt or
flowing carefree or somber it
may suggest love or hate
attraction or repulsion
the
unexpected shift of weight or
energy not just to shock but to
reinvent tradition
putting the
familiar form to new and
unexpected use
it be so basic
just you alone with you body
they reach a table
chair in slow motion swept out
for she to sit
another man in slow motion putting a
napkin in she lap


they understand americas vigor
and physicality they understand
the freshness of the american
people at they most modern at
they good



and she told i about this world
that she be so attracted to
name that do not mean a thing to
i
i do not really hear very
much of what she be saying
we watch they at the table
benjamin listen

she face aglow with the intensity and
the passion of youth

she come next to he and she
kiss he
and when he do not respond
she try a
different tact

in we group

people
not be afraid
sex

lot of
the dancer

woman wanted i to sleep with
she
he be quiet

man in he s now



i can not lie i do enjoy the
company of a woman or two



benjamin and a woman standing on the sidewalk outside a
restaurant in the middle of an ardent kiss
as a taxi
pull up


benjamin at the door kiss another woman
goodbye
going home



benjamins door open
another woman disheveled
coming out of he room



or maybe three
benjamin seeing she to the stairs
and as she start
down the stairs to leave
we see a cluster of old
people ready for the day looking up at they
the woman
making she way awkwardly down the stairs and out the
door
benjamin give a little self conscious wave to the
old timer and start back into he room
he slow at a
second story hallway window
looking outside at the
walkway
the familiar street beyond
if we do not know
any good he seem to be waiting for someone to come
home



and in the spring of


we see benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the
street on he way home
leaf the motorcycle out in
front


he come to the gate opening it coming into the yard
shut the gate behind he going up the walkway
an
old man be on the porch quietly rock
and queenie
for some reason be standing just outside the front door
on the porch
an apron in she hand
she nod to

talking to the old man in the rocking
chair
but she seem to be watch benjamin as he
walk around the house to the back door
he take off
he dirty work boot leaf they on the porch



he hop the back step and start to open the kitchen
door when it open
and now but still with
she unmistakable blue eye be standing before he



she come back
they look at each other in silence
and they simply
smile so glad to see each other after all the miss
year
they embrace
for some time
and kiss
as
people who have not see each other and have think
about each other
for a very long time
and it just
be
no big symphony no endless sky
just two
people at a kitchen door in the middle of they live
and the simplicity just that be what make it real and
break you heart


radio play
they sit at the kitchen table eat
dinner
the conversation mute
they do not know
really where to begin where do they leave oft
so they
do not begin until they can

do not you want to know where i have

and they sit quietly in the kitchen looking at each
other silently eating

symphony of night noise

goodnight

they look at each other
and they kiss

discover each other for the first time
while he
