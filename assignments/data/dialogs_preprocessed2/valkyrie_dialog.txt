i swear by god this sacred oath
that i shall render unconditional obedience to
adolf hitler the fuhrer of the german reich and
that i shall at all time be prepared as a brave
soldier to give i life for this oath

and from out of the blackness a voice
man speaking
in german faint at first crackling over the radio
subtitle translate the voice of adolf hitler



i comrade
once again i do not
know how many time it have be now
an attempt have be make on i
life
i speak to you tonight for
two reason
first so that you can
hear i voice and know that i be
unhurt
and second so that you may
know the detail of a crime without
parallel in german history





lonely airfield
and he stand
rigid by a gleam limousine

sequence proving how inaccessible he truly be


Tresckow and he aide step forward to greet hitler
but they be push back by guard

they waiting limo
to Tresckows surprise a second limousine roar onto
the airfield from out of nowhere

Tresckow and he aide share a glance and get in

beat later they be speeding after hitlers car


est

bustle
security be tight everyone be on edge


long table packed with strain they
neck to get a glimpse of they leader at the head
table but he be obscure by he detail of guard
dare to approach
the room fall silent
place a tray before the
fuhrer producing a knife and fork cutting a bite
we think he be going to hand feed hitler until he
place the food in he own mouth chewing slowly
deliberately
he swallow
we wait for he to die
when he do not hitler begin to eat
the rest of
the room relax slightly and dig in

seat **further/far down the table be Tresckow
and he aide
between they once again be brandt
eating like a pig still making note in he book
Tresckow stare


managing the Fuhrers security must
be quite an undertake

irregularity be the Fuhrers
precaution of choice

i can assure you he be safe here
relax brandt
enjoy you meal
Brandts look say do not be ridiculous
he clean
he plate in second
then he gently dab he mouth
take out he datebook and start writing once
again the precise man we see on the airfield

i understand you be returning to
berlin this afternoon
brandt nod

could i trouble you to deliver a
package to colonel Stieff
brandt nod again too busy write to notice the
knowing glance Tresckow share with he aide


tense silence
Tresckow and he aide be hunched over
two bottle of cointreau on a large desk next to
a small black plastic
case held together by magnet and adhesive tape
Tresckow insert a short pencilshaped fuse through
the narrow open
all that remains expose be a
small glass capsule

Tresckow turn his
attention to the bottle of cointreau


the condor engine roar ready for take off
soldier stand at attention as hitler board
brandt
be with he scribbling in he everpresent datebook

Tresckow and he aide approach
Tresckow gently
handle a carefully wrap package

Tresckow press a key against the side of
the package crushing the glass capsule inside
the
explosive arm now he hand it to brandt

with i regards to colonel Stieff
brandt accept the gift looking up from he book
he
study the familiar shape

cointreau
you well hope i do not
get thirsty on the flight
Tresckow politely smile hide he nerve have
just hand a bomb to hitlers head of security
brandt unknowingly carry it onto the plane with
hitler
the door to the condor be sealed behind he
along with we hope the Fuhrers fate
Tresckow look at he watch and we


clock show we that thirty minute have passed
Tresckow and he aide be seated on either side of a
desk stare at the telephone
smoke
wait



three hour later
the ashtray be overflow but
Tresckow and he aide have not moved
finally
the phone barely ring before Tresckow answer
he
do not say a word he only nod and hang up

he be
land
it take a moment for the gravity of this to set in

what about the
Tresckow be already dialing the telephone


get i colonel brandt
colonel
Tresckow
i trust you
landed safely
i hate to trouble
you but there be be a bit of a mix
up
it seem you have the wrong
bottle for colonel Stieff
you
do still have the package

i can be at you office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up
terribly sorry for the
inconvenience
thank you

do you think he know

there be only one way to be sure

i can only guess the altitude
cause the fuse to malfunction
first the beer hall memorial day
now this
someone be watch over
that sonofabitch i swear it

we have be discover
Tresckow halt and face Olbricht expressionless

what make you think

Osters be arrested
the gestapo
come for he last night
Tresckow think for a beat and resume walking
Olbricht hurry after he

do you hear what i said

the gestapo could have arrested he
for anything
find a replacement

there be no one we can trust
not in
berlin

then stop looking in berlin
just then they approach the final threshold a
guard an office marked

Olbricht stop regarding the door with dread
but
Tresckow press on reaching the door about to
enter when

you pistol please
oh shit
Tresckow play it cool remove he pistol
from it holster and hand it over
and with a nod to Olbricht Tresckow square his
shoulder and enter Brandts office




you will forgive i general
this
little roundup have have i writing
report all day

roundup

dissenter
plot against the
fuhrer

who would even have the ball

you would be surprised the number of
coward in this army that would be
will to stand against the reich

only if the fuhrer be dead of
course

of course
it be one thing to think
you know what be right
what matter
be have the strength to do it

be this what you have come for

perhaps we should open it


i beg you pardon

you have come a long way
you must be
thirsty

i wonder how the fuhrer who do
not partake would feel about an
officer who do so on duty
colonel brandt

i take you for another sort
general

and i you



jeep speed up to he from the distance driven by
a

colonel stauffenberg sir
new
headquarters have be established
at Mezzouna
i be to take you there
stauffenberg look over the scene expressionless

now they tell we to disengage a
day late
no matter how many time
we tell command the reality they
always manage to leave we
but he stop himself contain he rage

colonel the enemy be less than
five kilometer from here
you have
do all you can
stauffenberg glance at he right hand contemplate
a ring on he finger
after a beat

i wonder
be there even a point
in we come to tunis

to get taken prisoner it seem
stauffenberg smile bitterly and get in the jeep as

the first bomb explode before we even see the
tight formation of overhead
fighter plane strafe with machinegun
artillery
blast strike in front and behind the retreat
column
the th panzer division be trapped
panic hit the column like a tidal wave
stauffenberg
tap the young lieutenant who drive into the melee
soldier abandon they vehicle but cover be in short
supply and many be left in the open
so they run
dozens be gun down by the assail fighter
the
survivor watch in horror as the fighter slowly turn
to make another run
in a panic the soldier run the
other direction halt by a jeep block the way
stauffenberg stand in the passenger seat





i










mrs
stauffenberg

the colonel brother berthold

perhaps before you see the colonel
we should go to i office and

i will see i husband now



he be be constant with fever but
he refuse any pain killer
the
right hand have be amputate above
the wrist
he be lost the fourth and
fifth finger on the left
we
could not save the leave eye

he ring

i do not


he have a ring on he right hand
where be it

i be sorry
he hand be amputate
in the field
i be afraid

thank you

we have lost north africa



family photograph show the Stauffenbergs of
another generation wealthy aristocrat from a
bygone era
he be a teenager in this photo and
smile broadly
smile he left in africa
Stauffenbergs three finger push a cotton ball under
he eyepatch to dab the empty socket
then he go to
button he shirt
holding he collar in he tooth he
try to do the button with the use of only three
finger on he leave hand
it be heartbreaking to
watch
he be about to give up when he notice a figure
looming in the doorway
general Olbricht
he wince
at the sight of Stauffenbergs deformity

i do not know what i ever do with
ten
Olbricht manage a smile he move to speak but
stauffenberg beat he to it

i be wanted in berlin
Olbricht nod

be you asking as a member of the
high command
Olbricht contemplate he answer
he carefully close
the door behind he nervously glance at the
patient in the next bed

you can speak openly general
he
die just before you come in
awkward moment
finally

we could use you help

i be a field officer
Olbricht step closer speaking openly now

this war can not be win in the field


that be unfortunate for i

you can not honestly believe you will
make a difference on the front

i be a soldier general
i serve i
country

it make no sense
you oppose
hitler you oppose the war

the people choose otherwise and here
we be
now we have to win
you
know what will happen if we do not

if we win it will still be
hitlers germany

we all take an oath general
Olbricht nod resign
he realize it be no use
finally he produce a blue velvet box opening it to
reveal a brilliant gold medal

on behalf of the fuhrer
stauffenberg take the medal and study it

i be a twin you know
Olbricht be as confuse as we be

i
i do not

i brother die the day after we
be born

i be sorry
what the hell be he talking about


i be lying in the desert covered
in blood sure i be going to die
i tried to think about i wife i
child
but i mind keep
drifting to i dead brother
how i
would finally be with he
how i
would finally be whole again

this be i reward for what happen
to i man
it be all i deserve








colonel


i do not want the damn th

when will you be going back to the
front

i be not going to the front
i be
needed in berlin








he be not a man he be a lunatic
he do not drink he do not fuck
he have no weakness to exploit no
vice to manipulate
his only
passion be complete control
how
can you expect to reason with he

after this most recent failure i would
say we have no other choice

confront hitler now and you will end
up with piano wire for a necktie
we only option be the central
solution

he be a man like any other
flesh
and blood
take he head on and


i will say this for you doctor
you be certainly delusional enough
to take hitlers place

when that day come i will be sure
to remember you

i doubt you will remember much of
anything

dammit Tresckow
and the shout resume
it be beck who finally see
stauffenberg
he touch Tresckows arm
he in turn
nudge Olbricht and so on
moment later the room
be silent all eye on the colonel
everyone be a
little embarrass
Olbricht clear he throat

gentleman may i present colonel
stauffenberg
he be be reassign
to i office at the war ministry
colonel may i introduce

these man need no introduction
beck stand shaking Stauffenbergs hand

i apologize for this unfortunate
spectacle
on behalf of everyone
welc
but before he can finish beck be seize with a
gravelly cough that send an uncomfortable chill
through the room
he be very i will

i have not welcome he
not yet
where do he stand

for god sake


re
stauffenberg
he be a field officer
he know the
army good than any of we
i want
to hear he opinion

all right
what do you think
colonel
confront hitler force he
to resign
or the central solution
but before stauffenberg can answer

central solution
you soldier
be all the same
say what you
mean

that be a laugh coming from a
politician

the army will follow diplomat
before they follow assassin

they follow a butcher now
what
difference do it

what make you think the army will
follow you at all
the room quiets down
beck hide a slight smile
he
like stauffenberg already

oust he kill he
that be not what
matter
how do you plan to take
control of the government when
hitler be go
silence
then a wave of laughter
the ball on this
guy


i beg you pardon colonel but you
be in the presence of man who
would have be hitlers inner
circle
instead we resigned
we put
we principle above personal gain


we have the have the respect of the
people
and the army

with all respect sir you put too
much faith in you popularity
all of you do

now see here colonel

you said yourself i be a field
officer
you all may understand
government but i know the man

great many of they may hate hitler
but they all fear he they fear
himmler goebbels the whole of the
reich
that kind of fear will not just
die with hitler
and as for
respect
the army and the people
respect only one thing
authority
and if just one man question that
authority you can lose they all
they be fool into following
hitler
how will you fool they
force they into following you








what be you do here
i think
i left you in bamberg
it be a wonderful surprise
thank
you brother





etc









what do you mean you quit

i come to join the resistance not
some sew circle of discard
general and politician


beck be a just and capable man
as
for goerdeler well he be popular
he will make a good chancellor

like hitler before he yes
lately
i have to wonder if germany be even
fit to choose she own destiny

you can not blame the people for
this
you have to see the begin
of something to know how it will end
it be no different than a farmer
watch the corn grow
one day
it be over he head

plenty of people think

the great offender be not the
one who think good but the
one who sense well

what be you trying to say

i seem to remember you telling i
about report from the ukraine
the forcing jew to dig they
own grave
you said then that
hitler should be remove
an
officer duty you said
what be
changed

i said senior officer
the only
man that can get to he

perhaps it do not matter that you
succeed
stauffenberg look at berthold like he be crazy but

perhaps it only matter that you
try
do not you see
someone have to
stand up and show the world that
not all of we be like he


even if they could remove hitler
they can not hope to seize power
for
god sake they have no plan

then give they one
find a way

evil happen when good man do
nothing

child that be far too

Airraid








valkyrie



we have already considered valkyrie
it be not suitable

not as it be currently written

excuse i
what be valkyrie

operation valkyrie

the reserve army have thousands of
man all over the city most of
they not even in uniform
valkyrie
be top secret plan to mobilize
those man in a national emergency


hitler design it himself to crush
any internal unrest if he be cut off
or killed

and what use be that to we

the order could be rewrite

few subtle change would put those
reserve unit completely under we
command

yes of course but

now what would the high command do
if they think say the be
staging a coup

they would declare a military state
of emergency

and initiate operation valkyrie

hitlers own reserve army use
hitlers own plan and under we
command would automatically seize
power in berlin

while we put a new government in
place

precisely
it will seem as though
we be fighting for hitler
government not against it

but only if hitlers dead
all eye turn to goerdeler
here we go

that be what you be saying be not
it
the central solution


how else will you make people
believe the be trying to seize
power

i be afraid it be the only way

i be disappoint in you colonel
i
think a man of you background
would appreciate a more

i be a soldier first an aristocrat
second

yes but

and you be neither doctor
now if
you want to be chancellor you will
do as you be tell
moment of tension
humiliated goerdeler nod
but
he will not ever forget this

can this plan be make to work

rewrit the order be one thing
distributing it be another
bomb
can be disarm recovered if it
fail
in this case we would be
willfully circulating written
evidence of high treason
it be the good idea we have hear yet

there be one
small problem

fromm

who be fromm


commander of the home army
Olbricht can put the reserve troop
on alert but only fromm can
actually initiate valkyrie

can we get to he

he be a careerist pig

but one who be go as high as he
can go in hitlers army
it be no
secret he be not happy about it

perhaps if we offered he a key
position in the new regime he could
be make to see the light

we do not seem to have a choice
without fromm there be no valkyrie
get he




you be a woman fromm
and a fat
one at that
i would have you send to
the front if i do not think you would
surrender just to be Montgomerys
whore

the
general will see you now



what be it you want

well Olbricht
speak up

i wanted to introduce you to we
new man colonel stauffenberg

ah yes the hero from africa
i would
offer i hand but you might not
give it back

i would say the general lost more
important thing this morning

freeze
but after a tense beat fromm relax and
laugh taking a cigarette from a box on he desk and
nudge it toward they

about time they put a man with
ball in this office
have a seat
you too if you must
they sit
fromm light a cigarette lean back and
exhale a cloud of smoke
we let thing sit for
awhile
the game of recruitment be about to begin and
no one be sure where to start
the long the quiet
the more awkward thing seem
finally

they tell i you be critical of the
war colonel
not that you do not
seem to have good reason

i be critical of losing the war
general
all war as in africa
be lost through indecision

in the field you mean
he be bait stauffenberg to talk shit about hitler

in berlin

i take it that be why you be here
to make decision

i have make i decision general
im
here to help other make theirs
stauffenberg make no attempt to shade he delivery
he be quite clearly indicate that he mean more
fromm know it but he be be coy

they say when there be no clear
option one should do nothing

we be at war
we must act
sometimes
rashly


just what sort of rash action do
you have in mind colonel

that would be a decision for the
supreme military commander
fromm be get the message
he take a deep drag

supreme commander you say

second only to the chancellor

if only i be that man
this war
would be going quite differently

we be think the very same
thing
fromm frown at Olbricht
this be a bit too obvious
stauffenberg shoot Olbricht a look
what the hell
be you do

fromm casually stamp out he cigarette in the
ashtray and pick up the telephone
Olbricht and stauffenberg steel they nerve
certain they be going to be report
but fromm
do not dial
instead to we relief he disconnect
the line
when he be certain that it be dead

i do not need to remind you that
we have all sworn an oath
that said
i be going to forget we have this
conversation with the understand
that such speak will never occur
under this roof again
be i clear

yes sir

tell you friend that i always
come down on the right side
and as
long as the fuhrer be alive you
know what side that be


heil hitler



i think that go rather well

yes
quite









be you follow


dammit stauffenberg
you scare i
half to death

we will be close than that before
we be finished



look this over i be not
satisfy that the reserve army be
enough to shut down berlin
completely

yes i have be giving that some
thought
we should include any
field unit that be home on leave

i have also draw up an outline for
order to streamline combat group
in order to quietly concentrate
force at vital point state and
government building of course
but also the radio and newspaper


combat group will be reorganize
as reinforce grenadier regiment
one or two of they can be quickly
mobilize eliminate the usual
six hour lag
we blitz the
government quarter arrest all
minister and party leader
surround all and police
barracks
any officer who resist
will be arrested
or shot



if anyone come to you play
ignorant
just tell they

i will tell that i be serving the
german people
then i will tell they
to go to hell

to operation valkyrie


i have be transferred to the front

why do not you tell i

would you have stay
obviously not
then it occur to stauffenberg

do you think fromm reported we

it be more likely just
an
unfortunate coincidence
anyway it
do not matter
you write the
order
you know they good than
anyone

you do not mean to say

i be appoint you military leader
of the resistance
beck agree

but Olbricht

we both know Olbricht have not the
wit or the spine
no
it be you
million thought be running through Stauffenbergs
mind
fear
anxiety
but he know what he must do

one more thing
you be right what
you said that first night
it be not
enough to kill hitler
we need to
isolate he chain of command
the
slight confusion could crush we
we need to be certain that no
conflict order get out after
the flash
stauffenberg consider this for a moment


that greatly limit we option of
where and when to make we move
but it be the only way

how will you do it

perhaps it be good i do not say

god promised abraham that he would
not destroy sodom if he could find
just ten righteous man

i have a feel that for germany
it may come down to one






you realize how close i be to
hitler
with one word i could have
the gestapo make you disappear

why have not you then

none of i associate know we have
be talking if that be what you be
afraid of

but you know
and when the catch
you they will pull you apart like
warm bread
it will be a crime just
to have known you then
i warn you
if it mean protecting myself i
will expose you
do not try to
contact i again

you can not report i
maybe if you
have when i first approached you
you would have be keeping you oath
but now you be just as guilty as

so you think that make i a
sympathizer eh
you give a man the
choice of betray a fellow
officer or he fuhrer and assume
he action will show you he
heart
it be not that simple


it be to i

for the last time do not push i to
make a decision

i have no choice
it be clear now
that without you we have no hope of
success
pause
Fellgiebels silence speak volume

you want we to succeed
do not you

and what if you do eh
what then
will you be any different from
hitler
what of he reich he
people the very momentum of
history
will all of that let you
be something he be not

no

there it be

but i pregnant wife we four
child the germany i first swear
to defend
they demand that i be
something different
they demand
that i fight for they future even
if it mean
and for a moment he voice break and he choke back
what may be tear

even if it mean that i never see
they again
in that moment we see a side of stauffenberg we be
starting to doubt exist
we see he humanity
this
put Fellgiebel in he place
he adjust he tie and
we see the wedding ring on he finger


action be inevitable
as be the
consequence
when they come for i
i will do what i can to hide what you
know and when you know it
but do not delude yourself
you be
involved in a crime against you
country long before you meet i
there be still time to redeem
yourself
only god can judge you
now

be you two finish or just
get start



leave we please

you play the part of bureaucrat
beautifully

it be the only time i can relax


there be a man here to interview as
you adjutant

Adjut what for

no one told you
you have be promote chief of staff
for the reserve army
some man might find a promotion to be good news
not
stauffenberg

for christs sake
do not i have
enough to do

unfortunately you nocturnal
activity do not count as service
to the reich

i will refuse the promotion

you will do no such thing

dammit i can not handle the work i
already

this be an opportunity we could
never have dream of
you be in
the inner circle now with genuine
access to hitler he advisor he
schedule
we need this

we be not ready
we be moving too
fast

not half as fast as the ally
an
invasion be coming colonel
any
day now
we must act and we must
act soon


Tresckow may have left you in
charge of the central solution
but in this world i still outrank
you
you will accept the
appointment
be that understood
stauffenberg nod grudgingly

now
the new man be waiting
outside
he come highly
recommended
he might even be an
ideal candidate

for what

we still need an assassin
Olbricht leave
stauffenberg let we this sink in
he
take a seat and go back to work
after a moment
quietly enter



haeften click he heel and offer the nazi salute
but before he can say the word

be seated
throw haeften sit
stauffenberg continue write
ignore he
haeften look up at the portrait of
hitler startle when stauffenberg finally speak

do you know how this war will end
haeften
the portrait will be un
hung
and the man will be hung
stauffenberg look up looking for a reaction to
such frank and treasonous talk
he get none
he
sigh too tire to play game

bottom line
i be engaged in high
treason with all means available to
i
can i count you in


for anything sir
anything at all

anything be a very dangerous word





the ally force have blunder
into the trap awaiting they on the
beach of normandy heroically
repel by the combine might of
the german army
it be a glorious
day for the reich
at long last the
craven enemy have come to europe to
face they inevitable defeat at the
hand of



five thousand ship onehundred
thousand man from the combine
ally force

what about the panzer division in

they be never dispatch
word be
hitler take a sleep pill
he
staff be afraid to wake he


first africa now france

the russian bearing down from the
east

sometimes i wonder if hitlers real
aim be to leave nothing but
scorched earth for all of europe

maybe this be a bless in
disguise
maybe he will finally
listen to reason consider a truce
while he still can

we will see if i can not convince he






you do not need to search he

colonel stauffenberg be an honore
guest
the hero of africa

for god sake stauffenberg
you be

they be waiting for you



we have arrive in the sanctum sanatorium of nazi
germany on the day after the normandy invasion
but
you would never know the tide of the war have just
turn against germany
series of situation map
be scatter before they ignore
only speer seem to be reserved smile politely but
clearly tune into the present reality
look
closer at goering we see he be wearing heavy makeup
add to the already surreal nature of the scene
it be also the first time we be allow a clear
unobstructed view of hitler

Mein fuhrer
i wish to present
colonel claus von stauffenberg
we new chief of general staff for
the replacement army
the laughter stop
hitler and he crony turn
toward stauffenberg looking he over
hitler stand
and cross to he
fromm meet he first whisper
in the Fuhrers ear perhaps remind he who
stauffenberg be
hitler nod
ah yes
he take
Stauffenbergs left hand with both of his
we be
surprise by he charm

may i say i be honore to meet a
hero who have sacrifice so much for
germany
if only more of i
officer be like you
hitlers crony smile despite the subtle insult to
themselves
to make it bad hitler turn to they

let this man stand as an example to
all of you
he be the ideal german
officer
fromm nervously clear he throat

Mein fuhrer we have ask
stauffenberg here today so that he
might brief we on mobilize troop
from the home army to support those
in normandy


hmmm
oh yes normandy
that will
no longer be necessary
general
goering have assure i that
normandy be under control

Mein fuhrer if i may
the
situation in normandy be

you be dismiss stauffenberg

but

send you man home fromm
then
bring we some brandy

heil hitler



i do not know what you have get
brew and i do not want to know
but when the music stop i would be
much oblige if keitel should find
himself without a chair




they be all insane
every one of
they except for speer and he be
nothing but an architect

tell beck we have find we
assassin
i will do it myself



out of the question
it will not work
we need you here in berlin

who else then
who can even get as
close

valkyrie be very clear
once the
order be given the reserve army
will automatically seize control of
the government with or without i


order be not enough
they need a
man to follow
the right man

Olbricht will oversee operation in
i absence
i can be back in berlin
three hour after hitler be

three very crucial hour

we both know there be no other way

i will tell the other

i be afraid whatever the outcome i
will not be there to see it

nonsense
you be strong than you
think
you might just be the
strong one of all





nina sit across from he halfreading a book half
talking to she husband
stauffenberg cannot hear a
word she be saying he be mile away
he look over at he child
one would never
suspect that germany have wage a calamitous war and
that the country be facing total devastation

after that i think i would take
the child to the country for a
few day to see i claus
he snap out of he thought
hmmm


have you hear a word i said

the country
nina
listen
i want you to delay
you trip
just for a while
she want to ask he want to tell she
finally

do this have something to do
with
you work

i would just be more comfortable
knowing where you be until i be
back from berlin
thing will be
different then
i promise
long pause
once again a couple who know each other
well enough to not have to say thing plainly
nina
be worry but strong

how long until
until we see you

few day
if all go well
then
we can travel as a family

and if thing
do not go well
he hesitate


i love you nina

and i love you
what


etc


go be with you child



two gram pack of plasticW
enough explosive to cripple a
panzer
you detonator
you fuse
british time pencil
this acid capsule be you trigger


when you be ready to arm attach
the detonator to the bottom of the
time pencil like so
insert the entire device into
either end of the plasticW crush
the acid capsule and you be live
when the acid eat through the wire
holding back the trigger spring
well
you will want to be very far
away

what if they search you bag

i be one of the inner circle now
they will make sure i be who i be
beyond that they will not touch i
how much time do i have

theoretically there be a minute
delay
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the wolf lair
i would give you minute top

that be
hardly precise

this be state of the art
you can
have small or precise
not both

might this be just a little too
small

the explosion will not do the kill
the air in the room will
he point to the draw an overhead sketch of

hitlers bunker be constructed of
reenforced concrete
steel door
no window
just one of these
explosive in a space like that
will because tremendous air pressure


enough to instantly kill everyone
present
the second charge will be
entirely redundant

of course i be all for redundancy
however
if by some miracle
hitler do survive what then

we have an inside man at the wolf
lair in communication
he will
notify you immediately follow
the flash and then sever all
contact with the outside world
the other be stun

just how do you manage that

it be i job be not it
while
hitlers inner circle be still
regroup you will initiate
valkyrie and seize control in paris
and berlin
even if hitler
survive we will have momentum

but as you said yourself it would
take a miracle
anyone in that
bunker when just one of these go
off be not coming out alive
haeften place the item back in the briefcase

himmler be expected to be at the
meet as well
do not proceed
unless you can get they both

that could be difficult

why kill a madman just to have a
lunatic take he place

this be Goerdelers idea be not it


the member be in total agreement
on this

fucking politician
i will hold off
if the decision be unanimous
and i
want another man on the committee
soldier

and just who this soldier be

he

he

this be general Olbricht
order the
guard batallion and all army
school near berlin to take up
march readiness

operation valkyrie

army for some sort of standby

i have never hear of that

send the order through sergeant




what do you suppose this be all
about

probably just a drill









drive on

himmler
where be himmler

business

i briefcase

gentleman

that call well have be
important

you bag
colonel



what the hell be going on
i man
have be standing here for an
hour
i do not know what to tell
they


at ease gentleman
Olbricht address the man trying unsuccessfully to
hide he nerve

this have be a drill
you be all
to be commended for you quick
response
dismiss
pause
the man linger confuse until




and the man fall out nowhere to go so they just
light up and shoot the shit
hagen approach Remer

what do i tell you
drill
but Remer be not so sure
the way he stare at
Olbricht make we nervous

Olbricht see Remer looking at he making
note of the esteem pinned to Remers
uniform
Olbricht lean toward hase

that man there
who be he

major Remer
he command the
deutschland guard batallion
what
about he

Remer

an order taker
to the bone
ah yes
but whose order

how dare you put the reserve army
on standby without i knowledge
you damn near cost i i
commission

do i make myself abundantly clear

yes sir


heil hitler

heil hitler

i will hear you say it colonel





the point of you central solution
be to replace hitler so that we can
negotiate a truce with the ally
the ally i suspect would be
more amenable to a truce




today be a matter of indecision
nothing more
military operation
in the hand of a politician

i do not think i be alone when i say
you judgement be in question
i would like to take a vote

beck turn to the bar pour two drink
stauffenberg
stiffen ready for the axe

i consider you a friend
and i look

to speak for he
finally almost in tear


ludwig i
beck offer he an envelope

disappear carl
avoid contact with

ugly pause
goerdeler snatch the envelope and sulk
out
we could not be happy to see he go

table surround by
one by one
they present they individual briefing to the
nodding fuhrer
stauffenberg whisper to Freyend

i injury left i a bit hard of
hear

Freyend nod but for now he concern be elsewhere

belt and hat on hook at the entrance to the brief
room
he catch sight of the
conference hut young telephone operator

sergeant
i be expect an urgent
call from berlin


small room measuring by foot
stifle heat
we notice again that the window be open to let in
some air
hitler and he officer hunch over a long
heavy table covered in detail map of eastern
europe and the soviet union
and continually tiptoe in and
out of the room
stand beside hitler in
the middle of he brief

the eastern front force be
assure a victory
but they need
reinforcement
in other word they be get pound but he can not
say that
the general be relive to be interrupt by
Keitels arrival
the brief stop momentary as

please pardon we tardiness
you
remember colonel stauffenberg

hitler make a deliberate effort to shake
Stauffenbergs hand they eye lock an unnerve
moment
stauffenberg have come to kill this man
greeting he
the moment be broken when the general
clear he throat continuing he presentation

as you can see Mein fuhrer the
situation in the east prussian
sector be increasingly critical
and on and on

Freyend startle stauffenberg slightly when he take
he by the arm moving he to he place at the table
less than half a step from hitler
he be squeezed in
between two other officer
we suck in wind when we
see who one of they be
the same brandt who carry
the bottle of cointreau onto hitlers plane so long
ago
he still scribble in he damn datebook
Freyend set the briefcase beside stauffenberg
bumping Brandts leg
brandt look down at the
briefcase long enough to make we nervous
he watch as stauffenberg nonchalantly bend down
sliding the briefcase as close to hitler as possible
leaning it against the heavy wooden table support
immediately to the right of hitlers foot
stauffenberg look back at the open door glance at
he watch
he can clearly see sergeant adam the
telephone operator
where be he goddamn phone call
around he general talk hitler nod but we hear
nothing
only the pulse of Stauffenbergs heartbeat
in he own ear the only thing betray he
otherwise outward calm
he look down at the briefcase the bomb just under
he foot
he look at hitler nodding
the long we
stay the more excruciating it be
so we milk it
stauffenberg be startle when a hand touch he arm
the annoy Freyend be there whispering in he ear
keitel see this irritated by the interruption

plane
beat later it be rolling down the runway

by the way where be you man
colonel stauffenberg

click
after a beat fromm hang up smug

Herbers outward relief stand in sharp contrast to
Olbrichts barely contained dread
then

all eye turn to see stauffenberg and haeften appear
in the doorway
mertz let we out a sigh of relief as
they push they way past Herber and march into the

stauffenberg mertz and Olbricht march with great
purpose
they be joined by beck coming the other
way wearing a plain dark suit
it be moving to see
the old man manage the long walk

you be not in uniform

of the people
then he take Stauffenbergs arm letting mertz and
Olbricht walk on lowering he voice


you be certain he be dead

stauffenberg can see the private fear in
beck eye
but before he can answer he be
interrupt by a gasp

as Olbricht open the door
to he office step back in shock
the other
turn to see what it be


look out at the shock face of Olbricht mertz
beck and stauffenberg

Olbrichts office be packed to the four wall with
all of they standing in silence
looking at the leader of the resistance with great
respect
stauffenberg walk in and the crowd part

like the lieutenant who drive stauffenberg in africa

blow to the resistance
those anonymous soldier
present exchange glance of concern

i be sorry colonel
after a beat Olbricht turn and leaf
tuck away in a corner
of the office

he look at stauffenberg in a new light now
something dark no longer the admirer
he share a
look with
wordless
understand
he leaf and they follow


Herber and company march down the hallway in silence
they stop for Herber to unlock the door to


the officer file in making a beeline for a locker
in the corner of the room
inside be all manner of
submachine gun pistol grenade

arm yourselves


under Remers direction the deutschland guard
batallion quickly surround the war ministry
we see a figure moving behind the window up above


Olbricht helplessly watch troop surround the
building below
it be only a matter of time now
he sit at he desk
with a long trembling sigh he
put pen to paper and write
i dear wife

commotion from the anteroom startle Olbricht and
he drop the pen
loud shrill scream follow
the door burst open to reveal Herber and he

they be supported by
all train they weapon on Olbricht
in the anteroom behind the soldier we see fraulein
oven quietly slipping out into the hallway



beck stauffenberg and haeften be still making call
and write order do all they can to keep the
coup alive
they be startle when fraulein oven
burst in
it be written on she face


stauffenberg and haeften rush toward Olbrichts
office stopping when they see a
surrounding the doorway
chill run down we spine
when we see Herber talking to none other than major
Remer
just then he spot stauffenberg and haeften


stauffenberg and haeften turn and run



shot be fired
stauffenberg and haeften take
cover in a nearby doorway
haeften return fire
stauffenberg clamp he pistol under the stump of he
right arm managing to cock it with the three finger
of he leave hand
awkward
then he aim and fire
stauffenberg take a bullet in the shoulder of he
good arm
he drop he gun bleeding badly
but appear at the opposite end of the
corridor
the loyal haeften cover stauffenberg with
he body aim to fire
but stauffenberg stop he
shaking he head
it be over
they toss down they
gun
Bootsteps approach loudly

as stauffenberg look down at the cross and ring
around he neck

for what

the other bravely nod in agreement
but then

stauffenberg look at beck with surprise

for personal reason
fromm think about it then matteroffactly hand
beck a pistol
Remer quickly step forward

general i order be to deliver
the prisoner alive

note major

but sir



fromm glare at Remer who angrily back down
then he
turn to beck and with a casual wave of the hand

continue
the moment be surreal
beck seated at the desk
look at each of he fellow conspirator
look of
thank goodbye
with a badly trembling hand he
place the gun to he temple

i be think of early time

the conspirator turn away unable to
watch
except stauffenberg

and as if none of the last minute have even occur
fromm turn to the other conspirator

very well then
court martial
convene by i in the Fuhrers
absence have pronounced sentence
colonel mertz von Quernheim
general Olbricht lieutenant
haeften
and the colonel whose name i will
not mention be condemned to
death
take they outside
Remer be clearly upset by this
Herber on the other
hand seem clear than ever
he nod to he man who
drag the conspirator out
Herber personally take
stauffenberg by the arm
the two man share a look
nothing need to be say
each have find he place
stauffenberg turn to confront fromm
he be weak
white from fatigue and loss of blood

the fuhrer will want to put we on
trial make an example of we
this
will not win you any favor
and it
will not hide you be involvement

involvement
i do not know what you


you know and you do nothing
you be just as guilty as we be
even more so

spare i stauffenberg
and those word bring a genuine smile to
Stauffenbergs face
he almost pity fromm now

no one will be spare
and as fromm motion for Herber to take stauffenberg
away we hear music faintly at first accompany
by the subtle hiss and crackle of a phonograph
it
be the piece stauffenberg and nina be dancing to
one night long ago
over this
voice
man speaking in german faint at first
crackling over the radio



i comrade
once again i do not
know how many time it have be now
an attempt have be make on i
life



series of image of the coup be reversed as the
nazi take back power make all the more poignant by
the lonely sound of the phonograph the music slowly
rising growing clear and eventually becoming score
over the silent image of
conspirator be rounded up and arrested
among
they be face we recognize
goerdeler drag from a hotel bed by as
he inform watch from the doorway





Witzleben be lead in handcuff from he home where he
have be awaiting he fate






military vehicle be hastily arranged in a semi
circle headlamp marking the scene in stark white
light and long black shadow
stauffenberg haeften Olbricht and mertz be march
into the courtyard squint in the harsh light as
they be place against the wall of the war ministry



i speak to you tonight for two
reason
first so that you can
hear i voice and know that i be
unhurt
and second so that you may
know the detail of a crime without
parallel in german history



Fellgiebel be swarm by in he office at the
wolf lair and summarily beaten




chief of police Helldorf be catch by surprise as his
own man burst into he office rifle raised






of the deutschland guard batallion
scramble to form a line opposite stauffenberg and he
conspirator
we can clearly read Fromms lip
shouting


stauffenberg and haeften share a reassure smile
Remer watch bitterly from the shadow focus he
hatred not on the conspirator
but on fromm



berthold Stauffenbergs brother be taken from his
flat in berlin







fromm smile to himself satisfy



small clique of ambitious
dishonorable stupid officer have
conspire to eliminate i
except
for a few bruise and burn i be
completely untouched
fromm raise he arm he lip reading






stauffenberg take a breath and shout defiantly he
lip read
long live sacred german
fromm drop he hand
ten rifle open fire
and away as the music swell as what be
left of berlin come into view as the few light
that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow be
passing over the land



i see in this the hand of
providence
directing i to
complete i work
and the last strain of music resolve in a single
sustain note as we looking at
last to the overcast darkness of the night sky
the
last note go on as if it might play forever
until suddenly it dip and we realize we be no
longer hearing music at all but the urgent wailing
of an airraid siren the warn of ally bomber
coming to deliver they nightly assault on berlin
hitlers gift to germany
