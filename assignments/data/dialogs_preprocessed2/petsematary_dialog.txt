boneyard but a bone be not nothing
and even a whole pile of they do not
amount to much
do you know what a
graveyard really be

well

it be a place where the dead speak
missy

Nonot right out loud
they stone
speak
or they marker
even if the
marker be not nothing but a tin can
someone write on with a magic marker
it speak

what if you can not read what be
written on there anymore

laid down here after do not it

yes

and that someone care enough about
that animal to mark the spot

precautionsbut i be sure church
will be all right honey

be all right in the end no matter how
you fix i be

in the end he be going to croak be not he

lovey
church might be still alive when
you be in a high school
and that be a
very long time

it do not seem long to i
it seem
short
i think the whole thing about
pet dying sssucks

if it be up to i i would let church live
to be a hundred
but i do not make up
the rule
