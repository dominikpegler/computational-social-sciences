wisconsin on the th of may
and on the th
of may he speak he first word and unlike other
child who say commonplace thing like momma and
poppa he proclaim i be a genius


so how could the magic of the stage not call to
this adventurous lad
unstoppable and resolute the
boy wonder journeyed into the world of the legit
theater
after a peripatetic begin he find
himself at last in new york where he joined force
with theatrical producer john houseman under the
august auspices of the federal theater

orson barreled in and take over
Orsons a real
barreler

like hannibal over the alps the boy genius invaded
the great white way
he stunned the sedate elite of
new york theatre with production after production
from with an entirely colored cast to a
Mussoliniinspired

though he wow the critic with he spectacular
the ticket sales left something to be desire
so
after found the mercury player with houseman
young mr
welles quickly set he sight on the
airwave
he quickly become the sonorous voice of
the shadow


who know what evil lurk in the heart of man
the
shadow know



with lament cranston in one pocket and he own
radio show
the mercury theater of the air we boy
wonder filled the night with he resound tone
and on october th of he become what he feel
destine to be
a household name

into a frenzy
nine million listener clasp they
love one close and look to the sky with
horror

invasion rural new jersey run screaming into
the night sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death
await they around every corner

with budget up to a picture
he would have
total control over the shoot of the picture and
the finish product

paid the bill
meanwhile the insider of filmland
be skeptical

john ford do not have a deal like that
cecil

deal like that
if you ask i george schaefer be
just plain nut
