
written by
larry and andy Wachowski
base on the graphic novel by alan moore



remember remember the fifth of
november the gunpowder treason and
plot
i know of now reason why the
gunpowder treason should ever be
forget




those be almost the very first
word he speak to i and in a way
that be where this story begin
four hundred year ago in a cellar
beneath the house of parliament



in guy fawkes attempted to
blow up the house of parliament



he be catch in the cellar with
enough gunpowder to level most of
london



sometimes i wonder where we would
be if he have not failed
i wonder
if it would have matter



i suppose the answer be in the
rhyme
more than the man what we
must remember be the plot itself



for in the plot we find more than
just a man we find the idea of
that man the spirit of that man
and that be what we must never
forget



this then be the story of that
idea of that spirit that begin
with an anarchist plot four
hundred year ago




i be born near the end of the
millennium the year
i
father used to say that people be
so afraid that the world be going
to end that they be willing it to
happen



i do not remember much of the
century turn
i do not remember
the market crash or the plague or
any of the trafalgar riot



i have read about they since but i
do not recall how any of they
impacted i life except for the
fear
they would hide it from i
like a secret between they



but i could feel it



of the chaos that seem to swallow
the begin of the st century
there be one thing i do remember



very clearly i can remember that
sound



and i remember those boot black
leather that gleam bright in the
morning sun
i have never see such
boot
all moving in perfect
unison

the time have come london to
return to a bygone age an age of
tradition an age of value that
have be disparage and all but
forgotten
what this country need
be a leader
true leader to
remind we of that age
righteous
leader with the strength of he
moral conviction to do what must
be do
i give you that man
i
give you we leader
adam susan



it must have seem so easy to
they
they offered such a simple
deal
give up control and we will
restore order



at first the arrest be
political
dissident
radical
liberal



when i parent be young they
have be activist
they have
march with labor in the great
train strike

overnight
i life i entire world be

it be do so quickly and
violently so completely that it
begin to seem that it have never
even exist



the homosexual be next
what
god have start with have to be
finished by man
it be god
work
that be what we be tell



but once they be go there be
someone else
someone different



someone dangerous



there be those who understood
what be happening who know it be
wrong but who keep silent



and in the vacuum of that silence
order be imposed



order that be like those boot
order that required rigorous
discipline
order that be exactly
the same where each single step
fall with every step
the order
of the many shaped into one



somehow in i heart i know it
would not last



what they think they have crushed
the spirit they believe trampled
and ground beneath the marching of
they boot rose up rose as if
from a four hundred year old grave
rose to remind we all that day

may rd



prothero have hand pick i
subject
four dozen of they none
of which will be any use to i if i
do not get to work soon



they be so weak and pathetic i find
myself hate they



they do not fight or struggle
just
stare at you with weak eye

next



june th
of the original four
dozen over be now deceased
strangely no clear pattern have
emerge as of yet



batch seem to have no common
discernible effect on any specific
group though the man seem slightly
more resilient than the woman



i be hope the survivor will
provide more answer or i time
here will have go to waste



june
and only five left now
two man and three woman
which
tend to contradict i entry on the
th



the man in room five be a
fascinating case



physically there do not seem to
be anything wrong with he
no
cellular anomaly nothing



batch five however seem to have
bring on some kind of psychotic
breakdown
he be quite insane



he have this way of looking through
you
reverend Lilliman will not go
near he
he claim that it be the
devil in room five
i see he
cross himself whenever he pass
he door
still there be something
about he



i be glad prothero let room five
have a go at the garden project
he be quite proficient
prothero
be reluctant to allow an inmate
access to the tool and chemical
supply at first but now the fat
toad be delight
the crop have
almost double



he also grow rose
beautiful
rose



december th
i be in the mess
it be about half past ten when we
hear the first explosion



the one at the front run straight
into the gas
it be horrible



few of we make it out through the
rear door
you could hear man
screaming everywhere
i hate the
sound of man screaming



in the center of the camp
everything be on fire
everyone
running in all direction
we have
hardly enough time to get we
bearing when the oven exploded



it be the man in room rive
i
could not have known
the chemical
supply grease solvent ammonia
fertilizer
he would be making
thing with they



mustard gas

and napalm



and in the yard i see he
he have
the flame behind he
he be
naked



he look at i



as if i be an insect
oh god
as if i be something mounted on a
slide



he look at i

that be the last entry until six
month later when dr
surridge be
back in london
there be no
mention of the man in room five
again
end of story

except that it be not the end of
the story

between and over forty
man and woman who be previously
station at larkhill meet with what
be believe to be accidental
death
eventually only three
remain

the three he would be saving until
last

everyone who worked at larkhill
everyone who could have identified
he
you see there be two
possible motive here
not one

the first be revenge
he escape
from larkhill and vow to get even
with he tormentor
the whole
exercise an elaborate chilling
vendetta

that be the explanation that i find
most reassure funnily enough
because that mean he be finished
it be over now

the second motive be more sinister
like i said everyone who could
have identified he be dead

what if he be just be clearing the
ground

what if he be planning something
else

you see the diary we find be in
full view
we do not have to
search for it
he left it there
he wanted we to find it
he wanted
we to know the story
or

for all we know the diary could be
a complete and utter fake
codename could have written it
himself

he be playing game with we
he
might never have be at larkhill
at all
do you see
it could all
be another smoke screen a false
trail another cover story

enough

because i be under the impression
that you have some information about
the terrorist codename

hundreds of soldier rush here

want we to talk

hush
turn it up

they be afraid that i be going to
say the thing that be not
suppose to be say
they be
afraid that i be going to say the
truth

the truth be that there be
something terribly wrong with this
country be not there
if you look
about you witness cruelty
injustice and despotism
but what
do you do about it
what can you
do



you be but a single individual
how can you possible make any
difference
individual have no
power in this modern world
that be what you have be taught
because that be what they need you
to believe
but it be not true

this be why they be afraid and the
reason that i be here
to remind
you that it be individual who
always hold the power
the real
power
individual like i
and
individual like you

i have come to offer you a deal
if you accept i will give you a
different world
world without
curfew without soldier and
surveillance system
world that
be not run by other man but that be
run by you
i be offering you a
second chance

four hundred year ago a great
citizen make a most significant
contribution to we common culture
it be a contribution forged in
secrecy and stealth although it be
best remember in noise and bright
light

to commemorate that glorious night
at precisely the stroke of
midnight the edifice of they
world will erupt with enough sound
and fury to shake the earth
all i
ask be that you join i at the
gate to watch as the past be
erase the pathway clear so that
together we can start toward a new
day

i want this man dead
i want he
shoot on sight

yes sir



but you ask who be i to make such
promise
fair question but
hardly necessary as you know i
already
to know i any more you
need only look to a mirror

truth be tell this be not even i
idea be it
if you think back
you will remember that night
whispering in you lover arm
i
become a part of you plan just as
you have now become part of mine
give i the line of the queen and
i will give you you secret dream



on the twelfth stroke of the fifth
day of the eleventh month i hope
we shall all meet again

until then i bid you goodnight

who be it
who be he

roger Dascombe
of course
of
course
it make such perfect
sense

sir i think there have be a
mistake

no
there be no mistake

but sir there be people that say
they see both the terrorist and
Dascombe together

who
who be these people
they
must be detain immediately
whatever they see or whatever they
think they see be subordinate to
the truth and that truth be that
roger Dascombe be the terrorist and
the terrorist be dead

but i think i be the terrorist

finch what be you do here

since i be not in jail and since you
have another even more convenient
suspect
i be guessing the charge
have be drop

be careful finch

i be careful sir
always
that
be why i suggest that a search of
this build begin immediately

the terrorist be dead

with all due respect i disagree
and i believe that he be presently
trying to get out of this build
disguised as one of we

be you challenging i authority

no sir i be trying to run an
investigation

i be trying to run a country
when
i tell you mr
finch the
terrorist be dead then the
terrorist be dead
if you continue
to suggest otherwise then you will
leave i no choice but to have you
arrested on charge of sedition
do i make myself clear

now it be imperative for the
people of london to know that they
be safe that the terrorist be
dead and everything be under
control

the terrorist be dead
no **further/far
threat exist
everything be under
control

bollock

bollock

he be not dead
it be all bollock

if you give i the line of the
queen i will give you you secret
dream

play it again

i be just a
dumb old dog
dumb old dog that
only know one trick

that be not it finch
it be more
than that
i know you
it be
something personal with this one

maybe
and maybe i be not ready for
a revolution

well we get less than thirty hour
to stop it

how

it be on the tape
i know it
i
can feel it
he do this for a
reason
he need something

or a book

it
