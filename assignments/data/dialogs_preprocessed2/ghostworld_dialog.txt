and


high school be like the train
wheel for the bicycle of real life
it be a time for young people to
explore different field of interest
and to hopefully grow from they
experience
after all that which
we learn from we mistake can be as
valuable as what we learn from we
textbook and often we can turn the
negative experience that be common
to all highschoolers into positive
step toward personal growth and
achievement
in coming to term with
i own personal setback which i be
sure you have all hear about i have
be able to learn a lot about myself
i have learned for one thing that i
do not need to rely on drug and
alcohol
and that i be very luckythat more
people besides carrie and myself
be not hurt in the accident
i have
learned that i be blessed with
wonderful parent teacher and above
all the good classmate in the world

with issue
emotional spiritual
political
of great importance

need to be nag and bitch at
constantly

you hang out with i because nobody
else can stand to be around you

maybe that be why we spend so much
time together

you be gross
see that guy

you be just jealous

yeah right
believe i at this
point i be over the fact that every
single guy like you good than i

face it you hate every single boy
on the face of the earth

that be not true i just hate all
these obnoxious extroverted pseudo
bohemian loser
sometimes i think i act so weird
because i be crazy from sexual
frustration

have not you hear about the miracle
of masturbation

maybe we should be lesbo

get away from i


who be this enid

it be suppose to be don knotts

and what be you reason for choosing
he as you subject

i dunno
i just like don knotts

i see
interesting

what do we have here margaret

it be a tampon in a teacup

i can see that
now what can you
tell we about it
first of all what
kind of sculpture be this

it be a find object
that be when
an artist take an ordinary object
and place it in an artistic context
and thus it become art

very good
now what can you tell we
about it in regard to you artistic
intent

i guess i see the teacup as a symbol
for womanhood because of tea party
in the olden day but instead of
tea i be trying to kind of confront
people with this
like

this shock image of repress
femininity

right exactly

i think it be really a wonderful piece
margaret

this illustrate perfectly what i
be saying about not be afraid to
use controversial imagery class

comino atchya on this beautiful
evening

god that asshole voice be so
hateful
no wonder i never listen to
the radio

no

just wait here

hi

hello
uh
that be great music
huh

yeah i just love blue

actually technically what he be
mostly playing would more accurately
be classified in the ragtime idiom
although of course not in the
strict sense of the more classical
ragtime piano music like that of
scott joplin or joseph lamb
authentic
blue have a more conventional twelve
bar structure in it stanza

oh if you like authentic blue you have
just get to see Blueshammer
they be
so great

all right people
be you ready to

cuz we gwine play you some

signing that band to you label

jesus

now i remember why i have not go
anywhere in month
i be not even in
the same universe as those creature
back there
i might as well be from
another planet

we just need to figure out a place
where you can meet somebody who be not
a total idiot that be all

look i really appreciate you help
enid but let we face it this be
hopeless

it be not hopeless

yeah well it be simple for everybody
else give they a big mac and a pair
of nike and they be happy
i just
can not relate to
of humanity

yeah well i can not relate to humanity
either but i do not think it be totally
hopeless

but it be not totally hopeless for
you
i have have it
i do not even
have the energy to try anymore
you
should make sure you do the exact
opposite of everything i do so you
do not end up like i

i would rather end up like you than those
people at that stupid bar
at
least you be an interesting person
at least you be not exactly like
everybody else

hooray for i

i be not sure i have anything to
drink
there might be some

it do not matter i be not staying
long
i just want to make sure i
convince you not to give up yet

yet


pick up an antique
knick knack
wow this be so cool

if you do not mind i asking why
do you care so much if i get a date
or not

i dunno
because i can not stand the
idea of a world where a guy like you
can not get a date

what the fuck seymour
what be
this

what
oh that
i borrowed that
from work about fifteen year ago
i guess it be mine now

what be you a klansman or something

yeah right i be a klansman thank
a lot
do you know the cook
chicken franchise

quoting commercial
in deep voice
fourpiece cook special deep fry
with side n slaw it be

yeah well cook be just a make
up name
when they originally opened
back in they be named the
coon chicken inn that be an early
paint of they first logo

i be obsess with all this stuff
this lose culture of the th century

why do not everybody know this

it be ancient history
the same reason
nobody know about this lionel Belasco
record

actually i be a whole lot more
interest in the cook phenomenon
when i be about you age
i have kind
of lose interest since i have be
working for they

you work at cook chicken

for nineteen year

what be you a fry cook or something

nothing so glamorous
actually
i be an assistant manager at they
corporate headquarters

jesus i would go nut if i have to work
in an office all day

hey i get good benefit a good
early retirement plan nobody ever
bother i

yeah but still

i make enough money to eat and buy
old record
what more do i want

so i do not really get it be you
saying that thing be well back
then
even though there be stuff like
this

no in a lot of way thing be good
now
i dunno
it be complicate
everybody still hate each other
but they know how to hide it good
or something

hey can i borrow this

what
why

i promise i will take good care of it

i dunno
they be very sensitive at
work about all this stuff
maybe it
would be good if you

do not you trust i seymour

let we address some discussion to
this piece

i do not like it

can you tell we why

i do not know

i think it be totally weak

yeah it be not right

these be all valid comment but i
think we should see if the artist
have anything to bring to this

well i get the idea when i be do
some research and i discovered that
cook chicken used to be called
coons chicken and so i decided to
do i project base on this discovery
as kind of a comment on racism
and the way racism be whitewash
over in we culture

do you actually do this paint

well no it be more like a find
art object


and how do you think this address
the subject of racism

it be complicate
i guess i be trying
to show how racism used to more
out in the open and now it be hide
or something

and how do an image like this help
we to see that

i be not sure
i mean
i guess because when we see something
like this it seem really shock
and we have to figure out why it be
so shock

i do not really know what to say
enid
another overlong
pause
it be a remarkable achievement

be you kidding
it be a dream job
i can not believe you get a job like
that without even trying
god i
wish that be i job

trying to generate
some enthusiasm

then you leave i no other choice
than to remove it myself

i think we should give the artist a

we should be promoting discussion as
a solution not censorship

i hate sport

how come in all that time i be trying
to get you a date you never ask
i out

you be a beautiful young girl
i
can not imagine you would ever have
have any interest in i except as an
amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity

yeah but still
it be kind of
insulting for a girl to be ignore
like that

i mean
of course i
why would not
i want to go out with you

i dunno
i always feel like
everybody secretly hate i
i be
just paranoid i guess
i mean you

i used to think about one day not
telling anybody and just taking off
and going to some random place
do you ever think about stuff like
that

i guess i probably used to when i
be you age

it would have to be some totally
average day when nobody be expect
it and i would just disappear and they would
never see i again

sound like a healthy way to deal
with you problem

you know what we should do
let we go
get in you car right now and just
take off
we could just drive away
and find some new place and start a
whole new life

a blaze of glory
