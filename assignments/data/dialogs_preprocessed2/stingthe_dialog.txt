Gondorff you going to teach i the
big con or not

on he back checking
underneath one of the horse
you do not act much like you wanted
to learn it

i want to play for Lonnegan

what else
do i get to know

waving Gondorff off
embarrass at his
own outburst
aw right he run the number outta
the south side

going over to start
the machinery
and a pack company a chain of
saving and loan and half the
politician in chicago and new york
there be not a fix in the world
going to cool he out if he blow on you

i will take he anyway

why

because i do not know enough about
killin to kill he

you can not do it alone you know
it
take a mob of guy like you and
enough money to make they look good

we will get by without they

this be not like playin wino on
the street
you get to do more than
outrun the guy

i never play for wino

going right on
ignore hooker remark
you get to keep Lonnegans con even
after you spent he money
and no
matter how much you take from his
he will get more

you be sacred of they be not you

right down to i sock turkey
if
da be half as scared a that
lopear i would not a fall asleep
on they
Lonnegan might kill i
but at least he will not bore i to
death

then you will do it

if i can find a mob that risk it
but no matter what happen i do not
want you comino back to i halfway
through and sayin it be not enough
because it be all you get








showing hooker
photograph of three man
these be comb favorite torpedoe
riley and cole

they do most of the small job but
Lonnegan might not want to use they on
you because they be kinda messy
no
class

we get reason to believe riley be
the guy who hit luther
but if you
see either one of these two find
yourself a crowd or take they
someplace you know you can handle
they

but most of all let we know
if
they get a hit on you we get to
fold up the con
you be too
exposed
you get that

you sure it will be one of these two

no
