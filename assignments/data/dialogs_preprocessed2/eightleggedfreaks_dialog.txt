thanks for the flashback



listening to



freedom
radio
we have put aside the
you


s and conspiracy
theory




for some down home talk back
with we own mayor
wade hale

oh great



thanks harlan
as i be saying
chemical technology have be
looking for viable storage site
and prosperity be lucky enough to
be on that list



lucky
i think most of we be
insulted that some outsider think
we town be a perfect place to
dump toxic waste

right on



be not this just you late get
rich quick scheme



you mall have more employee than
customer




i may have overestimate the need
for square foot of outlet
shop



and you ostrich ranch



if the government subsidy have not
dried up i would still be rolling in
cash

with one phone call i could put
together a deal that would make we
all very rich

they say money do not buy
happiness

they probably do not have any




money pay for kid to go to
college
it pay the mortgage



it put food on the table
have not the people of this town
live handtomouth for long
enough



we be all going to die in this hell
hole

yeah of boredom



would not it be nice not to worry
about surviving retirement
or
taking a shot at that lifelong
dream

think about it harlan you could
buy a commercial transmitter and
start broadcast to a national
audience

it would be nice to get the
message out
let people know the
alien walk among we




if chris mccormick refuse to sell
he mine
the rest of we be out
of luck



i do not think it be fair for one
person to wield that much power
but he be just like he father
selfish
greedy
and more than a
little bit nut

Uhoh



that family have be digging in
those tunnel since the twenties
if there be something down there
do not you think they would have
find it by now



common sense do not apply to
crazy people



might as well be chasing a
leprechaun pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow




lunatic



certifiably nut



at the very least

those McCormicks be just
plainold dumb

i have warn you not to talk about
i family

we have a surprise guest in the
studio

i family build this town


be i suppose to be grateful

that be enough

stay out of this sam

do you hear what he said

i hear

i want he locked up

let we all calm down

we have no economy
people be
barely scraping by
and now we have
be offered the deal of a
lifetime
you do not have the
right to stand in we way

those mine be full of gas
one
spark in the wrong place could
blow this entire valley sky high
do you really want to load that
gun with toxic waste

ChemTech do seismic analysis
vapor check groundwater read
soil sample
they find
isolate methane pocket but no
benzene or hydrogen sulfide


how could they run test
i
do not give they permission to go
into the mine

i ask you a question you greedy
son of a bitch

i be greedy
you be the one
keeping we down so you can search
for gold

do not take another step

you be taking he side

i be trying to keep the peace

you be crazy
just like you
father

he be not crazy

it be okay

maybe you be not gay after all

what be you talking about


you can not take you eye off he
butt

where do you learn that it be okay
to talk to i like this

relax mom
he be hot for an old
guy
i can admit it
why can not
you

do you pop he one

he have it comino
but sam
palmer
that woman abuse she
power

why
because she stopped you from
givin wade another pop

i be not proud of it

patch

i be

that burner on the fritz again

oh something break
what else
be new

of the month

i practically blow myself up
trying to get it back


i be glad you like i bologna
sandwich
maybe you should talk to wade

what be you saying

honey if he really do have a
buyer

you of all people know how much i
dad wanted to find that mother
lode

you daddy wanted to get rich
i
do not think he care how that
happen
if he be still alive
maybe he would sell those mine

and maybe you do not know he so
well after all

you be right
i be just worry
about how we be going to pay these
bill

do not give up on i gladys
