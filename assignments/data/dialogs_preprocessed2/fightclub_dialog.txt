it be on the tip of everyone
tongue
tyler and i just give it a
name

every week tyler give the rule that
he and i decided

the first rule of fight club be
you do not talk about fight club
the
second rule of fight club be you
do not talk about fight club
the
third rule of fight club be when
someone say stop or go limp the
fight be over
fourth rule be
only two guy to a fight
fifth
rule one fight at a time
sixth
rule no shirt no shoe
seventh
rule fight go on as long as they
have to
and the eighth and final
rule if this be you first night
at fight club you have to fight



this kid ricky supply clerk
could not remember whether you ordered
pen with blue ink or black ink



but ricky be a god for ten minute
last week when he trounce an actuary
twice he size



sometimes all you could hear be
flat hard pack sound over the
yell or the wet choke when
someone caught they breath and
sprayed

Ssssstop




even if i could tell someone they have
a good fight i would not be talking
to the same man



who you be in fight club be not who
you be in the rest of the world



you be not alive anywhere like you
be there
but fight club only
exist in the hour between when
fight club start and when fight club
end

what be you get yourself into
every week



after fight club everything else in
you life get the volume turned
down
you can deal with anything

have you finished those report

yes



the people who have power over you
have less and less

calvin klein and tommy Hilfiger said
they should

Selfimprovement be masturbation
Selfdestruction be the answer

to tyler so the
man can hear
you could take he

the trick be not to care




fight club be not about winning or
losing
it be not about word



they hysterical shout be in
tongue like at a pentecostal church

stop



when the fight be over nothing be
solve but nothing matter
