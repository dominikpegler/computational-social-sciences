v
o
people think it be all about misery and desperation and death and
all that shite which be not to be ignore but what they forget
be the pleasure of it
otherwise we would not do it
after all
we be not fucking stupid
at least we be not that fucking stupid

wind about human relationship and all the thing that really
do not matter when you have get a sincere and truthful junk habit

i would say in those day he be a muscular actor in every
sense with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster
but combined with a sly wit to make he a formidable romantic
lead closer in that respect to cary grant

v
o
the only drawback or at least the principal drawback be that you
have to endure all manner of cunt telling you that

no way would i poison i body with that shite all they fucking
chemical no fuck way

it be a waste of you life rent poisoning you body with that
shite

every chance you have ever have you have blown it stuffing you vein
with that filth

get off that stuff rent and get a job

he know a lot about sean connery

that be hardly a substitute

you will need one more hit

no i do not think so

to see you through the night that lie ahead

v
o
we called he the mother superior on account of the length of he
habit
he know all about it
on it off it he know it all
of
course i would have another shot
after all i have work to do

v
o

need
one room which you will not leave
one mattress
tomato

mushroom soup eight tin of for consumption

magnesia milk of one
bottle
paracetamol
mouth wash
vitamin
mineral water
lucozade
pornography
one bucket for urine one for feces and
one for vomitus
one television
and one bottle of valium which i
have already procure from i mother who be in she own domestic
and socially acceptable way also a drug addict
and now i be ready
all i need be a final hit to soothe the pain
while the valium take effect

mikey
it be mark renton
can you help i out

v
o
this be typical of mikey forrester
what the fuck be these
v
o
under the normal run of thing i would have have nothing to do with
the cunt but this be not the normal run of thing

opium suppository
ideal for you purpose
slow release like
bring you down gradually
custom fucking design for you need

i want a fuck hit

that be all i have get

for all the good they have do i i might as well have stick they
up i arse

v
o

the heroin from i last hit be
fade away and the suppository have yet to melt
i be no longer
constipate

v
o
i fantasize about massive pristine convenience
v
o
brilliant gold tap virginal white marble a seat carved from
ebony a cistern full of chanel no
and a flunky hand i
piece of raw silk toilet roll
but under the circumstance i will
settle for anywhere

now
now i be ready

you only live twice

Nineteensixtyseven

running time

one hundred and sixteen minute

director

lewis gilbert

screenwriter

eh ian fleming

fuck off
he never write any of they

so who be it then

you can look it up
how be you feeling since you come off the skag
for myself i be
bore

who write it

but you be looking well it have to be say
healthy
radiant
even

you do not know do you

and i wonder if you would care to go to the park tomorrow

the park

tomorrow afternoon
usual setup

who write it

roald dahl

roald dahl
fuck i

v
o
the down side of coming off junk be that i know i would need to
mix with i friend again in a state of full consciousness
it be
awful
they remind i so much of myself i could hardly bear to
look at they
take sick boy for instance he come off junk at the
same time as i not because he wanted too you understand but
just to annoy i just to show i how easily he could do it
thereby downgrading i own struggle
sneaky fucker do not you
think
and when all i wanted to do be lie along and feel sorry
for myself he insist on telling i once again about his
unify theory of life

it be certainly a phenomenon in all walk of life

what do you mean

well at one time you have get it and then you lose it and it be
go for ever
all walk of life
george best for example have it
and lost it or david bowie or lou reed

some of he solo stuff not bad

no it be not bad but it be not great either be it
and in you
heart you kind of know that although it sound all right it be
actually just shite

so who else

charlie nicholas david niven malcolm mclaren elvis presley


so what be the point you be trying to make

all i be trying to do be help you understand that the name of the
rose be merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward
trajectory

what about the untouchables

i do not rate that at all

despite the academy award

that means fuck all
the sympathy vote


yeah

that be you theory

yeah beautifully fucking illustrated

give i the gun

do you see the beast
have you get it in you sight

clear enough moneypenny
this should present no significant
problem

for a vegetarian rent you be a fuck evil shot

v
o
without heroin i attempted to lead a useful and fulfil life
as a good citizen

good luck spud

cheers

now remember

yeah

if they think you be not trying you be in trouble
first hint of
that they will be on to the this cunt no trying and you
giro be fucking finished right

right

but try too hard

and you might get the fuck job

exactly

nightmare

it be a tightrope spud a fuck tightrope

i problem be that i tend to clam up
i go dumb and i can not answer
any question at all
nerve on the big occasion like a
footballer

try this

little dab of speed be just the ticket

well mr
renton i see that you attend the royal edinburgh
college

indeed yes those halcyon day

one of Edinburghs fine school

oh yes indeed
i look back on i time there with great fondness
and affection
the debate society the first eleven the soft
know of willow on leather

i be an old boy myself you know

oh really

do you recall the school motto

of course the motto the motto

strive hope believe and conquer

exactly
those very word have be i guiding light in what be
after all a dark and often hostile world

mr
renton

yes

you seem eminently suited to this post but i wonder if you could
explain the gap in you employment record

yes i can
the truth well the truth be that i have have a
longstanding problem with heroin addiction
i have be know to
sniff it smoke it swallow it stick it up i arse and inject it
into i vein
i have be trying to combat this addiction but
unless you count social security scam and shoplift i have not
have a regular job in year
i feel it be important to mention this

no actually i go to Craignewton but i be worry that you
would not have hear of it so i put the royal edinburgh college
instead because they be both school right and we be all in
this together and i wanted to put across the general idea rather
than the detail yeah
people get all hung up on detail but
what be the point
like which school
do it matter
why
when
where
or how many grade do i get
could be six could be one
but that be not important
what be important be that i be right
that i be

mr
murphy do you mean that you lie on you application

only to get i foot in the door
show initiative right

you be referred here by the department of employment
there be no
need for you to get you foot in the door as you put it

hey
right
no problem
whatever you say man
you be the man the
governor the dude in the chair like
i be merely here
but
obviously i be
here that be
i hope i be not talking too much
i
do not usually
i think it be all important though be not it

murphy what attract you to the leisure industry

in a word pleasure
i pleasure in other people leisure

i love people
all people
even people that no one else love i
think they be you know
like beggar

homeless people

mate
i would not say i good mate i mean sometimes the boy go
over the score like one time when we i and he be have
a laugh and all of a sudden he be fucking gubbed i in the face
right

mr
murphy leaving you friend aside do you see yourself as
have any weakness

no
well yes
i have to admit it
i be a perfectionist
for i
it be the good or nothing at all
if thing go badly i can not be
bothered but i have a good feel about this interview
seem to
i like it be go pretty well
we have touched on a lot of subject

v
o
picture the scene
wednesday morning in the volley
i and tommy
be playing pool
no problem and i be playing like paul fucking
newman by the way
i be giving the boy here the tanning of a
lifetime
so anyway it come to the final ball the decide shot
of the tournament
i be on the black and he be sitting in the
corner looking all biscuitarsed
then this hard cunt come in
obviously fancied himself
start looking at i
right fuck at
i
trying to put off like just for kick
look at i as if
to say come ahead square go
well you know i i be no looking
for trouble but at the end of the day i be the cunt with the pool
cue and i be game for a swedge
so i squared up casual like
so
what do the hard cunt do or socalled hard cunt
Shites it
put down he drink turn around and get the fuck out of there
and after that the game be mine

v
o
and that be it
that be Begbies story
or at least that be
Begbies version of the story
but a couple of day later i get
the truth from tommy
it be one of he major weakness
he never
tell lie never take drug and never cheated on anyone

well sure it be wednesday morning we be in the volley playing
pool that much be true

v
o
but begbie be playing absolutely fuck gash
he be get a hangover
so bad he can hardly hold the fuck cue never mind pot the
ball
i be do i good to lose trying to humour he like but
it be not do any good
every time i touch the ball i pot
something every time begbie go near the table he fuck it up
so he be get the hump right but finally i manage to set it up so
all he be go to do be pot the black to win one game and salvage a
little pride and maybe not kick i head in right
so he be on the
black pressure shot and it all go wrong big time
what do
he do
pick on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuse he
of putting he off by looking at he
can you believe it
i mean
the poor cunt have not even glance in we direction
he be sitting
there quiet as a mouse when beggar gubs he with the cue
he be
going to chib he i tell you then i think he be going to do
i
the beggar be fuck psycho but he be a mate you know so
what can you do

can i borrow this one

v
o
yeah the guy a psycho but it be true he be a mate as well so
what can you do
just stand back and watch and try not to get
involve
begbie do not do drug either he just do people
that
what he get off on
he own sensory addiction

all right
nobody move
the girl get glassed and no cunt leave
here until we find out which cunt do it

and who the fuck do you think you be

v
o
and as i sit watch the intimate and highly personal video
steal only hour early from one of i good friend i realized
that something important be missing from i life

how be it going with gail

no joy yet

how long be it

six week

six week

it be a nightmare
she told i she do not want we relationship to
start on a physical basis as that be how it would be principally
defined from then on in

where do she come up with that

she read it in cosmopolitan

six week and no sex

i have get ball like watermelon i be telling you

i read it in cosmopolitan

it be an interesting theory

actually it be a nightmare
i have be desperate for a shag but
watch he suffer be just too much fun
you should try it with
tommy

what and deny myself the only pleasure i get from he
do i tell
you about i birthday

what happen

he forget
useless motherfucker

useless motherfucker that be what she called i
i told she i be
sorry but thesis thing happen
let we put it behind we

that be fair enough

yes but then she find out i have buy a ticket for iggy pop the
same night

go ballistic

big time
absolutely fuck radge
it be i or iggy pop time to
decide


so what be it going to be

well i have paid for the ticket

what be you two talking about

football
what be you talking about
and
shopping

v
o
the situation be becoming serious
young renton notice the haste
with which the successful in the sexual sphere as in all other
egregated themselves from the failure

v
o
heroin have robbed renton of he sex drive but now it return
with a vengeance
and as the impotence of those day faded into
memory grim desperation take hold in he sexcrazed mind
he
postjunk libido fuel by alcohol and amphetamine taunt he
remorselessly with he own unsatisfied desire dot
v
o
and with that mark renton have fallen in love

excuse i i do not mean to harass you but i be very impress by
the capable and stylish manner in which you deal with that
situation
i think to myself

you have never tried it before
in fact you do not normally approach

type but if i be prepare to take a chance i might just get to know

witty adventurous passionate love loyal a
little bite crazy a little bit bad but hey do not we girl just
love that

eh

well what be wrong boy
cat get you tongue

i think i left something back at the

be you get in or not pal

do you understand
we relationship be not be redefined
it be developing in an
appropriate organic fashion
i expect you to be a considerate and
thoughtful lover generous but firm
failure on you part to live
up to these very reasonable expectation will result in swift
resumption of a nonsex situation
right
