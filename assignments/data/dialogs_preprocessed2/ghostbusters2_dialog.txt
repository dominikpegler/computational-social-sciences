hi welcome back to the world of the psychic
i be peter Venkman and i be chatting with i guest
author lecturer and of course psychic milton
Anglund
milt you new book be called the end of the
world
be not that kind of like writing about
gum disease
yes it could happen but do you
think anybody want to read a book about it

well i think it be important for people to know
that the world be in danger

okay so can you tell we when it be going to
happen or do we have to buy the book

i predict that the world will end at the
stroke of midnight on new year eve

this year
that be cutting it a little close
be not it
i mean just from a sales point of
view the book just come out right
so you be
not even looking at the paperback release for
maybe a year
and it be going to be at least
another year after that if the thing have
movieoftheweek or miniseries potential
you would have be good off predict
or even just to be safe

this be not just some moneymake scheme
i
do not just make up the date
i have a strong
psychic belief that the world will end on new
year eve

well for you sake i hope you be right
but
i think i other guest may disagree with you
elaine you have another date in mind

accord to i source the world will end
on february in the year

valentines day
that be get to be a bummer
where do you get that date elaine

i received this information from an alien
i
be at the Paramus holiday inn i be have
a drink in the bar when he approached i and
start talking
then he must have used some
sort of ray or a mind control device because
he make i follow he to he room and that be
where he told i about the end of the world

you alien have a room in the holiday inn

it may have be a room on the spacecraft make
up to look like a room in the holiday inn
i
can not be sure peter

no you can not and i think that be the whole
problem with alien
you just can not trust they
you may get some nice one occasionally like
starman or

but most of they turn out to
be some kind of lizard
anyway we be just
about out of time
do he wrapup right

next week on world of the psychic hairless
pet
until then this be peter Venkman saying

long long time

it should not be hard with this list of charge

good
very good
the mayor and future
governor will not forget this

nice going Venkman
violate a judicial
restrain order willful destruction of
public property fraud malicious mischief
smooth move

at you first parole hear

Fianella please look at exhibit
through on the table over there
do you
recognize that equipment

o
c

that be the stuff the cop find in they
truck

do you know what this equipment be used for

i do not know
catching ghost i guess

may i remind the court that the defendant
be under a judicial restrain order that
specifically forbid they from performing
service as paranormal investigator and
eliminator

so noted

now mr
Fianella can you identify the
substance in the jar on the table marked
exhibit

i be working underground for con ed for
year and i never see anything like that
in i life
we checked out that tunnel the
next day and we do not find nothing
if it
be down there they must have put it there

hey i do not imagine it
there must have
be ten thousand gallon of it down there

it may be eb and flowing from some tidal
source

should i say that

i doubt that they would believe we


so like you be just trying to help out
you old friend because she be scare and
you do not really mean to do anything bad
and you really love the city and will not ever
do anything like this again right

objection you honor
he be leading the
witness

the witness be leading he
sustained

okay let i rephrase that question
do not you once coach a basketball team for
underprivileged child

yes i do
we be city champ

objection
irrelevant and immaterial

sustained
mr
tully do you have anything
to ask this witness that may have some
bearing on this case

do i

no i think you have helped they enough already

no i guess not
you witness

so dr
Venkman please explain to the court
why it be you and you codefendants take it
upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
middle of the street

Seventyseventh and first avenue have so many
hole already we do not think anyone would
notice

keep that up mister and i will find you in
contempt

sorry you honor but when somebody set
i up like that i can not resist

i will ask you again dr
Venkman
why be
you digging the hole
and please remember
that you be under oath

i have i finger crossed when they swear i
in but i be going to tell you the truth
there be thing in this world that go way
beyond human understand thing that
can not be explain and that most people do not
want to know about anyway
that be where we
come in

so what be you saying
that the world of
the supernatural be you special province

no i guess i be just saying that shit happen
and somebody have to deal with it


do the counsel for the defense wish to
make any final arguements

you honor may i approach the bench

yes

can i have some of you water

get on with it counselor

you honor lady and gentleman of the
he remember there be no
jury
audience

a big problem for everybody
i be stick in
an elevator for about three hour and i have
to go to the bathroom the whole time but i
do not blame they because once i turned into
a dog and they helped i
thank you

way to go
concise and to the point

that be it
that be all you have to say

do i forget something

that be unquestionably the bad
presentation of a case i have ever hear in a
court of law
i ought to cite you for
contempt and have you disbar
as for
you client peter Venkman raymond Stantz
and egon spengler on the charge of
conspiracy fraud and the willful destruction
of public property i find you guilty on all
count
i order you to pay fine in the
amount of each and i sentence you to
eighteen month in the city correctional
facility at Rykers island

Uhoh she be twitchin

record as saying that there be no place in
decent society for fake charlatan and
trickster like you who prey on the
gullibility of innocent people
you be
beneath the contempt of this court
and
believe i if i hand be not tied by the
unalterable fetter of the law a law which
have become in i view far too permissive and
inadequate in it be standard of punishment
i would invoke the tradition of we
illustrious forebearers reach back to a
sterne pure justice and have you burned
at the stake

under the table boy

oh i god
the Scoleri brother

you have get to stop they
please

expose i client to serious criminal
penalty

you shirt than we get in you mouth


somewhat embarrass to
be there
i be sorry
be you on you way out

come on in
be we have a pajama party

peter the bathtub tried to eat oscar

have serious doubt
but coming from you
i can not honestly say i be surprise

i must be losing i mind
at the museum
today i could have sworn that terrible
paint of vigo look right at i

who could blame he
be you wearing this
nightgown

i do not know what to do anymore

i will get ray and egon to check out the
bathtub
you well stay here

now this kid have a serious nudity problem

this be joe Namaths old number you know
you could get a lot of chick with this
just do not pee in it

peter what about the bathtub

we will take care of that
ray pete
listen get over to danas right
away
she bathtub pulled a fast one
tried to eat the kid

sound like another slime job
no
they be all right
they be here now
right

they be going over there right now
you
might as well make yourself at home
let
i show you around
this be the cuisine de maison

we may have to wash some of these if you get
hungry
but there be no food anyway so forget
about it
i have all kind of carryout
menu if you feel like order

bathroom right here let i just tidy
up a few thing

peter this be very nice but you do not have
to do any of this you know



the shower work but it be a little tricky
they be both marked hot
it take a little
practice but at least this one will not try
and eat you

be careful on that sofa it be a buttbiter
but the bed good and i just changed the
sheet so if you get tire feel free
in
fact i think you should definitely plan on
spending the night here

really
and how would we handle the sleep
arrangement

for i it be good if i sleep on i side and
you spoon up right behind i with you arm
around i
if we go the other way i be
afraid you hair will be get in i face
all night

how about you on the sofa and i in bed with
the baby

or we could do that

thank you
poor baby
i think i should put he down
now

i will put he down for you
you be way too short
and you bellybutton
stick out
you be nothing but a burden to
you poor mother


do you find anything at danas

nothing
just some moodslime residue in
and around the bathtub
but we do turn up
some interesting stuff on this vigo character
you mention
i find the name vigo the
carpathian in leon Zundingers magicians
martyr and madman
listen to this

vigo the carpathian bear die

hundred and five year
he really hung
on do not he

and he do not die of old age either
he be
poison stabbed shot hung stretched
disemboweled draw and quarter

i guess he be not too popular at the end
there

no not exactly a man of the people
also known as vigo the cruel vigo the
torturer vigo the despised and vigo the
unholy


this guy be a bad monkey
he dabble in
all the black arts and listen to this
prophecy
just before he head die his
last word be death be but a door time
be but a window
i will be back

breed surge in the cockroach population

a small mining operation and then one day a
beautiful princess come to live with they

it be really not a bad place
it just need
a woman touch

so they barter room and board in exchange
for housekeeping service which be a good
deal for all of they because then they do not
have to withhold tax and social security

gassed up the car with super unleaded

an old car like this that end up saving

humanity left in this burnedout burg
