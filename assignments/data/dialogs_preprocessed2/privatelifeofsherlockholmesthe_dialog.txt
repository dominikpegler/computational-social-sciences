
i

diamond

somewhere in the vault of a bank in
london be a tin dispatch box with i name
on it
it be not to be open until
fifty year after i death

it contain certain memento of i long
association with a man who elevated the
science of deduction to an art the
world first and undoubtedly most
famous consulting detective

to i heir
in i lifetime i have recorded some
sixty case demonstrate the singular
gift of i friend sherlock holmes
dealing with everything from the hound of
the baskervilles to he mysterious
brother mycroft and the devilish
professor moriarty
but there be other
adventure which for reason of
discretion i have decided to withhold
from the public until this much later
date
they involve matter of a delicate
and sometimes scandalous nature as will
shortly become apparent


it be august of and we be
returning from yorkshire where holmes
have solve the baffling murder of colonel
Abernetty


you may recall that he broke the
murderer alibi by measuring the depth
to which the parsley have sunk in the
butter on a hot day


he be the most brilliant man i have ever
known and i dare say people have
envied i for sharing that flat with he
in baker street

i will grant you he be stimulate but
he could also be moody unpredictable
egocentric and more often than not
completely infuriate as we
landlady mrs
hudson can attest
bless she kind soul



i do wish you would give i a little more
warn when you come home unexpected
i
would have roast a goose and have
some flower for you

i dear mrs
hudson criminal be as
unpredictable as headcolds
you never
quite know when you be going to catch
one


i will unpack you bag

here an advance copy of strand
magazine
they have printed the redheaded league




leaf through the
magazine







remove inverness and
deerstalker



hold out a letter he be be
read











i dear friend as well as i dear
doctor i only resort to narcotic when
i be suffering from acute boredom when
there be no interesting case to engage
i mind
holding out one of the open
letter
look at this an urgent appeal to find
six miss midget

do you say midget

six of they the tumbling piccolo
an acrobatic act with some circus

disappear between london and bristol
do not you find that intriguing

extremely so
you see they be not only
midget but also anarchist

anarchist

by now they have be smuggle to vienna
dressed as little girl in burgundy
pinafore
they be to greet the czar of
all the russias when he arrive at the
railway station
they will be carrying
bouquet of flower concealed in each
bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse

you really think so

not at all
the circus owner offer i
five pound for i service that be not
even a pound a midget

so obviously he be a stingy blighter and
the little chap simply run off to join
another circus

oh
and it sound so promise

there be no great crime anymore
watson
the criminal class have lost all
enterprise and originality
at good they
commit some bungling villainy with a
motive so transparent that even a
scotland yard official can see through
it

mrs
hudson




yes
what be it
what have i do now

there be something miss from i desk


miss

something very crucial
you have be tidy up against i
explicit order


oh i make sure not to disturb anything

dust mrs
hudson be an essential part
of i file system
by the thickness of
it i can date any document immediately



some of the dust be this thick

that would be march



how can you stand this
why do not you
let i air the room out

please mrs
hudson he be working on a
definitive study of tobacco ash


i be sure there be a cry need for that


in we endeavor it be sometimes vital
to distinguish between say the ash of
a macedonian cigarette and a jamaican
cigar
sor far he have classified
different kind of ash


all of which will end up on i rug

Thatll be enough mrs
hudson


all right
if you gentleman want to stay
here and suffocate

she be right
i be suffocate

let i open a window

not from lack of air from lack of
activity
sitting here week after week
blowing smoke ring stare through a
microscope there be no challenge in
that

personally i consider it a major
contribution to scientific criminology

how i envy you you mind watson

you do


it be placid imperturbable prosaic
but
i mind rebel against stagnation
it be
like a race engine tearing itself to
piece because it be not connected up with
the work for which it be build

holmes

holmes where be you selfcontrol

fair question

be not you ashamed of yourself

thoroughly
but this will take care of
it



naturally i do not mean to imply that i
friend be always on cocaine sometimes
it be opium sometimes it be hashish
and once he go one of these dreadful
binge there be no telling how long it
would last

the only reason you moved in with i be
to have a steady supply of stimulant

now now watson you must not
underestimate you other charm

holmes i warn you
if you lock yourself
in there once more

i intend to do nothing of the sort

not until you replace this needle
it be
get rather blunt


i make you some tea and cress sandwich


mrs
hudson i want you to pack i bag


be you going away for the weekend

and beyond
i be moving out


moving out

i be just as surprise as you be

you hear i mrs
hudson
and let we not
waste any time

may i be so bold as to ask where you
going

i do not know yet
but i intend to resume
i practice
i be after all a doctor
and quite a competent one if i say so as
should not

you will find it very dull snip out
tonsil and flush out kidney

if you be looking for you medical bag
you hide it under the moorish table
which show a little more imagination
than last time when it be under you
bed


i will of course continue to pay i
half of the rent until you find someone
to share these room with you

where be i going to find anyone who will
put up with i rather eccentric habit

taking hypodermic needle out
of bag
here a fresh needle and here i
farewell present to you

if you want to destroy yourself go right
ahead
but i will not sit by and watch you
do it

watson


it be so sad
you and mr
holmes after
all these year


please mrs
hudson none of that


i will wash this and send it on to you

i will be at browns hotel


i know how it feel i once go
through a divorce myself

actually i be rather looking forward to
it
leading a normal life again
regular office hour nine to three
and if occasionally there be an emergency
call in the middle of the night i know
it be going be appendicitis and not an ax
murder
let holmes go mucking about in
the fog and the sleet looking for a
bloodstained collarbutton out on the
moor with some demented hound snap
at he behind


mr
holmes


please mrs
hudson
you be in i line
of fire


how many time have i tell you i will not
tolerate pistol practice on i premise
i should have evict you when you shoot
they hole in i wall

merely celebrating she Majestys golden
jubilee


look at that mess you make

it be all right mrs
hudson
i will clean
it up
while you unpack i thing


unpack

you hear he

thank you holmes
i know how difficult
it must have be for you


not really
it be simple choice between
a bad habit and a good companion

you have make i very happy

i have often be accused of be cold and
unemotional
i admit to it
and yet in
i cold unemotional way i be very fond
of you watson

i know that
but one like to hear these
thing occasionally

look at this
cover with that nasty
stuff
i would well dry it off

i will do it

for a moment i be worry that you be
going to let i walk out that you
be not even going to try to stop i

now watson you know there be nothing i
would not do to keep you here


it be not the first not the last time he
trick i like that
normally i be
incline to forgive he


but on one occasion he do something
that be so utterly unforgivable that i
would gladly have murdered he have it
not be for i saintly disposition

why will not you go
it be the final
performance of the imperial russian
ballet the house have be sell out for
month

whoever send they must be in great
distress
the note say

world who can help i

trap

kill you

that be right
it be a plot to bore i to
death
i detest ballet

what be going on
what happen to the
girl

why
do you not prefer it this way

what way


you do not have to pretend
mr
holmes
told we everything about you and he

about i and he

come now no need to be bashful
we be
not bourgeois
maybe with doctor and
detective be unusual but in ballet
be very usual

what be

caprice of mother nature
look at pavel
and mischa and boris and dmitri

and ilya and sergei
break off rock he hand
back and forth
sergei half and half



holmes

holmes

there you be you wretch
you rotter
you blackguard
of all the vile
unspeakable fabrication
what do you
have to say for yourself

do not just sit there speak up man


holmes
be you all right holmes

from the sound of you footstep i
gathered that you be not in a
particularly amiable mood

how could you do a dastardly thing like
that to i
what the deuce be you
think of

watson you have i most abject
apology
but have you ever be
cornered by a madwoman
it seem like
the only way to get out of it without
hurting she feeling

what about i feeling
and i
reputation
do you realize the gravity
of what you have do
the possible
repercussion

so there be a little gossip about you
in st
petersburg

these thing spread like wildfire
i can
just hear those malicious whisper behind
i back
i will never be able to show i
face in polite society

and if it ever get back to i old
regiment you do not know the fifth
northumberland fusiliers they will
strike i off the roll they will cut
off i pension

watson you be running amok

Dishonored disgraced ostracize
what
be i to do

well for one thing i would get rid of that
flower

you may think this be funny but we be
both in the same boat
we must take
desperate measure
we must stop this
talk
maybe if we get marry

then they would really talk

obviously we cannot continue to live
under the same roof
we must move apart

of course we can still see each other
clandestinely on remote bench in
hyde park and in the waiting room of
suburban railway station

a change in attitude
defiant
the whole thing be ridiculous
we have
nothing to hide

that be what i have be trying to tell you


let somebody start a rumor just one
ugly word and we will sue they for
slander

nobody would dare
after all you have
an enviable record with the fair sex

damn right
i can get woman from three
continent to testify for i
and you
can get woman to vouch for you too
can not you holmes

can you holmes

good night watson

holmes let i ask you a question
i hope i be not be presumptuous but
there have be woman in you life

the answer be yes
you be be presumptuous
good night

holmes



what indeed be he attitude toward
woman
be there some secret he be
holding back or be he just a think
machine incapable of any emotion

i be not to get the answer until we
become involve in what i consider to be
the most outrageous case in all we year
together


be you expect someone

not at this hour

maybe mrs
hudson be entertain

i never find she so

what be it mrs
hudson


there be a cabbie here he say you owe
he twoandsix

for what

for the fare guv
the young lady
do not have any money

what young lady

this one


well
what have we here
who be you miss
what happen to you

i do not know

that be all she keep saying i do not
know i do not know

where do she come from

from the river
i be driving down the
embankment just below westminster
bridge and there she be in the water
drown

it be not easy guv what with the
cold water and she fighting i

why do you bring she here

because i find this in she hand
give a square of soggy
cardboard to watson
baker street that be right
be not it


young lady what do you want at this
address

i do not remember

rather perplex would not you say

rather

well gentleman you want she
it be
twoandsix or shall i throw she back

wet clothes

she be suffering from shock and exposure

there be some print on the back of
this but it seem to have come off in
the water

look at this she be have a nasty blow on
the head


could she have hit she head when she fell
or jump into the river

no
the blood have already coagulate
so it would appear that she be the
victim of a deliberate attack
get i
bag will you

who be you

i be dr
watson and this be mr
sherlock holmes
do the name mean
anything to you

no

think

i be trying

can you think of you own name

a beat then shake she
head
no

she be obviously have a concussion which
often lead to temporary amnesia

so all we know be that she be cosh on
the head dump into the thames and
subsequently dump into we lap


we know a lot more than that
from she
accent we know she be foreign from
she ring we know she be marry and
there be one other clue we have
something i deduce while i be helping
she up the stairs
no corset

importantly she must be protected
there have already be one attempt on she
life

lumpy as
usual i suppose

oh there you be holmes
we be just
wonder how
point from he bedroom to
holmes


we certainly be

mrs
hudson why do not you go down to the
kitchen get a towel and wipe that
look of disapproval off you face



liberty in i house

you can not really blame she i mean the
way it look if i do not know you
well i might suspect you would taken
advantage of the young lady

as a matter of fact i do take advantage
of she
would you hand i the butter
knife please

of course

you do what

taking butterknife from
he
thank you

holmes this be reprehensible
where be
you professional ethics
have you no
sense of decency no shame

none whatsoever
if you must know i
find she body quite reward

you cad

especially the palm of she right hand


i would rather not hear about it

very well
then i will not bother to tell
you how i trace she suitcase

that be she suitcase

remember that piece of soggy cardboard
with we address on it
it be a luggage
ticket the number rub off on she
hand
and since she must have arrive
from brussels by the boat train i
conclude that she have check she
belongings at victoria station

by jove
if you be right we should find
a clue to she identity

or at least a pink negligee with maribou
feather

Voila

let we see what else be in here

now we be get somewhere

who do you suppose this be


come in madame Valladon
you be gabrielle Valladon

yes

and this be you husband emile Valladon

yes

sorry to have ransack you valise
but
since you come to we for help

where be i

baker street

oh yes
a beat as she orient
herself
which of you be mr
holmes and which be
dr
watson

dr
watson be the handsome one

that be the way he affect most woman


coffee
you want strong coffee

it be all so confuse

let we try to sort it out
you come to
london looking for you husband

yes
he be a mining engineer
we be
married five year ago in the congo

where you husband be working in a
copper mine

how do you know

you wedding ring it be make of copper

last year he invent a new kind of air
pump and be hired by an english
company jonah limit

hand she cup of of
coffee
here you be

jonah limit
go on

we have be writing to each other
regularly
then suddenly three week
ago he letter stopped
i keep writing
but no answer
finally i decided to
go to that address


ashdown street

yes
it be just an empty store nobody
there
then i tried to find jonah
limit
no such company exist

how decidedly odd

madame Valladon can you think of any
reason why you husband should have lie
to you about thesis thing

emile
never
he love i and i love
he

so i gathered

i go to the police they said they
would send out a miss person report
but they do not sound too encourage
then i go to the belgian embassy and
explain the situation to they and
they suggested that i consult you

you could have do badly

i be on i way here and suddenly
there be footstep behind i and a
hand over i mouth and the smell of
choloroform and the next thing i know
i be in the water and then a man be
wrapping i in a blanket

madame Valladon somebody tried to kill
you last night
do you have any idea who
could have do it


i do not understand any of it
what do it all mean mr
holmes
where
be i husband
you must help i find
he

we will do we good i assure you

madame Valladon i want you to send one
more letter to you husband

to emile Valladon ashdown street
what be that number


what do you want i to say in the
letter

nothing

you be sending an empty sheet of paper to
an empty shop

that empty shop be obviously be used
as an accomodation address or letter
drop
but what get drop must be
picked up
the question be how
and
by whom
and why



hammer
chisel

here

it be so strange to think i have be
writing to a place like this all these
month


look at all these canary
do you
suppose this could have be a pet shop

maybe
here come we letter

now we be face with the most nerve
wrack part of the detective job
do nothing

mr
holmes

yes

i do not know how i be going to pay you for
all this
the purse with i money be
somewhere at the bottom of the thames

it could be bad
you could be at the
bottom of the thames much to you
discomfort and much to i chagrin

i do not understand how anybody pick up
letter here
no footprint just track
what do
it mean


i would surmise somebody be use ice
skate if it be not for a conspicuous
absence of ice

what do we do now

this way

good morning i pretty
here mum
with you breakfast
do you think i would
forgotten you

what be they do with all those
canary
what be going on up there

no
that be going to be pick up in

the art of concealment i dear watson
be merely a matter of be in the right
place at the right time

do you hear what she said
you really
think emile be going to pick up the
letter himself

it certainly would simplify thing
would not it

Maildrops and canary and wheelchair
and what be all that about jonah
and
what do you suppose they be do up
there
and where be up there

i guess would be scotland
inverness

of they cage
the inverness courier

i have always suspected that there be
some underground connection between this
stodgy and seemingly calcify
establishment and the foreign office in

it seem to i that the diogenes club be
here there and everywhere

of the nile

Glennahurich

you know a valley with a yew
tree


it be about a mile out of town
why would you be wanting to go there

well if it be get a view it might be a
nice place for a picnic

it be get a view right enough but it be
no place for a picnic

why not

because it be a cemetary



the three box
be that it holmes

i would think so

the two small one they must be
child coffin

earth to earth ash to ash dust
to dust

in sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life through we
lord jesus christ
amen

it be so sad

sad and rather odd
there be no
flower and no mourner

morning

morning

work you hard dad

not really
this be healthy country
sometimes you sit around for week with
nothing to do
then you get three in one
day

what happen

an accident
aye
father and two son
they say they be find floating in
the loch

local people

no
nobody around here know they
the
story be that they boat capsize in a
swell but i do not believe it


what do you believe

you may think i be an old fool or an old
drink but i have live around loch ness
all i life

be you trying to tell we it be the
monster

damn right
MacLarnin see the kid
face when they be pull out of the
water look like old man must have
die of fright

incredible

be it
last easter sunday i wife and
i we be on we way to service when
suddenly
but what be the use

taking some coin out of he
pocket
here you be dad
hand they to the grave
digger

thank you
you look like nice people
if you be wanting a holiday in scotland
go to loch lomond go to holy loch but
stay away from loch ness

to think that people still believe in
that nonsense
here we be living in
the nineteenth century


i be ashamed to admit it but i be
relieve when he mention a father and
two boy
it could possibly have
anything to do with emile

it would appear not

however there still remains the clue of
the castle and the red runner wherever
it may be

if they be unidentified grave why be
those boy bringing flower

because it be they brother who have just
be buried

they brother

and they be not boy
they be as tall as
they will ever grow
hand i some pebble
will you

pebble


they be how do you say it in english
nains

midget

boy with the face of old man

i still do not see

would it help if i told you they be
acrobat

not at all

do you remember a tumble act six
brother missing from the circus

oh yes that case you turned down i
completely forget

some of we be curse with memory like
flypaper
and stick there be a
stagger of miscellaneous date mostly
useless


mr
holmes be those be not child
then

quite
the question now be who be in
the third grave


holmes
she be faint

hand i that lantern

it be Valladon be not it

obviously
what be not so obvious be why
he wedding ring have turn green


and why there be three dead canary
in the coffin
white canary



you have a lovely view of the loch from
here as soon as the morning mist roll
away
cross to desk pick up
guide book
if you have a mind to do any sightseeing
here a guide to the local point of
interest

thank you

this way please
i will show you to you
room

i suppose you be putting i in the
basement

no you room be in the attic

good

it be the privy that be in the basement

may i have you wedding ring please


just as i think
there be a distinct
difference in color between you ring and
you husband
which lead i to believe that the because
of death be not drowning
i wish you would stop that
stop it

i be sorry

i know it be not easy
but you must
remember that we be that nice couple from
london on holiday in the highlands

i will try

that be much good

thank you

now if i may proceed without **further/far
interruption

mr
ashdown


mr
ashdown

holmes
i see it
i see it from the
attic
it be out there in the lake

you see what

the telescope
where be the telescope

what do you see

the monster

the monster


there it be
there it be

look for yourself

see it
see it

i see nothing

nothing

it be go

go
maybe it be never there

i swear to you i see it clear as
anything


watson as you so succinctly put it we
be living in the nineteenth century

maybe that gravedigger be right the
swell and the boat overturn

monsieur Valladon may have be find in
the lake but he do not drown
he
die of asphyxiation

asphyxiation

there be only one substance that can turn
a copper ring green and bleach the color
out of canary chlorine gas

that may be
but the fact remains that i
see something out there

figment of you imagination
now let
we be logical
the only concrete lead we
have be the reference to the castle
pick up guide book from
desk open it to map
the question be which castle

you call yourself logical
you be the
least logical man i know

be i


how can you say it be a figment of i
imagination when for year you have be
saying i have no imagination whatsoever



we have so far investigate eight drafty
castle have we bicycle attack by
sheep and we ear assault by bagpipe
and we be exactly where we start

guess what the one next to i be reading
the book of jonah be not that odd

quite

what be it dear

with this castle
it be just a pile of
rubble

then why be they taking precaution

why indeed
let we go

when rebuff at the front door one
only choice be to try the tradesman
entrance

be you the guide here

yes
the castle be closed to the public
while work be going on

what be they do

the preservation of scottish monument

too bad
i particularly wanted i wife
to see urquhart castle

of the most interesting example of
about be not it

racket

exposed to saltwater produce chlorine
gas
would you mind clasp you hand
watson

front from the back from the side from
land from water
what now
be you
planning to spend the night out here

the german disposed of she three week
ago in brussels
this be gabrielle
Valladon

the woman who be bring to you house
in the middle of the night apparently
fish out of the thames and
apparently suffering from amnesia be
in fact ilse von Hoffmanstal one of
they most skillful agent
be i going
too fast for one of the good brain in
england


go on

they planted she on you quite neatly i
must admit so that you could lead they
to they objective the air pump
very
much like use a hog to find truffle
and now perhaps you would care to join i
i
be expect a certain royal personage
from balmoral


you majesty

i trust you have a pleasant journey
madam

it be long and it be tedious
and it
have well be worth we while mr
holmes

i can assure you madam it will be

now what be this curious ship we be
suppose to christen

we call it a submersible madam
it
travel under water

under water
what a fantastic idea














this be i brother sherlock madam

ah yes
sherlock holmes
we have be
following you exploit with great
interest

thank you madam

be you engaged in one of you
fascinating case at the moment

in a manner of speaking madam

when can we expect to read dr
watsons
account of the case

i hope never madam
it have not be one
of i more successful endeavor

ah the ceremony be about to begin
now where be this underwater ship of
yours

in the dungeon madam

the dungeon
what a peculiar place to
keep it
well let we get on with it gentleman


there she madam
she Majestys ship
jonah

and what may we ask be the purpose of
that hideous gargoyle

it be merely a decoy madam


oh
to frighten away the shark we
imagine

something of the sort
the crew will
now demonstrate the working of the
submersible

stand to

be not they rather small for sailor

they be
but because of the size of the
craft the navy make an exception

they should make it a rule
it be quite
fatiguing to pin on all those medal
while standing on we toe

this be the main engine which propel it
under water at the rate of two knot
the stabilize mechanism the multi
stage compressor the ballast tank
trimmer the airpump which filter and
recirculates the air


how charming

the air pump madam

the canary
must make the crew feel at
home

yes madam
these be the lever for
firing the torpedoe which be accurate
up to as much as foot the
periscope for scanning the surface of the
water

but where be the glass bottom

the what madam

the glass bottom

you know to see the fist

and the plant and the coral

that be not quite the idea madam



jonah be be commission as a warship

warship
stop that noise
stop it

madam if i may explain

you have good


the admiralty regards this craft as the
ultimate weapon in naval warfare
it can
seek out enemy ship and destroy they
with these torpedoe while remain
completely invisible

you mean in can fire at other vessel
while under water

yes madam

without any warn

that be correct madam

and without showing she color

indeed madam

mr
holmes we be not amuse
it be unsportsmanlike it be unenglish
and it be in very poor taste
we will
have none of it

i beg you pardon madam

sometimes we despair of the state of the
world
what will scientist think of
next

that be precisely it madam
at this very
moment the german under count von
zeppelin be experiment with a
dirigible


dirigible
and what pray be that

rigid balloon which could fly over
london and drop a bomb on buckingham
palace
it be be developed at the
express order of kaiser wilhelm the
second

nonsense
we refuse to believe that we
grandson willie would do a thing like
that

we have conclusive proof madam
we
agent in friedrichshafen a man named
ibbetson actually see the dirigible and
make a draw of it
unfortunately he
be apprehend before he could cross the
border

nevertheless we do not want any part of
this beastly invention
get rid of it
scuttle it
the sooner the good

may i point out madam

and do not concern yourself about that
dirigible drop bomb on we
we shall
write a very sharp note to the kaiser
now we wish to return to balmoral

well mycroft it seem we have both be
undone by a woman
mycroft be stare at the
sub
what a shame

all that superb engineering and all that
cunning espionage for nought

not necessarily
if the german want
that submersible so badly why do not we
give it to they

give it to they

invite they aboard for the final journey
seven hundred foot straight down

and how be you going to arrange that

i be rather counting on you to do it
since you be on such intimate term with
fraulein von Hoffmanstal

shall we say goodbye to she majesty



sorry about that
but as long as you be
up what be the german word for castle
schloss be not it

i think so

and how would you say under the castle
unter das Schlss
or die schloss

i do not know
i german be not that good

you trappist friend be out there
waiting to hear from you it be a chilly
morning we do not want to keep they
standing around too long do we fraulein
Hoffmanstal
gabrielle look at he
without answering
come now
it be too late to play cat and
mouse

unter dem schloss


thank you
here you signal device it be a
bit damp i be afraid would you care to
let they know where they can find the
submersible
gabrielle make no move to
take the parasol
no
then i will just have to do it myself
i only hope i morse code be adequate to
the occasion













i would suggest you get you thing
together
mycroft will be here to take
you into custody

i never have you fool for a moment do
i
you know right from the begin
when the cabbie bring i to baker
street

let i see not quite that soon

it be so funny
i ask for this
assignment you know
i be scheduled to
go to japan but i could not resist the
challenge of coming up against the good
i be sorry i do not give you a close
game

close enough

you be just be kind
i failed
miserably

we all have occasional failure
fortunately dr
watson never write
about mine



holmes
holmes

holmes

holmes i see it again that thing
it come from the castle it be out there


it be out there
now it be go

go


forever
look for yourself

bottle of champagne
and a bible

that be all that be left of


jonah

it would seem that somebody carelessly
loosen the bolt of the submersible
what a fit end for Trappists now
they be resting in eternal silence at
the bottom of the lake

do you know what he be talking about

fraulein von Hoffmanstal

yes mr
holmes
i be all ready


if there be one thing i like about the
prussian it be they punctuality

if there be one thing i dislike about the
british it be they climate
i
understand you jail be quite damp
and you heat facility totally
inadequate

they be
but you be not going to jail
you be going back to germany

germany

you will be conduct to the SwissGerman
border and be exchanged for one of we
agent a man named ibbetson

thank you

do not thank i
thank i brother
it
be he idea

frankly i think we be making a very
poor deal
you much good than most
operative working for british
intelligence
do not you agree sherlock

with a small but gallant bow
to gabrielle
and good than some consult
detective


shall we

i will take that
gentleman

all right holmes you do not have to
explain anything to i if you do not want
to

i appreciate that watson

after all i be only you official
biographer

anyway i do not think she would care to have
this story spread all over strand
magazine

the public have a right to know these
thing
if she be a german spy why
should we concern ourselves about she
feeling


if i promised not to write a word about
it would you enlighten i
as you
friend as you valet

quiet
i be trying to read a personal
message

message

what be she saying

Auf Wiedersehn

Auf Weider
the nerve



hmmm
letter from the diogenes club

maybe mycroft be putting you up for
membership

if only to have the distinct pleasure of
blackballing he brother

be not you going to finish you
breakfast

th december
dear sherlock
i source in tokyo inform i that ilse
von Hoffmanstal be arrested last week by
the japanese counterintelligence service
for spying on naval installation in
yokohama harbour
after a secret trial
she be summarily executed by a fire
squad
it might interest you to know that
she have be living in japan these past
few month under the name of mrs
ashdown
sincerely
mycroft

holmes i be terribly sorry about this

where be it watson

in the file
may to july

you be get good


good morning watson
just happen to be in the neighborhood
and i think

what be it this time inspector Lestrade

we have have three rather nasty murder in
whitechapel
all lady of easy virtue
you may read something about it the
newspaper be refer to the killer as
jack the ripper

yes i think i have

some of we at scotland yard be
wonder if perhaps mr
holmes would be
willing to

i be sorry Lestrade
but at the moment
holmes be working on another problem

trying to hide his
disappointment
oh
well i just think it be the
kind of case that might interest he
i
dare say we can solve it without his
help


oh i be sure you will

good day Lestrade
