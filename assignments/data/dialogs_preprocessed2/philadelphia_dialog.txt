version that i must prove to
you
point number one
andrew

point
number two
andrew beckett

point number four
they panicked
and in they panic they do what
most of we would like to do with

who have it as far away from we
as possible


the behavior of andrew Becketts
employer may seem reasonable to
you
it do to i
after all
be a deadly incurable disease


but however you come to judge the
behavior of charles wheeler and
he partner in moral ethical
human term
when they fired
andrew beckett because he have



and when lawyer break the law
when this society lose respect
for the law when that day come
we cherish institution will be
burned to the ground and we
child and grandchildren will
live like savage


fact
andrew beckett perform
at a consistently mediocre
level

error on a multimillion dollar
lawsuit

reckless behavior have cut short
he life
and in he anger he
rage he be lashing out

the kind of person i
think i wanted to be

what kind of person be that

possess of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law
razor
sharp litigator a genuine
leader gift at bringing out
the very good in other
an
awesome ability to illuminate
the most complex of legal
concept to colleague
courtroom the person on the
street
the kind of person
who play three set of tennis but
do not sweat
but underneath the
elegant surface be an
adventurous spirit

obviously at this time you
be not sick

it be possible i be infected with
the virus at that time but i
be not diagnose until several year
later

look now

i still be

in the year you worked at Wyant
wheeler do you ever tell
charles wheeler you be gay

no
i do not

can you explain
you do not

you do not bring you personal
life into a law firm
you be
not suppose to
a personal
life really
anyway i do
plan to tell charles
eventually
but then this
thing happen at the tennis
club

Longstreets interested in the
harrisburg deal

i be seeing he this afternoon

somebody start telling joke

it be
the only thing i have ever wanted to do

what do you love about it

well
many thing
but i
think the thing i love the most
be that every once in a while
not that often but
occasionally
you get to be
part of justice be do
it be really quite a thrill when
that happen


you said early you aspire to
be the kind of person who have
an adventurous spirit
be
that correct

something like that

do you take risk

in i work
yes
calculate
risk
you have to

in general
do you take risk
in other area of you life

not unnecessary one

have you ever be to the apollo
cinema on sansom street

have you ever have sex with
someone in that theater



yes


once



i be robert

andrew


now what do we do

i think we will figure it out

when
approximately what year do
this event take place

i guess it be

be you aware in or
that there be a fatal disease
out there called and that
you could contract it through
sexual activity

it be impossible to know exactly
when or how i be infected with

but you
have anonymous
sex in porno theaters in
and

that happen once
people
be not talking about then
the way we be now
or safe
sex

you would
of in

i would hear of
plague gay cancer but
we
do not know how you could get it
or that it could kill you

do you need a break

no

while you be employed at Wyant
wheeler you do everything you
could to make sure no one know
you be an active homosexual
correct

that be
correct
i never lie
about it

do you keep a picture of you
lover on you desk

no

do other lawyer at the firm keep
picture of they spouse or
fiances on they desk



some do
i do not

as a homosexual one be often forced
to conceal one sexuality be
that right

in some situation

be not it true you have spent you
life pretend to be something
you be not so much so that the
art of concealment and dishonesty
have become second nature to you

objection

i will withdraw it
mr
beckett
be you living with miguel
alvarez in or when you
have you anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater

yes

you could have infected he be not
that right

miguel have not be infected
as
i said we be not aware of
then or how it be spread

really

yes

you have testify the lesion on
you face be visible to the
people you worked with correct

that be right

and it be you contention that
when the partner be make
aware of the lesion they
jump to the conclusion you have
and fired you

absolutely

do you have any lesion on you
face at this time

one
here in front of i ear

remembering you be under oath
answering truthfully can you
see the lesion on you face in
this mirror three foot away
answer truthfully

by the time i be fired there
be four lesion on i face
much big

no
i can not really see it

thank you

this would be a good time to
break for the day

you honor
may i have ten
minute in redirect

part of you body at this time
that resemble the lesion that

on i torso

if it please the court i would like
to ask mr
beckett to
remove he shirt so that the
jury can have an
idea
of what we be talking about

we object you honor
it would
unfairly influence the jury

you honor if mr
beckett be
forced by he illness to use a
wheelchair would the defense
ask he to park it outside
we be talking about we be
talking about lesion
let we
what we be talking about

i will allow it
would you mind
remove you shirt mr
beckett

allright

can you see the lesion on you
chest in this mirror

yes

thank you


i have discover something
interesting charles

keep they from that area
on ground of relevancy
what bob

no matter how hard i try i
can not lose a file in i
computer


the system automatically make a
backup

i do not think i should hear this

you can erase the backup
but
would you

what be the point bob

very interesting bob
let we make a
note of that
andy do not lose the
complaint in he computer
he
never put it in
he lie about
that too

charles

if you feel differently bob you
should say so when you be called
to the stand
after all this
be not a conspiracy


why do you recruit andrew beckett
to you firm

if you be the owner of a major
league ball club you recruit the
hot rookie
and andy be tremendously
promising as a young attorney
that be why we go after he
that be why we hired he and
that be why we stick with he
year after year
waiting for
the promise to be fulfilled
but
it never be

you keep giving he another chance

of course we do
when you have
groom someone they way we groom
andy nurturing he lavish all
kind of special treatment on he
you have make quite an investment
we be waiting for he promise to
kick in and deliver
but
ultimately we could no longer
ignore the gap between the promise
and the reality
this be one of
the sad time in i life
to
sit in this court testify to
Andys ultimate failure to make
the grade
to discover that he be
one of those people who want to
benefit by the system but do not
want to play by the system
rule
to think you
someone
only to find out
you do not know
they at all
it be heartbreaking

thank you
that be all for now
you honor

mr
miller

explain to i if you can mr
wheeler explain this to i like
i be a ten yearold
this trial be
not about a disease be that what
you be saying
about you
understandable if unfounded fear
of catching through casual
contact with someone who have it
you be saying this trial be about
andrew Becketts character
be i
get this right

yes character
to the extent that it
affect a persona ability to do
a great job


andy worked when he wanted to work
telling we what he think we
needed to know about his
lifestyle

i do not mind covering for andy
but i do wonder
when be he
planning to deal with he problem

sometimes it seem like society
be
by these kind of people

what kind of people

people who want to bend the rule

if you want to be a leader in this
society you have to make
certain sacrifice

to suit they personal desire
and the rest of we have to live
with it

you have to make a decision
be
this guy partner material

who make the rule mr
wheeler

yes i do see the lesion
i
suspected he be sick

the everyday common person with
decent value

it seem like he be not will to
face the
of he situation

i do not tell the other i
be afraid to

but now we be standing up for
ourselves

but we should not have fired
he

it be time to get this society
back on track

could you call an ambulance
please


it be making it bad
take it
out
take it out


if he be mediocre why do
they give he this major
assignment
before
they fired he

they be testing he


they wanted to see if he would rise
to the challenge

they wanted to give he a final
chance

make sense

i would still love to know what
happen to that miss file

would not we all

ask the computer

they say he be not competent
but
you hear he on the stand

he sound pretty smart to i

why would they fire he
why
not a medical leave or

they freak out over the

they hate homosexual

it be not against the law to
disapprove of homosexual

it
against the law to fire someone
for have
that be why we be
here

you be the foreman
you have not say
anything
what do you think

they be saying he be not a good
lawyer
he be mediocre
and the
fact that they give he the most
important lawsuit they would ever have
for one of they most important
client
they say that do not
prove anything because that be
just a test
what do they call
it
carrot
to see if he would rise
to the occasion
okay
say
i have get to send a pilot into
enemy territory and he be going to
be flying a plane that cost
million dollar
who be i going to put into that
plane
rookie who can not cut the
grade because i want to see if
he will rise to the challenge
or am
i going to give that assignment to
i good pilot i most experience
i sharpe i top gun
the very
best i have get


could somebody please explain that
to i
like i be a six year old

member of the jury have you
reach a verdict


we have you honor


we find for the plaintiff
andrew beckett

have you award any damage

yes we have you honor
for back pay and loss of benefit
one hundred fortythree
thousand dollar



for damage related to mental
anguish and humiliation
we give
no award
disappoint


and punitive damage we award
four million eight hundred and
eighty two thousand dollar


if he come out of the
hospital this time you must not
expect he to be like he be
before

ocean
