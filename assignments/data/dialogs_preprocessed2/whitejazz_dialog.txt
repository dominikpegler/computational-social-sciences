spartan space appointed with highticket item like the
mahogany table around which we sit
outside
echo of a
protest filter through the window






four of we at the table glue to the
watch you

attorney welles noonan lambast the



las version of the young turk
only mean




boyce bradley chief of detective
smart man in town
and one of
the rich
dad be a real estate
developer who owned a strip of land
that be now known as the santa
monica freeway
on either side
bradleys bookend


bob
gallaudet not the smart man in
town
gas chamber bob crib i
note at law
and tom Bethune
running for a city council seat
that decide if this mexican slum
called chavez ravine get bulldoze
and rename dodger stadium


turn it off

i be pissing
he be jumping

attorney noonan be accusing the
los angeles police department in
general and lt
david klein in
particular of murder at bad
gross incompetence at best


noonan have Sanderline scared
after
he sing to i he panicked jump

he do spend a month in Camarillo
mental hospital last year

and wearing that hotel robe over
he clothes make he look even
more looneybin

plus reuben ruiz recant
so
Noonans boxing probe be dead
he be
get nothing

but time a mandate and new
target
i need to speak to the
lieutenant alone


describe to i you duty as you
understood it regarding Sanderline
johnson and reuben ruiz

take both man into custody before
noonan and the feds could and find
out what they be going to tell

and why do i choose you for this

because i be a cop with a law
degree and you think i legal

because you a thug with a law
degree
because i think by now
you would be so indebted to this
department for not indict andor
imprison you that diligent
honest discharge of duty would be
assure
and i make a horrible misjudgment


Bethune and gallaudet do not think
so

bob happy because he want to be
state attorney general and he most
likely opponent will be welles
noonan
toms happy because morton
Diskant who be leading they city
council race be endorsed by
noonan
thus they be not seeing
the large play
Noonans new target will likely be
the itself

how do you know that


because that be where i would aim
a
subpoenaed federal witness plummet
to he death in the company of two
detective
this scream police corruption

this offer noonan the possibility
of payback in the form of national
headline

johnson do that stint at the nut
house leak he file to you
friend at the time

i friend would be more interest
in this
coroner preliminary
white paint
chip find embedded in Sanderline
johnsons scalp
match dent on
the white window sill
i checked
with the hotel switchboard and
find a call be patched to you
room at about the same time johnson
fly out of it
beat proclamation

it shock and sicken i that you
allegiance to the chicago mob would
take precedence over the

alright
where be this going

gun
shield
what

the appearance of disciplinary
measure taken against you be
mandated postSanderline johnson
so you suspension will be recorded
but seal
and keep quiet for now


so if the paper or noonan come
sniff around

we can provide adequate proof of
you dismissal

but you be not dismiss i

just on paper
since i misjudge the cop i think
you be i be going to leverage the
cop that you be

morton Diskant be to be remove
from the city council race
the
means and method implement to
that end i will entrust to you

you want i to torpedo Diskant so
you buddy Bethune can win a city
council seat uncontested

or spend the next month in lockup
before be arraign on charge
of gross misconduct and dereliction
of duty

face life in prison for murder

around we garden patch


i ass first fritz yours second

tommy magdalena have go to ground

Noonans deadline lapse ten
minute ago
an official fugitive
from justice now
down below bradley with reuben ruiz intow
glazedfear
following he like he be handcuff

continue







bradley do damage control the
force relocation of the ravine
immigrant have the press in a
feeding frenzy
reuben ruiz forced
along as the token mexican
mouthpiece

this area have long be rife with
crime and venality but with a
brand new stadium we can make this
horrible blight a bright spot and
give we los angeles dodgers the
home they deserve
reuben ruiz can tell you of he
travail growing up in this
horrible slum and why now be the
time to redeem the ravine


chief bradley you

attorney
noonan have promise to deliver
surprise witness before the
federal grand jury on

welles noonan be an unscrupulous
hack politician whose smear
campaign against we will fail for
he have grievously underestimated
the moral rectitude of the los
angeles police department

now if you will excuse i i will leave
you with reuben ruiz


you subpoena have not catch up to
i yet chief

hurwitz holding

you Bethune and gallaudet buy
big chunk of chavez ravine over
the past two year through a she will
company called hurwitz holding
if the dodgers move here the value
of the land boom
you could sell
it off for a fortune or hang
onto it and make even more
the
parking lots alone would make you
all multimillionaires

word get out that the three city
official who be pushing hardest
for a stadium also stand to gain a
mint might color public opinion
might color it even more to know
that the LAPDs chief of detective
be trying to purchase a huge tract
of that land from the big dope
dealer in town

hector magdalena owned ten and half
acre of this land
you do not give a shit about
solving he disappearance
you be
worry that you real estate deal
be going south


that be why you wanted tommy find
not because he be a murder suspect
or you be concern that noonan
might tap he as a federal
witness
you needed he to
finalize you fuck land grab
to
sign paperwork in place of he dead
dad
that be why you have get madge
and lucille in custody now
maybe i will let you subpoena find
i now chief maybe i will walk right

i have a feel
i
smell coverup all over Hectors
disappearance and Wilhite would not
have the muscle or the mindset to
kingpin something that big by
himself
you know about bradley
trying to buy he out

he be offering to exonerate hector
and clear he criminal record
hector meet with Wilhite and i to
inform we of he decision

and well
for the moment
speaking to koenig and Wilhite



to accept bradleys deal
koenig pet Hectors twin doberman guard dog



and although the term of that
deal worked well for he
i find
they less than favorable
koenig draw a silence pistol and shoot both dog before
shooting a shock hector twice in the chest
Wilhite
stagger to he foot as koenig step over and deliver the
coup de grace headshot to hector

dying to shoot he dead


you know about Wilhite and lucille
that be how you be operating he

i be aware of he sexual
predilection

and someone else

we share an eye for human frailty
and we be both born blackmailer
dave
i know young Stemmons here have a
fondness for lad stretching back
to he day at the academy

and now you be he only ally
this sad queer who fell out with
