keep coming here the works and
talk about i mummy and i daddy
and i will even pay for it but will
you kindly for god sake say

maybe this be not just a trick
maybe you be in danger of real
love real involve

i do not love he

you have spent you life avoiding
this
you will try hard to deny it
you be quite likely to destroy it


four five what numbered i
say

four ninetyseven jane mckenna

and i keep the authorization
please

i think there would be more



all right
loneliness
well separated
from other
people
forget
well as if i can be here i can go
through the motion right
but the
truth be i do not belong



do not belong



do you always have to repeat



sorry



well it be more than loneliness
hate
people hate i and
watch i and following and
waiting to hurt i you know
i be
all screw up



you think people hate you



the truth be i hate they
they must
hate i
all right the money
all right not the money
kind of
puton
it get thing back together
well let we say i would go to one of
these cattlecalls a tryout
i
mean before before i get this
job and they would always say thank
you very much and i would feel you
know bring down
they do not
want i



do not want you



i said that
well so you have a choice
you can
either feel lonely you know the
hate or
then more rapidly
plunge
so you take a call and go to a
hotel room and there be some john
you have never see before but he
want you
he must he be paying for
it
and usually they be nervous and
that be all right too because
you be not
you know this thing
and then for a while boy they
really pay attention you be all
there be
and it be not real and you do not
have to even like they you can
even hate they it be all right it
safe you know

all right there be tom Grunemann
you be right different margin
different space absolutely
sloppy right

mm

all right try this next guy

think this be we guy

i do not know
it look familiar to
i

think it might
it be off an
arrest report you type two year
ago
man you wanted sample of
everybody

now the next cat
mm

same margin top and side
he do
best with he middle finger
you
get faint registration from
outside key like and
like that
next thing look around
apostrophe how he hit the space
bar before

but what reason could he have
what
possible reason

unless he be involved with
Grunemanns disappearance

i know tom never write that letter

what else do you know

i never could believe that tom be
a split personality
i never
believe he be a dumper
and i
do not believe he disappeared of he
own volition
and i do not believe
he be alive

we have some very tentative
circumstantial evidence of freeky
behavior but there be no evidence
of murder there be not even a
body

i do not believe toms alive

but why
why

yes mr
cable office please

john how be you

i will be sending you on a report
tonight

it be a beautiful day in Tuscarora
i do not envy you that humidity in
the city

it be not so bad

would you like to know what be in
it
the report

what be in it

i think tom Grunemanns dead
i have
be a lot of place i have ask a
lot of people
i have find no proof
he be around
i have find no proof he
be ever around

how do you go from that to the idea
toms dead
suicide you be
suggest
he killed himself

he could have be murdered

i be sure the and the police
explored that possibility

no
they never do really
but
that be what i be going to recommend
the next step
unless something

have you discuss this with they

it be in the report

do they have the report
have you
discuss it with they

i wanted to give it to you first

all right
all right

over right

go down in i room and wait

but if cable killed Grunemann why
would he get you hire to look for
Grunemann

because he know i could not leave
the case alone
and this way at
least he would keep track of it
and
i

what about Grunemanns letter to
the girl everything like that

cable letter cable phone
call
cable everything else
he be be a dumper a long time

just passed off he own peculiar
habit on the other man it keep
thing going

pretend i believe you
