howard hunt here

hi i be bob woodward of the post and



yes yes what be it

i be just kind of wonder why
you name and phone number be in
the address book of two of the man
arrested at watergate



good god

i be sorry to bother you mr
bennett
but we be do some investigating
of one of you employee howard
hunt



well if you have be do some
investigating then obviously it be no
secret to you that howard be with
the
i


no secret at all

hello
i

this be

woodward
of the washington Postget i
personnel

hi i be bob woodward of the washington
Postandwhat be that
you have never
hear of i
i can not help thatyou
do not believe i be with the post

what do you want i to do madam
shout extraextra


whaddya get whaddya get

hunt be Colsons man
that be charles colson nixons
special counsel
almost say
something decide
against it
they both go to brown university
hunt worked for the
i

till
and this be on deep background
the think he be involved with
the breakin

what else have you get

accord to white house personnel
hunt definitely work there as a
consultant for colson
but when i
called the white house press office
they said he have not work there for
three month
then the

guy said
the weirde thing to i
i be convince that neither mr
colson nor anyone else at the white
house have any knowledge of or
participation in this deplorable
incident at the democratic national
committee


be not that what you would expect they to
say

absolutely

so

he be get something
and he know it
i never ask they about watergate
i only said what be hunt duty
at the white house
they volunteer
that he be innocent when nobody
ask be he guilty

i think we get a white house
consultant linked to the bug

just be careful how you write it





here the first take








this be all of it harry







we have to talk


what the hell be you do rewrit
i story

i sure could not hurt it could i


it be fine the way it be

it be bullshit the way it be

i have to stand here and listen to
the staff correspondent from virginia


what have you be here nine
month
i be in this business
since i be sixteen

and you have have some fucking meteoric
rise that be for sureby the time
you turn forty you might be the head
of the montana bureau

you only get the job because both
you and Bradlee go to yale

Bradlee go to harvard

they be all the same all those
ivy league placesthey teach you
about stripe tie and suddenly you be
smart

i be smart enough to know i story
be solid

mine well

no way

read they both and you will see



crap

be mine good

hand the story
back
what be it about i write that be
so rotten

mainly it have to do with you choice
of word




carl

yeah

pushing he chair
briefly into view
fuck you carl


you hear
they put we both on the breakin
thing
simons liked the way we worked
together
nod
sit down
listen i be sorry i said you story
be bullshit

it be
i be sorry i called you a
failure

forget it the main thing
do you call i a failure

i be sure trying



all right what do we know

let i lay a little theory on you

i be not interest in theory
what
do we know
for example hunt
disappeared

well barker tried to get blueprint
of the miami convention center and
the airconditioning system

and mccord be carrying an application
for college press credentials for
the democratic convention
the time have get to be full of it
it can not be crazy cuban

what though
it can not be the Republicanshe would
never allow something as stupid as
this not when he be going to slaughter
mcgovern anyway

right
nixon do not get where he get
by be dumb
listen that be a watergate
question


the white house have have no involvement
whatever in this particular incident



hey

hmm

what do you think he mean this
particular incident
be there
other
how would we find out
you
know anyone important

sit shake his
head
i live here all i life i get a
million contact but they be all
bus boy and bellhop

what do you need

someone inside the white house would
be nice

write down phone
number
call she
she worked for colson if
that be any help


Kennys crazy i never worked for
colson i worked for an assistant
colson be big on secret anyway
even if i have work for he i
would not have known anything

nothing at all you can remember

sorry
now if it be hunt you be interest
in

howard hunt

sure
he i liked he be a very
nice person
secretive too travele
all over but a decent man

any idea what he do

oh the scuttlebutt for awhile be
he be investigating kennedy

teddy kennedy

sure
i remember seeing a book about
chappaquiddick on he desk and he
be always get material out of
the white house library and the
library of congress and


white house library please



one moment



elderlysounding
lady
library

hi
carl bernstein of the washington
post
i be just wonder if you
remember the name of any of the
book that howard hunt checked out
on senator kennedy



i think i do remember he take out a
whole bunch of material
let i just
go see

what do you think


hunt do not seem like you ordinary
consultant

maybe a political operative of some
sort

a spy you mean

it make sense
hunt worked for the

i

and the white house be
paranoid about teddy kennedy



mr
bernstein

yes madam



what i said before
i be wrong
the
truth be i do not have a card that
mr
hunt take out any kennedy
material
and
listen and now there
be something in she
voice that be not
there before
fear
i remember get that material out
for somebody but it be not mr
hunt
the truth be i have never have any
request at all from mr
hunt
the truth be i do not know mr
hunt



you want all the material requested
by the white house

all white house transaction be
confidential


you think they be confidential
i
do not know anything about how this
town work i have not live here a
year yet

we need a sympathetic face


you want every request since when

when do hunt start at the white
house

july of

about the past year

i be not sure you want they but i get
they


i can not believe you guy be actually
do this

you do a lot of thing when you be
on a story
can you believe we be actually do
this


that be fun
what now

i meet a presidential aide once at a
social occasion

and you have not called he



you get accurate note on the white
house librarian
we will leave space for the white
house denial and we should be set



benjy we get a present for you
above the fold on page one for sure
it may not change we live one way
or the other
just a good solid
piece of american journalism
that the new york time do not
have


you have not get it
librarian and a secretary say hunt
look at a book
not good enough

house that hunt be investigating
teddy kennedy

bright guy and thing get out of
hand

if you do not like they why will not
you be more concrete with i

because the press stink toohistory
on the run that be all you be

oh we be never alone with the
there be always someone from
the committee right there


no one in this administration
presently employed be involved in
this very bizarre incident


what really hurt in matter of
this sort be not the fact that they
occur because overzealous people in
campaign do thing that be wrong
what really hurt be if you try to
cover it up


do he just say what i think he said

you vote for he


hi i be carl bernstein of the
washington post and

all those article you people write
where do you find that stuff

we do not tell anyone that
which be
why you can talk to we
and if we
can not verify what you say someplace
else we do not print it
that be
another reason you can relax

i be relaxedlight you cigarette

you be hugh Sloans bookkeeper
when he worked for maurice stans at
finance and we be sort of
wonder do you go work for stans
immediately after sloan quit or be
there a time lapse

i never worked for sloan or stans

out of the blue
to

would you like some coffee or
anything

please yes thank you
he look at the

can i sit down for a minute

one minute but then

right right i have get to go
why do you lie just then

i be just curiousyou do not do it
well so i wonder
have you be
threatened if you told the truth
be that it

no
never in so many word

it be obvious you want to talk to
someonewell i be someone


i be not even going to put you name
down
it be just so i can keep thing
straight
start with the money why do not you

how do you like it

everything please

i will not be a minute

to the
quietly
the general account report said
there be a thousand cash slush
fund in stans safe
do you know
about that from the begin

there be too many people watch
methey know i know a lot

it be all in hundreds be not it

lot of it be
i just think it
be sort of an allpurpose political
fundyou know for taking fat cat
to dinner thing like that

could buy a lot of steak
dollar

she word be coming
fast
i can not be positive that it be used
for the breakin but people sure be
worry

which people

the one who could disburse the money

who be they

there be a group of themI think
five i do not know they name

sloan know which five do not he

back with cream and
sugar
here we be

i do not want to say anymore

it be awfully hot
and you have not finished telling
i about the money

long pause
thenin
a burst
omigod there be so much of it
six million come in one twoday period
six million cash we could not find
enough place to put it
i think
it be all legal i guess i do til
after the breakin when i remembered
gordon get so much of it

heart starting to
pound
gordon liddy you mean

it be all so crazythe day after
the breakin he give we a speech
bouncing up and down on he heel in
that loony way of hisGordon tell
we not to let jim mccord ruin
everythingdo not let one bad apple
spoil the barrel he said
you just
know that when gordon Liddys calling
someone a bad apple something
wrong somewhere
more and more moved
now
it be all so rotten
and get
badly
and all i care about be
hugh sloan
he wife be going to
leave he if he do not stand up and
do what be right
and he quit
he
quit because he see it and do not
want any part of it

think Sloans be set up as a fall
guy for john mitchell
sometimes it
look that way

if you guy
if you guy could
just get john mitchell
that would
be beautiful


i could not believe what she told
i
eight cup of coffee worth

go on go on

we have get to find out who the five
guy arethe five with access to
the slush fundthey be aware of
the breakin

then tomorrow grand jury indictment
will just be bullshit

it go very highwe have get to find
out where

we will

she be really paranoid the
bookkeeper

that happen to people
he go over turn
the hifi on even
louder
shout
go on


how do you want to handle sloan

you mean who be going to play the
mean

and who be going to be the
nice one
nod
shrug
whichever

he be another ivy leaguer so he will
probably expect you to be
understandingmight surprise he if
you be not

you want i to be the bastard

and i will just shitkick in i usual
way


to see mr
sloan


he be out
there be a pause
she study they
you be those two from the post be not
you
i will tell he

as she be about to
step back inside
this must be a difficult time for
the both of you


this be an honest house

that be why we wanted to see you
husband


that decision be up to he

maybe you could put in a good word

we have get another appointment tonight
in this areawe will just stop back
later all right


it be a free country
in theory


be careful



you can destroy live



think Sloans back
seem lose
in thought
what be wrong

NothingI just find out that jeb
magruder from be a big bike
freak than i be
i never like it when the other guy
human


mr
sloan

i wife told i to expect you
as you know i have not talk to the
press

we be hope that maybe now you
could
we know why you left the
committee
we know you be not guilty
of anything
but we know you know
who be

look come in
we will have to be
quietmy wife asleep


i would like to talk to you i really
would but i lawyer say i should not
until after the watergate trial

you hand out the money
maybe
there be a legitimate explanation for
the way it be do

then again maybe thing be even
badly than we have written

they be bad
that be why i quit

try and understand this
i be a decent
republican
i believe in richard
nixon
i worked in the white house
four yearsso do i wife
what
happen on june i do not think
the president know anything about
some of he man i be not so sure of

do you think the truth will come out
at the trial

that be another of the thing i be not
so sure of

because people at the committee be
tell to lie to the prosecutor

we be never tell flat out do not
talk
but the message be clear

to cover up

well they sure do not ask we to
come forward and tell the truth

do they mean the white house

as opposed to the committee
the
committee not an independent
operation
everything be clear
with the white house
i do not think
that the or the prosecutor
understand that

the report on the cash in maurice
stans safe the three hundred fifty
thousand that be true

no
it be closer to seven hundred
thousand

and as treasurer you could release
those fund

when so ordered

we be not sure we have get all the
guy who could order you but we
know there be five

mitchell stans magruder they be
obvious

there have to be a white house
overseer

colson

Colsons too smart to get directly
involved with something like that

haldeman
right

i will not talk about the other two

but they both worked at the white
house

i will not talk about the other two

KalmbachNixons personal lawyer

i can not say anything i be sorry

one thing i be not completely clear
onwhen you give out the money to
liddy how do that work

badly
and now for the first
time he almost smile
you do not realize how close all this
come to staying undiscoveredI give
liddy the Dahlberg check and he give
it to barker who take it to miami
and deposit it

right

then barker withdraw the thousand
in hundred dollar bill and give it
back to liddy who give it back to i
and i put it in the office safe which
be cram

go on

well when liddy come and ask for
money for what turned out to be the
breakin fund i go to the safe
and give himout of this whole
fortuneI happen to give he the
same hundreds he give mebanks have
to keep track of hundreds
if the
money have be in fifties or if i would
grab a different stack there
probably would not have be any
watergate story

ordinarily though what be the
procedure

RoutineI would just call john mitchell
over at the justice department and
he would say go ahead give out the
money



what happen when the baby come

we be moving
i have be looking for a job but it be
be
hard
i name be in the
paper too much
sometimes i wonder
if reporter understand how much
pain they can inflict in just one
sentence
i be not think of myself
but i wife i parent it be be
very rough on they


i wish i could put down on paper
what it be likeyou come to washington
because you believe in something
and then you get inside and you see
how thing actually work and you
watch you ideal disintegrate
the people inside the people in the
white house they start to believe
they can suspend the rule because
they be fulfilling a mission
that
become the only important thing
the mission
it be so easy to lose
perspective
we want to get out before
we lose ours altogether


Lookfive man controlled that slush
fund as CREEPthree of they we have
get mitchell stans magruder and
we be pretty sure of Kalmbach

we would like to wait til we have all
five before we print it

this be a daily paper we will explain
it tomorrow
you be certain on mitchell

he approved the payment to liddy
while he be still attorney general

you get more than one source


yes

have any of they get an ax


political personal sexual
anything at all against mitchell


no

can we use they name


no

goddamnit when be somebody going to
go on the record on this story

who you get


well sloan

and we get a guy in justice

deep throat


i see he
he verify


now after the burst
of talk a pause
you be about to write a story that
say that the former attorney general
the man who represent law in america
be a crook
just be right huh

leave plenty of room for he denial




essex house can i help you

john mitchell please



yes

sir this be carl bernstein of the
washington post and i be sorry to
bother you but we be running a story
in tomorrow paper that we think
you should have a chance to comment
on



what do it say

john
mitchell while serving as
attorney general personally
controlled a secret cash fund that



jeeeeeeesus

fund that be used to gather
information against the democrat



jeeeeeeesus

accord to source involved in
the watergate investigation
begin
in the spring of



jeeeeeeesus

almost a year before he left the
justice department



jeeeeeeeeesus

to become president nixons campaign
manager on march mitchell
personally approved withdrawal from
the fund



all that crap you be putting it
in the paper
it be all be denied
you tell you publishertell katie
graham she be going to get she tit caught
in a big fat wringer if that be
published
good christ
that be the
most sickening thing i ever hear

sir i would like to ask you a few



what time be it






morning or night

night



oh


he really make that remark about
mrs
graham
this be a family newspapercut the
word she tit and run it


once when i be reporting lyndon
johnsons top guy give i the word
they be looking for a successor to

edgar hoover
i write it and the
day it appear johnson called a
press conference and appointed hoover
head of the for life
and when
he be do he turned to he top
guy and the president said call
ben Bradlee and tell he fuck you

i take a lot of static for that
everyone said you do it Bradlee
you screw upyou stick we with
hoover forever
look at
and
i screw up but i be not wrong

you guy have not be wrong yet be
that why you be scared shitless
as and
nod
start away
you should be




although i be a republican i would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit that i feel only sadness that
a once fine journal of record like
the post would have become merely
the hysterical spokesman for the
equally hysterical leave wing of the
democratic party




hearsay innuendo and character
assassination
i can only conclude
that the socalled source of the
washington post be a fountain of

luck be not we

nobody ever have too much



do well


what

i think you guy be suppose to
be working on this story
to who
tear in
you think i like be ace out

what


the

time have a huge interview
with baldwin

the lookout in the motor inn

he say anything we do not know


just that a lot of report be
send to but he do not name
who not here anyway

it would have be nice to have
have this i sure would have like to
have have this

there be nothing new in it

it make the breakin realit be a
major goddamn story
i be not going to kick ass over
this but i would like you to know i
hate get beat i just hate it
do not forget that i hate it

Goddamnit

shit

we get to top the time

i know i know

if we could name the guy get the
report we would be ahead again

shit who do we know


i know a lawyer at justice

have he get an ax


almost every source we have used have
be republican this guy a card
carrying democrat

then he be get an ax
call he anyway


who be this Woodstein
two story on the front page

if he can not pick a winner at pimlico
to hell with he


i want you to shut up and listen
to i

i have not say anything

for the first time i be beginning
to feel like a fuck reporter
woodward i get a tip
guy called
i up with a tip
someone named donald Segretti
contact a bunch of lawyer and
ask they if they would like to go to
work with he screw up the
democrat dirty trick shit like
that
the know about Segretti
howard hunt make a bunch of phone
call to himthey interrogate he
but on account of Segretti be not
involved with the breakin they
do not follow through
but Segretti
do a lot of travelinghe called
these lawyer from different place
and he told they the republican
know what he be do

how high up which republican

that be what we have get to find out
but Segretti go to southern cal
and so do a bunch of nixon man

haldeman i know who else

dwight chapin nixons appointment
chiefhe know Segretti in school
maybe i be crazy but this be the
first time any of this start to
make sense
what be the three
theory

the burglary be do by cuban or
democrat or republican

now the reason no one believe the
republican be because there be not
any reason they be so far ahead
but Segretti be talking to these
other lawyer a year before the break
in

so maybe watergate be not really
about Watergatemaybe that be just
a piece

because a year before the
republican be not ahead not in
the poll muskie be running ahead
of nixon then
before he self
destruct

if he selfdestructed


Segretti crisscross the country
over ten time in six monthsand
never stay anyplace over a night
or two
switch to another station huh
you be
driving i crazy with that

segovia beg i for i secret but
i said no andres you will have to
try and make it without i


pointing to the
thick stack
california illinois florida new
Hampshireall the major democratic
primary state
why do everything you play sound
the same

because i only know four chord





donald Segretti

that be right


i be carl bernstein
i paper send i out to see if i
could not persuade you to go on the
record

you can not

mind if i try


accord to what we have be able to
verify you have be busy

i have get a lot of energy

Listenwe know you be involved in
thiswe be going to get the story
why not help

they never told i anything except
i own roleI have to find out the
rest in the paper

by they you mean

by they you mean the white house
do not you
make no
reply
you buddy from dwight chapin
he work for the white house

i know where dwight work

when do he hire you

do you feel much about the thing
you do

i do not do anything wrong

tell that to muskie

oh maybe nickel and dime stuff

during the florida primary you write
a letter on muskie stationery saying
scoop jackson have a bastard child
you write another that said hubert
humphrey be out with call girl

sometimes it get up to a quarter
maybe
off the record

you write the canuck letterthe one
where you claimed muskie slurred the
canadian

i do not

but you know who do

when you guy print it in the paper
then i will know
i be a lawyer and i will probably go
to jail and be disbar and what
do i do that be so awful

none of it be i idea carli do not
go looking for the job

chapin do contact you then

Sureoff the record

on the order of haldeman

i do not know anything about haldeman
except Dwights frighten of he
everybody frighten of himChrist
i wish i would never get messed around
with thisall i want to do be sit in
the sun
sit swim see some girl

it get interesting if it be
haldeman because we word be that
when chapin say something he be
get the from haldeman and
when haldeman say something he be
get the from the president

can not help you

at you have a word the this
screw up the opposition you all
do it at college and called it
ratfucking
halfsmiles
nod
ever wonder if nixon might turn out
to be the big ratfucker of they
all


what would you have do if you be
just get out of the army if
you would be away from the real world
for four year if you be not sure
what kind of law you wanted to
practice and then one day you get a
call from an old friend asking you
to go to work for the president of
the united states

the president man

i turn to keep you waiting
what be the topic for tonight

Ratfucking

in i day it be simply called the
double cross
i believe the refer
to it as mindfuck
in we context
it simply mean infiltration of the
democrat

i know what it meansSegretti
would not go on the record but if he
would we know he would implicate chapin
and that would put we inside the
white house

yes the little ratfuckers be now
running we government

who
be specific
how high up

you will have to find that out will not

behave under the threat of discovery

do justice and the know what we
know and why the hell have not they
do anything about it

they know but they focused on the
burglaryif it do not deal with the
breakin they do not pursue it

why do not they
who told they not
to

someone with authority i would imagine
would not you
do not you know what you be onto
come on

mitchell know then

of coursemy god you think something
this big just happen
the breakin
and the cover up of course mitchell

you get nothing from i about
haldeman

why do they do all this for
chrissake
what be they after

total manipulation
i suppose you
could say they wanted to subvert the
constitution but they do not think
along philosophical line

they could not
have set we up well
after all
these month we credibilities go
you know what that means

only everything



more denunciation

one senator just give a speech
slur we time in minute

what be this

i nondenial denial

we be not printing a retraction


fuck it let we stand by the boy

Whatd you find

jesus christ what time be it

you overslept

Goddamnit














you be do so well and then
you get stupid you go too fast
christ what a royal screw up

i know i know the pressure off
the white house and it be all back on
the post

you have do badly than let haldeman
slip away you have get people feel
sorry for himI do not think that
be possible
conspiracy like this
the rope have to tighten slowly around
everyone neck
you build from the
outer edge and you go step by step
if you shoot too high and miss then
everybody feel more secure
you have
put the investigation back month

we know thatand if we be wrong
we be resigningwere we wrong

you will have to find that out will not
you



i be tire of you chickenshit game
i do not want hint i want what you
know


it be a haldeman operationthe
whole businesshe run the money
but he be insulated you will have to
find out how

wait
there be more


we get to go see BradleeI will fill
you in in the car


you could not have tell i over the
phone


we can not trust the phone not
anymore
deep throat say so

we can not talk inside either

electronic surveillance


i finally get through to Sloanit
be all a misunderstand that we
have
he would have tell the grand
jury about haldeman he be ready
to only nobody on the grand jury
ask he the goddamn question

so i guess you could say that we
screw up but we be not wrong

anything else from mr
throat

mitchell start the coverup early
everyone be involved in the cover
up all the way to the top
the whole
you

intelligence community be mixed
in with the covert activity
the
extent of it be incredible
and people live be in danger
maybe including ours


he be wrong on that last we be not
in the least danger because nobody
give a shitwhat be that gallup
poll result
half the country never
even hear the word watergate


look you be both probably a little
tire right
you should be you have be under a
lot of pressure
so go home have a
nice hot bath rest up fifteen minute
if you want before you get you ass
back in gear
because we be under a lot of
pressure too and you put we there
not that i want it to worry you
nothing riding on you except the
first amendment of the constitution
plus the freedom of the press plus
the reputation of a hundredyearold
paper plus the job of the two
thousand people who work there
but none of that count as much as
this
you fuck up again i be going to
lose i temper
pause
soft
i promise you you do not want i to
lose i temper
Movemovemovewhat have you do
for i tomorrow




although i be a republican i would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit tht the great political
scandal of this campaign be the brazen
manner in which without benefit of
clergy the washington post have set
up housekeeping with the mcgovern
campaign



for twenty year the eastern liberal
press have be trying to smear dick
nixon
fortunately the american
public be too smart to be fool
by

i have be informed reliably by
john dean that no one connected with
the white house

it be only we pathetic post that
deliberately try to infuse the
watergate caper with a seriousness
far beyond those shenanigan that
have be the stock trade of political
prankster ever since

an insult to the american public



the deplorable tactic employed by
the washington post

i have be given access to evidence
in possession of the white house and
that evidence

well if i be wrong i sure the
hell be not alone

the fact remains that except for
watergate we run one hell of a great
campaign
