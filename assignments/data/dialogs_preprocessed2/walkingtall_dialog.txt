chris

guess that change we relationship
a bit huh

you should have come looking for
trouble
keep you hand up get out
of the vehicle now chris


i advise you to give this offer more
than a little serious thought
if you
go to trial you stand to do year
this be a sweet plea normally they
would not even put it on the table but
you military record can not be ignore
three month home arrest some community
service
pretty generous offer chris

but i would have to plead guilty

look at it from the other side
there be
over a dozen witness none of em be
going to paint a very flatter picture

he start bustin up the machine

there be a gunshot

go crazy

complete psychopath

they be only offering i this deal just
to keep i quiet

well i still say you should take it

i be not wrong
and i will not say i be

we job be to keep order
but there
be no chance of that
i and i man
we be just tryin to control he
he
be highly trained violent very dangerous
person

so dangerous so violent so highly
trained that he despatch six of the
casino staff single handedly
he weapon
of choice a simple piece of cedar
which
in he hand become a devastate force
with one aim to hurt people destroy
property

he go directly for everything
he
just come in and take over the place

you said he broke you arm

yea that be correct i right forearm
both bone with a single shot
it be
crazy

you know toss out a coupla drunk now
and then
guy try to grope the girl
but ah nothing with this sort of violence

do he give you any kind of advance
warn
chance to defend yourself

we tussle but he be a big guy
he be
on a mission
besides he seem to
be too busy enjoy himself from what
i could see

so from what you see it seem like
he have some kinda purpose

i think he have a point to prove yeah

i be emptyin machine when mr Vaugh
come in and start swingin

i be tryin to get outta there

by legal counsel you realise that you
can not then claim a mistrial on that
basis

yes i do

very well mr vaughn

i do not deny anything that be say
here today

do that mean you be changing you
plea to guilty

i be not guilty of anything
except standing
up for myself when the law would not

objection
he be trying to introduce
prior event you honor

sustained
mr vaughn stay on point

i grow up in this town
people used
to walk tall in this town they would not
have trade the mill for a crook casino

civic speech

and they would not have stand around
while drug be be sell to kid

objection

sustained
mr vaughn you be close to
be hold in contempt

i be justified in what i do and if
you acquit i of these charge i be going to
run for sheriff
and if elected i be
going to fix this town

order order
mr vaughn you be now
charged with contempt

and i will make sure that he open
