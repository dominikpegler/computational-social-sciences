dawn with she rosered finger rise over a dusty country
road
car chug over the horizon

as far as con man story go
i think i have hear they all
of grifter ropers faro fixer
tale draw long and tall
but if one bear a bookmark in
the confidence mane tome
twould be that of penelope
and of the brother bloom


the car deposit two shabby boy in front of a
country house
both in black
each with a suitcase

at ten and thirteen bloom and
stephen


the two brother and an oafish sit eating
breakfast

have be through several foster
family
the slap bloom upside the head
stephen
across the table tackling the dad and beating the
crap out of he

thirty eight all tell



bloom stamped on it
it open and dozens of report flip
by
under the field we catch
different entry






mischief moved they on in life and
move keep they close


the brother on the porch suitcase in hand

for bloom have stephen stephen
bloom and both have more than most
the front door open and a pair of eye the
brother suspiciously


wide dusty main street which the two brother survey

another home another main street
stephen look around
then sum the burgh up thusly

bloom we have hit a one hat town

one theater
one car wash
one
cafe
one park
one cat
which
through some mishap have one leg
the cat sit on a roller skate row itself down the street
with it one leg

sweet jesus
look at that


group of child flee the school joyfully

one school which mean one tight
knit group of local welloff kid




they pocketchange buy rocket
pop



the brother

pixie stix



they be the they
all well
loved rooted happy as you please

always there
in every town

the playground bourgeoisy






could he simply



talk to she

just drop he fear and go
leave
he brother in the wood and join
the child

no



what be do

what




you shuffle when you be think
something through
so whatcha
think

not a thing

this be not really true
because in the root of stephens
psyche something now begin
seed of grand epiphany
hook
tale



plan

fiction make for profit in which
both boy play a part
simple con in fifteen step

and this be where we start



and then as if a curtain have be
pulled back from the sky
some barrier within the young
bloom be broken




hi

so bloom perform he role in
stephens story to a



and be who he be not could be
as he wished to be














oh kay
how be it going on the
playground front

it be great

so on to step eleven then
the
tale
you tell they

wait

must the number rattle on
must
the fiction end

i think i need more time to win
they

bloom
they be not you friend
they be part of this and this be not
real
remember it be a con
and when it be do we have just get
we
and we will be moving on
so the tale
you tell they
there be a




hermit in the wood
one eyed
steel toothed vagabond



with blood red eye

that be good
he stopped you coming
home from school



and told i of a cave

what kind of cave

cave of wonder

Pffft ha

shut up dave

at noon on every sunday there
appear a ball of light which
flutter like a butterfly

willowhisp

that be right
it guide you




if you can keep up



to where the treasure lay

so where be this cave

yeah where



Ahhah
the hermit do not say
he get this greedy glint look
the filthy redeyed leech
and
said he would tell for thirty buck



well that be just two buck each

so sunday come






and straight from church into
the wood bloom lead



they stopped
they heart leap
there it be



just like the hermit said






for just one moment bloom forget
himself and run too fast

he would catch the light and find the
treasure

but the moment passed



they do not catch the willowisp
but do not really care

it seem to i that in the end the
perfect con be where
each one involve get just the
thing they wanted

yeah i guess so

we fledgling thief be
satisfy




the child parent less so



bitter end
maybe
but
there be sweetness in the mix

the brother bloom have find they
calling

as show in number six

cut mean to negotiate percent
percentage deal




OHenrys be the town one dry
clean shop



so how be it feel

in truth young bloom will not know
for twenty year just how he feel

and so we will skip ahead now in we
story

let em melt

money i get the girl

because the turk be right
after
seeing she after that night on the
airstrip after cairo everything
changed and he could not see the
play through that one milky eye
but the turk be right about one
thing that there be nothing
beautiful about money

beautiful

this be not happening

he will never have she now

it will work on someone
and then
it will be the good card trick in the
world

suit



he even phonetically matched i
final word to hers

everything he want



that be what he do he write his
con the way dead russian write
novel with thematic arc and
imbed symbolism and shit

prospect of redemption and rebirth
seriously stephen
amateur night




i be not saying yes
but what be the
con

it be actually pretty simple
we be
brother antique dealer peruse
the americas for antiquity en
route to someplace exciting via
luxury steamer say greece
you
tie into she and work you magic



and so that be how it end in
mexico a burst of violence then a
moment of truth on the beach
what
do you think

you have get something up you
sleeve
this be about i right
somehow

this might not be something you
know but they have all be about
you
maybe that be why they have none
of they be perfect i have never
be able to give you what you
really want




i want to be outta all this

definition this be not going to
give i what i want

this will be the last one
you will
let i go

i will never approach you to do
another con again
let we make it a red Schwinn



there be less painful way to cut
into a mark

Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk
score to beat be

keep you
head in the game the chinese judge
be tough

this be a banana seat man

do not give i that blank look you
know what a fuckin banana seat be









there be actually a knack to this
you want to avoid dying or breaking
anything that will not grow back but
you do not want to roll out of it
and come up rose
if you be
trying to fast track into a mark
sympathy there be nothing quite
as efficient as have you first
conversation be from a hospital bed
they put you in
i usually like to
try for a dislocated shoulder






be you alright



the chink have it i be telling he
i know thank you in she report
i missed it
this be actually kind
of great i will tell you why

you missed it

dostoevsky be an epileptic

i know

he seizure be precede by an
enlighten euphoria a sort of
open of he spiritual eye




i think the fact that she see you
face the instant before a seizure
be a pretty goddamn good foot to
start thing out on right





the next step be to figure out a
way to insinuate yourself into
they personal life

i think they take i car
could
you drive i home

uh
yeah

i be penelope stamp

bloom





engagement
find a connection with
you mark through conversation

i be sorry about you lamborghini

ok




nice area
jersey

this car be like riding in a huge
marshmallow



have now deftly set you hook in
the mark psyche this would be
the perfect time to tug the line





get invited in for coffee and tell
they the full tale

for the bike and the whole thing
this be a big shit sandwich
ok
bye



however there be advantage to
playing it cool
letting it lie
for a day or two then casually re
establish contact




i realized
i should have
invited you in
for coffee

dealer who be finding and
selling we the antique coming from
exotic country all over the
world and there be a almost a
scent they have when they would come in
the dusty shop we worked nine to
five in since we be nineteen the
air would like before a rain the
ion would line up and you could
just smell midnight train to paris
and steamer ship and calcutta

here this way



penelope this be i brother
stephen

pleased to make you acquaintance
bloom told i about you you be
the epileptic photographer

i be writing in a bar
and she
do not drink how do she know a
philly beer

she know a lot of stuff
be that who i think it be on
the east deck this morning

yes it be
do he spot you

not yet



you look very nice




what be you childhood like

i make camera out of watermelon

lonely

lucky guess

how be it lonely

fishing for an entertain
childhood anecdote that
encapsulate i adult issue

well it be funny how everyone
usually get one

when i turned six i start get
allergy hayfever rash really
bad
so i mom take i into the
doctor and he do that test where
they use needle to prick a grid on
you back with all the different
toxin to see which one you be
allergic to
the next day i come
in the doctor lift up i shirt
and i back look like a patch of
oily moldy blackish green double
puff marshmallow
i be allergic
to everything
so they sealed the
house with plastic and a special
ventilation system and i spent i
entire childhood and adolescence
indoors
mostly alone
lonely




wow

it be not til i be nineteen they
discovered what i be actually
allergic to be the aluminum alloy
the hypodermic needle be make out
of
then i be going to leave but
i mom get sick
so i stay
and
she stay sick a long time

do you feel cheated

the trick to not feeling cheated be
to learn how to cheat
so i
decided this be not a story about a
miserable girl trapped in a house
that smell like medical supply
wasting she life on a die person
she sometimes hated
it be about
a girl who could find infinite
beauty in anything any little
thing
and do anything she decided
to do
and love the person she be
trapped with
so i told myself
that story until it become true
now do doing that let i escape a
waste life or do it just blind
i so i would not want to escape it
i do not know
but either way i
be the one telling i own story
so i do not feel cheated

and a magician be just an actor
playing the part of a magician
i
compliment




who be that man
you avoid he
early on the deck

i do not know but he be carrying a
knife up he sleeve and wearing a
cape
do i a favor and steer
clear of he

i do not suppose in all you hobby
acquire you ever learned how to
dance

i go through a phase when i be
mildly obsess with the bolero

give i a minute

mademoiselle

monsieur

i do not mean to startle you

yes you do




apology but the deck be dark
and i have to approach
it be be such a time since i have
encounter the brother bloom

you be in antique

unframed oil on canvas of a lonely stone well in a primeval
forest clear
it sit at the foot of an unmade bed




from a private collection on the
island of Ikaria
that one

who painted it

i do not know

why be it the last thing you see
every night and the first thing
you see every morning

that be a story
you have a minute
he close the blind and sit on a stool in front of the
paint
setting the stage

i daughter travel with i when
she be very young and i would show
she the place and the art all the
most joyous and terrifying thing
in the world
memory of he daughter hand in he flashing against the
sun

i wanted that the world be alive
in the most fantastic way for she
to build she a pair of wing
make
these thing real
but maybe more
than any other objet art she
loved to hear she would ask to hear the
story of the stone golem
from a
paint in a small private
collection on the island of Ikaria
he motion to the paint and we move into it
as he tell
the story the scene be show in the paint just as still
image which we move across like a picture book

well rachel like most monster the
golem be once a human
boy
about you age




and one day the boy be walking
home and he quarrel he fight
with a good friend of he
they
get very angry and he friend
push he a certain way and the
boy fell and strike he head and
die
the boyo friend be very
sad but also very frighten
so
instead of telling the boyo
parent he do something awful
he pulled the body into a quarry a
pit of break rock and hide the
boy beneath a pile of large stone
well
year go by and the boyo
friend become a young man and one
day while drink in town which
in he guilt he do quite a lot of
he hear that a well be be
build near the forest
with the
stone from the quarry
he run to
the quarry to find it nearly
empty
no stone no body
he
run to the well where the mason
be finishing they work
do
they find anything strange in the
quarry
he ask expect maybe
hope they would arrest he for the
awful crime on the spot
but no
they said motion to the well
nothing strange
just stone
they left he alone there at the
well and he stand looking into it
as the sun fell behind the
mountain and twilight set the
world in a deep still silence
the last image we land on be the well alone in the clear
it dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
that follow
then with a pierce a live monster of stone lunge
out of the well animate and terrifying grab the friend by
the throat and with a crunching of bone and one last roar
pull he back down into the depth of the well
silence again
we pull out of the paint back to the
curator sitting very still

i daughter die nineteen year ago
today
she be six
she go out
to play one afternoon and vanished




the next morning we find she in a
stone well on a neighboring
property

but slipped and broke i leg and
while we wait for the rescue team
to pull we out she die in i arm
if you have have a child

everything just focused down to one
thing to hold she and make she
feel safe
but no matter what i
said to she i could not stop she
shaking cry
she last moment
on this earth be filled with
terror
of a stone golem

then light snoring break the silence coming
through the wall
penelope snoring
bloom smile slightly
what a cute snore
the snoring deepen slightly
the clock on the wall advance from
be to
be and
through the window the horizon glow with the approach of
dawn
bloom lie wide awake on he back red rim eye wide open
the guttural snoring ringing in he ear


we four at the curator door

max

we be a little early


still and silent in the break light of morning
and totally empty
pick clean down to the bare wall
the only thing left in the apartment be the paint of the

death
poke around the room bloom open a closet
the curator
stand pressed against the back wall in he pajamas

bloom quickly close it

i do not get it
if he be
hightailing it he could have wait
eight hour till we trade the
million for the book and have some
travel money
well
back to
antique
nothing gain nothing
lost
and you get to see prague which be
nice
penelopes eye widen with realization

oh

awhile they have these amazing
puppet show opera thing
but stephen raise a hand to shut he up

oh

never see the book now it will just
rot in the catacomb
what a
waste
when penelope lift she suddenly brighten eye in a moment
of divine inspiration bloom meet she gaze with fear


bloom pace penelope look up at the castle with binoculars
the chink and stephen stand by

no
no no

piece of information we need



she spread the castle floor plan out on a bench
bloom turn to stephen and the chink with a this be crazy
right
expression and gesture
they give he nothing back

we would need to clear the
administrative office
some sort
of disruption
the chink stroke she chin in mockthoughtfulness

mon
help i break into this
castle
it will be fun


barbie doll set up in the middle of the field explode in a
theatrical plume of fire
several other follow suit
the chink pop up from behind a mound of dirt in she aviator
goggle cigarette dangle from she lip
she lean on a
detonator plung
bloom stephen and penelope crouch nearby watch she work

she be an artist with nitroglycerin
it be kind of she thing

i feel like i want to know more
about she

yeah
yeah

check the tat
on the back of the chink neck a few finely script line
of chinese




an inky wisp of personal
information
we transcribe it
bring it into a chinese
restaurant

what be it say

the literal translation be
something about water crane but
essentially it mean when you be
do with something blow it up



the chink lie on the floor with penelope showing she how to
build a tiny remotely detonate bomb
she slice a tiny bit
off a brick of dynamite set it in a petri dish with a
detonator and put the whole thing in a handbag
penelope appreciate she
bloom and stephen hunker over the castle floorplan

there be a smoke detector in these
empty room in the east tower
so
we plant and set off a tiny
tiny tiny charge
the chink click a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen
with a
a tiny poof of fire plume from the handbag setting it
on fire and the smoke rise to the ceiling

fire drill ensue office empty
and you will have exactly four and a
half minute to get through the
access hatch into the catacomb

the pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
other and the deluge of almost childlike need let loose in
this one simple act quickly reach a point where as a viewer
