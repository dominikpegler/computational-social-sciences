this




walter look after she then turn he collar up against the





so
how be you adjust

i be adjust okay



and you new apartment

apartment okay



be you taking you medication

it give i headach



but you be taking it

yeah

good
i will talk to you physician
about the headach
maybe he can
change the prescription

and how be you job

the job okay


do i take okay to mean you feel
good about working there

i said the job be okay

that be right you do
pause
have you make any friend there

i be not running for mr
popularity

you seem a little hostile today

that be a joke

it be called sarcasm dr
rosen

no need to call i doctor
i be a
therapist not a psychiatrist

it be all the same

walter i would like you to try
something for i

what


i would like you to keep a journal

diary

that be right

no way

why not

diary have send too many guy to
prison

i do not understand

evidence

oh
it never crossed i mind

of course

it be just an idea

bad idea

i think a journal would encourage
you to reflect

reflect

that be right


you think reflection be good

it be very good indeed

how be that

by reflection we can derive a
deeper meaning from we experience
in life
we gain great
understanding about ourselves that
can lead to making good choice
in we relationship we career
and we goal

you read that in a book

try it

no fuck way

then think about it


there a problem

problem

can you read the prescription

yes

can you fill the prescription

yes

then i suggest one of you move you
ass because if i do not get i
medication i get extremely violent
