four or five day

oh very well
i will just spend the weekend
alone by myself and take a little rest
i
should be used to it by now

used to what

to the fact of i retirement not only as a
diplomat but also as a father

protestingly and with a
deep sense of compassion
but how could you say such a thing

because it be true
after thirty year not
have ever spoken the truth to anyone i
should at least allow myself to do so with i
own daughter

and have you any other truth to tell i

and whom i have not see for a month

you know i could just as well go without
seeing he today

what
after giving we such a run around

i see
so it be farewell to the yacht
and
farewell to the cruise

you know it be terrible to be far away from one
another
really it be difficult to keep an
affair going when one be here and the other be
somewhere else
but at the same time
it be
comfort
because it give you a chance to
consider what you want and how you want it
but when he be right there before you all the
time
well he be right there
then with a sense
of exasperation
oh let we go back

i will be right down

would you like to see i profile

well what be it

but you friend be waiting downstairs

she will wait

i have a feel that you be not used to be
alone

glance first at sandro
and then at anna
that seem to apply to you also

do not be so humble

how should i be
arrogant

but of course
arrogant haughty
have not
anna ever told you

like this

it be all i fault

and who do you think make that hole over there

there be nothing much to laugh at

and that be what i say too
we could have all
be killed

i be sorry
but i can not help laughing

it be as smooth and slick as oil

i detest comparison make with oil

do you sleep well

yes fairly well
but i go to bed last night
planning to do some think about a number of
thing
instead i fell asleep

i do not know one could sleep so well on a
yacht
it lull you

it would be good for you to get some sun

shall we go for a swim

oh no

it look too
dangerous

at one time the aeolian isle be all
volcanoe

you must know you third grade geography book
inside out

what be that one over there called

that must be Basiluzzo

sound like the name of a fish merluzzo
basiluzzo

oh i goodness
all that yap just for a
little swim

anna

stop
stop the boat

how be the water

let we see you dive from the top of those rock
giulia
that would be really sensational
come
on giulia
you life be much too
circumscribed

what have everybody get against i this morning

raimondo

why have we stopped

lady patrizia

be not you going in for a swim patrizia

what make you think i would even dream of such
a thing
raimondo why do not you go in for a
dip

raimondo
do you enjoy fish underwater

i detest it
but after all what can you do
it be the late
and i try i good to adapt
myself

who ever said that man be originally a
creature of the sea

i have never understood the island
with all
that water around they poor thing

when do you have to go back

i do not know
it depend on ettore
he be
now in the process of negotiating for a
contract here in sicily

then how come you be not with he

what a question
because i want to be with
you naturally
i hope he do not close the
deal so he will leave i alone at least for a few
day
be not this water wonderful

i would like to find a place where i can get some
peace and rest maybe around here somewhere
i would like to try

what could be more restful than this
he open he eye and
be upright in the water
excuse i what be it that you want to try

where be she going

ask she

i have always work on pleasure boat
even
though it be more tire

why

because the owner never seem to have any fix
hour
for example last night we keep right on
sail
we do not even have a chance to get
some sleep
still i like it good

i be going ashore to take a look around the
island
there be some ruin up there

there too

well we be still in italy you know

what kind of a fish be that

it be a cernia

i god it be enormous

shark
shark

do not move lady
stay where you be
stop
everybody keep still

stay away

anna

but how do you become aware of it
do it
touch you

i would have die

and how ugly they be
with all those tooth

what happen

there be a shark in the area
do not move from
where you be

who be moving

here drink some cognac

it be
all over now

only i would like to change
i be a little cold

but where do the shark go to

which one shall i wear

this one be gorgeous

then why do not you try it on

it look good on you than it do on i
you keep it

you know that thing about the shark be all a
joke

there be the difference between you and i
you
know how to put over certain thing and i
do not
sometimes i envy you

but be not you afraid

madam shark never attack anybody
anyway the
raft be dark and they would not be able to see
it

so it be true that they be blind

how be you

fine
can not you see so yourself

i have an urge to put i foot on some land
be not you coming

anna
maybe it would be good to wait a
while

wait for what

well with a shark running loose around the
place i for one will not get aboard that raft
they will have to catch it first
i want to see
it right here before i foot dead or alive

well dead

will the three of we fit

sure sure
there be plenty of room

claudia be not you coming

i be certainly not going to swim across

we will send the raft back to you

and bring some cushion when you come and a
towel

okay
come ahead come ahead

i be taking the boat right up to the shore and
we will let you get off from the gangplank as
soon as we get there

what do you want raimondo
do you want i

few year ago maybe
but now
and then
at this hour of the day

come claudia do come in
there be no
romance going on here

there have you see enough now
be you
satisfy

now tell the truth be not you a bit
disappoint
but i already told you

if woman breast be colored yours would be
blue

tell i claudia what do you think of raimondo

i would say he be pretty deprave

oh no
quite the contrary
he be really just a
child

patrizia do not start in again
i would
rather be called deprave
unless you happen to
love child

you know i do not love anybody

i know dammit i know
and just think if there ever be a woman so
right so perfectly cut out for all kind of
dissipation degradation infidelity
of

of
of debaucheries it be she
well
anyway she be faithful
faithful out of
laziness
of unwillingness

he amuse i
i do not know of anything more
amuse
outside of this jigsaw puzzle
do not
you find it so claudia

one would have to be in love with somebody to
know that

have you ever be in love

not really
it be suffocate in here
shall
we go out

if any of you get into you bthe suit
again you can be sure we will not be seeing one
another for the rest of the year
i just can not
stand seeing anybody in the city after have
see they naked on the beach

oh how sweet
what a dear little darling

who be you talking to

to the shark

say claudia would not you like to climb up
with i and take a look over there

at what

at the ruin
they be very ancient you know

that sound like a good idea
but why do not we
all go together

please i beg of you stay here

well

well what

have you decided

all i said be that it sound like a good idea

why do not you ask i to go with you

do you know why
because if you see those ruin
i be sure you would have say they be very
very beautiful
you always say how beautiful
to everything whether it be the sea or a
baby or a cat
you have such a sensitive
little heart that it throb for anything

but corrado
if something be beautiful why
should not one say so

he never miss a chance to humiliate i to
let i know that he do not care about i any
more

giulia that remark be not worthy of we twelve
year of honest concubinage
i repeat once and
for all and publicly that i admire you
do
that please you

under she breath to
anna and sandro
twelve year
but why have not they marry

and why have not they left each other

i be beginning to have i doubt
it could not be
that they be in love

could be
they be the kind of people who be
capable of anything

the trouble with you be that nobody can speak
to you that be all

giulia do not you understand that the more
involve you become with people the more
difficult it be to speak with they

you man be all so dreadful

i know we be
but as the year go by we
become even bad
be not that so corrado

i hope so

how wonderful

that be Patrizias way of letting we know she be
with we

i think you be very sweet corrado

more so than the shark

there be no comparison

then why do not we go up and see the ruin

sandro
month be too long a time
i have
become used to be without you

you will get over it soon
it be the usual anxiety

little more so this time

so it will just take you a little long to
get over it

but i think we should talk about it
or be you
fully convince that we too will not understand
each other

there will be plenty of time to talk about it
later
we will get marry soon
that way
we will have more time

in this case get marry means nothing
be not we already the same as be marry
and corrado and giulia be not they already
the same as be marry

but why rattle you brain by argue and
talking
believe i anna word never help
at all
they only serve to confuse
i love you
anna
be not i that enough

no
it be not enough
i told you before that i
would like to get away for a while and be alone

but you just said that a month be too

i mean to stay away longer two month
a
year
three year
yes i know it sound
absurd
and i feel awful
the very idea of
losing you make i want to die
and yet
i
i just do not have the same feel for you
any more

and what about yesterday
at i house
do not you have any feel for i even then

there you go
must you always spoil
everything

look like the weather be changing

please giulia
must you always emphasize the
obvious
i can see for myself that the weather
be changing

we will have to get going

and where be anna
be not she on the yacht

i do not know
you see
we be taking a
little nap

you have make some mistake there with the
bush
that be why you can not finish it

take it easy raimondo
why be you get so
impatient

patrizia


be anna there

i do not think so

she be not here

this be the kind of behavior that drive i
crazy

do you find she

it be a lamb

find anything

no

perhaps she be taking a swim somewhere

it be really a fact there be nothing new under
the sun
now look here
look at this
structure
a kind of natural shelter
sandro
that be how you should design you house

i
i no longer have any interest in
build
and then where can you find
boulder of rock like this in milan

somebody must live here

but anna would not be staying with the kind of
people who live here

we have well get start
the storm may
break any minute now

what do you mean
what about anna

tell lady patrizia that we can not leave now
in
fact we will have to make a tour around the
island

would not it be good if you told that to the
lady yourself
i can not assume the
responsibility for keeping the boat here
there be no place to tie it up
and then
you know it be get a flat bottom and if the
sea get a little too rough

that do not make any difference
if we have to
stay we will stay

perhaps she be not feeling well
maybe a
cramp or something

anna be an excellent swimmer
even with a
cramp she would have managed to reach shore
somehow

but you have to consider all possibility
sandro

there be some footprint around here

patrizia

mario
steer the boat that way

shall i turn back

no
now that we be here let we have a look
around Basiluzzo
when we be swimming she swim out in that
direction

it will not be easy to find a place to go ashore

let we try to be practical about this
the good
thing to do be for all of you to go to the
close island that have a police station or
something and report the disappearance
i will
remain here
because
well i do not know
but it seem to i that something may turn up
anyway i just do not feel like leaving

then let we get start
it be senseless to
waste any more time

how long will it take to go there and come
back

if there be a police station at Panarea it
should take we a couple of hour
but if we
have to go to lipari it will take much longer
then it also depend on how rough the sea be

i will stay here also

but why
what if it start to rain

if it rain i will buy myself an umbrella

claudia i know how you feel but there be
already two of we staying

i will go even **further/far and say that she presence
here i do not want to sound offensive could
be a great hindrance

calling to corrado
from the boat
do you want some blanket

and something
to eat

as far as i be concern i think she be alive
why even this morning
that business about
the shark
it be not at all true

and why do you tell we this only now

i
i do not know
i do not think it be
worthwhile
she be laughing over it

really
still it remains to be see why she
invent a shark
what be she purpose in that

maybe you would well ask he

what be you and anna argue about
excuse i for be so indiscreet but this be
serious

nothing but the usual argument
the only
thing be if i remember correctly that
she said she have a need to be alone

and how do you explain that

be you the owner of this place

no
the owner be in australia

but where do you come from

from Panarea
why

ah then it be you
i hear a boat leaving
here at two of the clock today

it must have be around four or five

in the afternoon

no
in the morning
why
what be happen

nothing
nothing at all

but why do not you tell he
girl who be with we have disappeared

what do you mean
disappeared
be she
drowned

no she do not drown
she just disappeared
and nobody know where

and i suppose it be i fault
why do not you
tell he that too
that be what you believe
be not it

rather than be so occupied with i thought
you would have be good off trying to
understand what anna be think

have you search in back of the house to see
if she might have fallen off that cliff
last
month that be what happen to one of i
sheep
i look all over for it all day long
and it be not until late at night that i hear
it bleating
it have be there the whole
day
and be almost dead

anna



anna

come claudia
come back inside

be you feeling good

i be sorry about last night
please forgive i

you be very fond of anna be not you

yes very much so

have she ever spoken to you about i

occasionally but always with affection

and yet she seem to feel that we love for
she mine yours even she father in a
certain sense be not enough for she or
do not mean much to she

i know
i keep asking myself what i could have
do to prevent all this from happening

whose boat be that

what boat

just a moment ago
do not you hear the sound
of a motor

at this time of the year there be so many
boat

and how come you be up so early

early
be four in the morning early for you

how do you spend the night
in that hut
and what do you have to eat

what do you think

we too you know
it be disastrous
first at
Panarea where there be not any boat
then
at lipari where everybody be asleep
and
the phone call to rome

we have to notify she father

yes that be a very good idea

he will be here sometime today
then turning to sandro who
have just arrive on the scene
i also phone i house in milan
but ettore
have already left

anything new develop

unfortunately no

very well
first of all i will have they search
the water around the island
i bring two
frogman with i
meanwhile we will take a look
up around here

look marshal with those deep crevass
you will need some rope and ladder

do not worry we have get everything

another thing
there be an old man who life
here on the island

i know i know
one thing at a time

no who want cracker
why do not you go and
have some coffee make instead

nothing here

do not look at i like that marshal
i have
nothing to do with it

let we hope they do not find she
if they do
they would find she dead

listen patrizia
the marshal say there be a
current that pass by here and end up at
another island
i do not know which
he
want to send one of he man over to have a
look
one never know
do you mind if i ask
raimondo to go with he

i do not see why i should mind

i think that you might go and have a look
yourself

yes maybe that be good

what amaze i be sandro
he seem so calm

calm
he do not seem so to i
he be
awake all night

what be it

an ancient vase
there be a bury city under
here
it be full of this stuff

come on corrado tell we what century it
belong to

corrado why do not you ask they to give it to
we as a gift

really
so that you can stuff it with you
geranium

but be not you suppose to be on you way

yes
i be going
i be going now

it be already two hour
what be we going to
do

it take about twenty to twentytwo hour for
the current to reach here from Lisca bianca

and sometimes even twentyfour
depending on
the wind

if the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon
we will have to wait at least until three or four
of the clock

it belong to i
we find it

back
stand back

you see
it contain cigarette
we will have to
confiscate it

these people be contemptible
they have no
sense of dignity at all

and you say that come from Lisca bianca

it could not have come from anywhere else
at
least somewhere from that vicinity
but i
really can not understand it
contraband
cigarette on that island
it be the first time
that ever happen

look
i would like to get back to Lisca bianca

but how could we
at a time like this when we
just
well let we at least first have a look
around the other island
could be that
something might turn up there

but even here we be suppose to find who
know what
and all we bring back with we be
a crate of cigarette

as you wish

be it also true that you see no boat around
here at Lisca between yesterday and this
morning

how many time do i have to tell you marshal
that i be at Panarea

i believe you i believe you
but i be also
certain that you be hide something from i
i
can see it written all over you face
and
you know that i have never like you face
and
if you want to know something that gentleman
over there
who be a very important person
do not
like it either
so just keep that in mind
i will talk to you later

i presume by this method that you will be able to
uncover some new clue either a handkerchief or
an article of clthe
in other word
something which you man have not be able to
find as yet

without any doubt sir
if anything belonging
to the girl who have run away be still here on
this island

allow i to inform you that i daughter be not
a fugitive

i be sorry sir
i do not mean to put it that
way
but you must understand sir that i

i understand very well
only i do not want any
rash assumption to be make

here she valise sir

do you want i to open it

yes please

this look to i like a good sign
do not you
think so
as far as i be concern anyone who
read the bible could not have committed an act
of impropriety
why
as a matter of fact i
remember when i be in china many year ago i
happen to be involved in a similar situation
concerning an english woman the wife of
ambassador Shafford a good friend of mine
there too we find a bible
and i said at
the time that whatever have happen that clue
alone have definitely ruled out the possibility
of
suicide
why it be logical i said
that whoever read the bible believe in god
and therefore
then turning to claudia in an
almost supplicate tone of voice
no
you do not believe it
well as a matter of
fact i be right
the woman be find two
day later
it be a case of amnesia

sir if you have no objection may we start
the search

get everybody out of the way

okay
i will send they down to that part of the
beach over there

it be because of this
the dress
it be
because of this dress
anna give it to i
yesterday right after the swim

and what be we going to do now

we will try again

but be it really necessary
those two
beast
how absurd

Sandros here

i do not know he

it seem to i that at a moment like this

i do not want to know he

claudia listen
claudia

i do not think you would be back so early

we do not check the other island so

and why do not you go there

he wanted to come back

up until now those smuggler be operating
only around the palermo area
this will be a
nice surprise for the lieutenant in Milazzo
call up headquarters
bring they up to date and
have they give you instruction on what to do
with this crate

so
the boat we see yesterday afternoon might
have also be that of these smuggler
could it
be possible then that anna

evade Corrados question
and pursue he own thought
i wonder where they could have unloaded the
stuff
maybe right here at Lisca

i be saying
it might even be possible that
anna have left with they

but for what reason would she have wanted to go
away

listen marshal
as for there be reason
for going away anyone of we might have three
thousand of they
so you can assume that she
have they
what i want to know be it possible
that the smuggler might have taken she aboard

i think it be possible

marshal
headquarters be calling
they have
an important message

what be it about

they have stopped a suspiciouslooking boat a
few mile from here
yesterday afternoon
the
crew have be taken to Milazzo for questioning

do you hear that
what do you plan on do

we be in the hand of god

that be true
but in the meantime as far as
i be concern it be absolutely necessary to go
to Milazzo
i know that you have no desire to meet i and
i shall take pain not to impose myself upon
you
but besides you i be the close person
to you daughter

however that may be at this moment i daughter
have more need of she father than of you

pardon i for be so frank but there be
certain thing that a father especially a
father like you cannot understand
so do not
be stubborn
i be coming with you

patrizia what be you going to do

what do you want we to do
i do not know
myself
but we will do something

i will go and get i valise

we have decided to go to Montaldos place
in
fact ettore should already be there

good
then i will meet you there

i be going with the patrol boat to make a tour
around the island

to do what

i just can not leave without first searching
those island one by one

but be not you tire
i can just about manage
to stand on i foot
then turning around to look
for raimondo she call out
raimondo

here i be patrizia
i be always here

claudia be not coming with we
will you please
take care of she luggage
thanks

no sir lieutenant we be not even able to
drop anchor once
the sea be too rough

okay
just sign here
turning to a guard
standing at the door
have the next one come in
he be the last
be not he

they tell i you have a lot of trouble at home
be that right

yes sir
i sister be sick
and i
father too

so that be why you have turn to smuggling eh
you need the money
now i can help you
i can
see that you get some assistance from the
government
but first there be a little
formality we have get to take care of
just a
few question and then we can all go to
lunch
you friend tell i you drop
anchor three time

yes sir
three time

now we be get somewhere
they be beginning
to contradict each other
now look here you friend just swear to i
that you be not able to do any fish at all
because the sea be too rough
and what about
the other boat

what other boat

now look i man see it and they also see you
man throwing those crate overboard
what have
you get to say about that

i
i
be not feeling well
i
i be
sleep
i do not know anything
i
i be all mixed up and

but what be you saying
what be you
saying

now look here i be ready to forget the whole
thing
the cigarette the contraband
everything
if you would only tell i
you or
you friend
whether the girl be aboard
you boat and how far she go

just as i think
even if you caught they in
the act they would deny it
they always deny
everything
and then in this case if they
be to admit have have the girl aboard it
would mean they would be admitting to the charge
of carrying contraband
oh it be easy to say
talk
but if they do talk the follow
morning you would find they cold dead in front of
they doorstep

i think it would be worth i while to take a
run over to palermo
the chief of police there
be a very good friend of mine and i be sure
he will do whatever he can
i feel we be wasting
we time here
excuse i lieutenant
i hope
we see each other again under good
circumstance
and thank for everything

at any rate we will continue investigating
i
know that headquarters have send out an alarm to
all area

showing the newspaper
to the lieutenant
tell i lieutenant do you happen to know this


who write this article here

that be francesco Zuria
he be the news
correspondent

where can we locate he
do not you think that
by offering a reward to anyone who can give we
some information

Zuria be in messina
you might try he
shall
we phone he

have you any instruction for i lieutenant
may i return to lipari

yes
with whom do you leave the crate of
cigarette

i left it at the warehouse

pardon i sergeant but when do you get back

about two hour ago

and the young lady who be with you

i do not know
she said she have to catch a
train

where be you going
to Montaldos

yes

then i will go with you

have you read it
they be asking for anyone
with information to get in touch with they

yes
i have also think of going there to talk
with they

yes you should go

but then when will we see each other

i know it be difficult
but if you go on like
this it will become even more difficult

please do not look so solemn
and do not wait
for the train to come in

please please leave
i do not want to look out
of the window and wave to you with a
handkerchief

go ahead now say something
i want to know
just what it be we have to say to each other

sandro i do not want you to come with i i
do not want to see you
how can i make it
clear to you
why do you come

i do not know why
i just could not help it

but sooner or later we have get to end this
relationship
and it be good to do it right
now

i have no desire to sacrifice myself
it be
idiotic to sacrifice oneself
why
for
whom
if anna be here i might understand you
scruple
but she be not

oh sandro

i be sorry
i do not want to sound cynical
but
be not it good to look thing squarely in the
eye

for i they be exactly as they be when we
meet three day ago just three day ago
do not you realize
and you and anna
no i
guess they be not like that any more
i god
be it possible to forget in such a short time
for thing to change so quickly

it take even less

but it be so sad
so terribly sad
i be not used
to it i be not ready for it
you know
i
have never be so upset in i life
sandro
why do not you help i

i think the only way to help ourselves claudia
be for we to be together

no i be sure it will not
move over there
let we
make believe nothing happen
and when we get
to the next station get off

and what about you

i
i
i
please leave i alone

i work there but i be really a stranger

i tell you this acquaintance of mine know you
and she have often spoken to i about you

and who be she
do she work in catania

yes she take care of the garden

then it be impossible for she to know i
in the
villa where i be at we have a male gardener

so
that be logical
you see both being
gardener they speak about you to one another

and what do they say about i

they told i that you be a very nice girl
that you always mind you business
in other
word thing of that sort

we have a radio like this too

no not like this one

and why would not we have one like this

because this be a chinese radio

certainly a radio this small be very practical
it be especially useful for
i do not know
for travel

but for you what come first
music or love

music of course
to get a sweetheart one have
to look around but to get a radio all you
have to do be buy one

ah no
for i love come first
i be a man
and i know what be what
first love and then
music

claudia listen to i

no sandro please
i ask you as a favor

promise that you will not try to look for i
you should not try to look for i any more

but why claudia
why

even if you chase i away i
claudia let we
not wait any longer
after it will be too
late
come with i

do you have a good trip
it be such a
magnificent day
i be very happy that sicily be
able to give you so warm a welcome
and you do
deserve it
you be such a lovely blonde
come
i dear

and where be you from

and would
you happen to know of some intelligent
clergyman in rome who might be will to come
here and stay with we
we have we own private
little chapel
it be a masterpiece with
seventeenthcentury fresco
and the
remain of all we dead ancestor a wonderful
collection
he would find it very convenient
there and could say he own mass
then he
would have to spend a little time with i
husband who never see anyone to keep he
occupied

an intelligent clergyman princess
but i
think the intelligent clergyman of today have
so many other thing to do

well perhaps one with a little physical
handicap
one who be slightly lame for
example

well finally
we be beginning to get worry
about you too

but where do you finally end up

it be futile
we go all over

but why do she do these thing
she take a sip from
she glass then rise
i can not stand it any more

but how can you carry on a discussion in this
heat

but do not he say he be coming here

well what be you all waiting for
send a car
out to get he
he can not be more than a couple
of hundred mile away

to i the fact that have not show up be a good
sign
do you want to bet that he be find anna

maybe
but do you know that forty thousand
person a year disappear in italy without
leaving a single trace behind they
forty
thousand
almost as much as the entire
population of san siro
raimondo will you go
and see if you can locate sandro

first let the poor thing have something to eat

it would not really do you any harm to skip a
meal

i have never meet this sandro
what kind of a
person be he

himself by any chance

sandro

i can see sandro calling
anna over to he and saying

intend to get rid of you but since it be so
painful and complicate
and besides i
do not happen to have a gun on i

but the movie also interest i

how do you find the man of messina
be you
shock by they warm display of friendliness

no why should i be shock
we be in italy
not finland

and how be you received in palermo

in palermo i be with i husband
now i be
going to capri to write an article for the
tourist office

she do exactly the same thing in palermo

if you want to go back to you hotel
we be
ready to escort you

oh yes thank you

do you like she

she cost a hundred thousand lire

you be kidding

no i be not
why do you think she do all
this
it be one of the many way she can put
herself on display
when you bait the trap the
mouse will snap
to tell you the truth if it
be not for the fact that one hundred thousand
lire represent i whole month salary well
but you have something you wanted to ask i

i read one of you article regarding the
disappearance of a girl
i be that girl fianc

oh
i be sorry i have to rush but i have get to
write a story about this thing that just
happen
tell i exactly how it all turned
out

now listen if i have any information i
would not have come here to ask you
but i see
that you too lack any information

as a matter of fact i have already have several
phone call on that article
one said they have
see the miss girl in an automobile
somewhere in rome
another one said they see
she on the pier talking with some strange
sailor
could be she secretly left the
island by boat

be that possible

who know
another one have it that she
enter a store in Troina
this information
come from the storekeeper himself who stated
that such and such a girl have buy i do not
know what in he store
at Troina

be that far from here

about fifty mile or so
if you want i will give
you the name of the storekeeper

yes
of course
but you should also print
that in you paper
but right away tomorrow
morning
it be the local palermo paper be not
it
i mean it be widely read

yes but why do you think we reader would be
interest in such news now
even if i send it
the editor would not print it

you really must do i this one favor

pardon i but why must i do you a favor

then let we call it a business proposition
something to round out you salary

be you ready
i be not
that be all we needed
a cocktail party
the vitality some people
have irritate i
how do it look

it be divine

you say that just to flatter i

do you consider that a compliment

no

he want to show i he painting
he will not
let go of i anymore
poor thing he must
have a crush on i

please you come too

but for what reason should i come there

please do come
do not leave i alone with
he
he be capable of
i do not know
have
you notice he eye

giulia

here i be

claudia come and see
it be a nude

they be all nude if i be not mistaken

but why all nude

because there be no landscape as beautiful as a
woman

and where do you find the model

oh there be as many as one want

i think the model be something obsolete
nowadays
do not you claudia

it be strange how anxious woman be to display
themselves
it be almost a natural inclination

but how could they pose like that
i could not

why do not you try

i
goffredo you be mad
he be mad

not really

do not you ever paint man

answer i why do not you try posing
i will paint
you a beautiful portrait

but why i
ask claudia she be much more
beautiful than i

but i want to paint you
you appeal to i more

i appeal to you more

giulia

and tell corrado too that i be here
if he
want i
you can also tell he that i tiny
little heart be beating like mad and that at
this moment it be the only thing that interest
i
be that clear

it could not be any clear

now what do i have to do to be left in peace

i think all you have to do giulia be to close
the door

he be not at the hotel
and he probably be not
even in Milazzo
the room clerk said he rent
a car

claudia
let we go

i be not coming

but then why do you bother changing

giulia be like oscar wilde
give she the
superfluous and she will do without the
essential

that be he
he would die if he do not have somebody
to quote
he come up with quotation like that
even at a board of director meet

be patient i can not remember everything

but it even say what she buy
a bar of soap
so there be no point in making believe you can not
remember

young female stranger whose description
correspond with that of the miss girl come
into i store


she come and then she left
with he
but this
one will not admit it
you think i be not aware of it

but if i be carrying on with the girl why
would i want to give any of this information to
the newspaper

that be what i would like to know myself

fine that make two of we who want to know
in
fact three with he

ah lady amalia would you be interest in
knowing why i told the newspaper about a
certain girl who come here the other day and
then disappeared

disappear
who be she

where
when

and that make four
anybody else

you have to be precise
do this girl enter
you store or do not she

yes

be she blonde or brunette

brunette

blonde

how be she dressed

i do not quite remember
seem to i she wear a
black dress

he do not look at dress he look at what be
under they

pardon i but have anyone else be here asking
about this girl

no
i do not think so

thanks

any news

yes
but it be all so conflict
however
there be some slight indication

listen
in the paper they forget to say that
as soon as the girl left here she take the bus
to Noto
the bus leaf from the square over
there
i see she clearly
i come to the door
to see she off
she be a beautiful girl
lovely pair of leg

you be from rome be not you
i know right away
because i be from viterbo
he be a soldier
there and so
indicate she husband and
then quickly continue
i do not like it very much here

then why do not you go back

how long have you be marry

three month

well
thanks for the information

it be good if we present a happy picture no

tell the signora patrizia that we be
continuing the search
and that the signorina
claudia will manage to survive somehow

do you car break down

no
i only want some information

we be searching for a girl of about
twentyfive
seem she boarded this bus two
day ago in the afternoon
you should
remember she because she be a stranger around
here

she be a little nervous
darkhaired
with
a kerchief around she head

two day ago
be not there that midwife on
the bus too
sure that be right and she be
talking to some young woman

can you tell i where she get off

all i can tell you be that the midwife be from


okay thank

i god
let we hope it be she

i only exchanged a few casual word with she
as one would ordinarily do on a public bus

and do you remember where she get off

well
probably at the last stop which be Noto

after that you do not see she anymore

what be you trying to insinuate young lady
why should i have see she again
i do not do
anything that be illegitimate

oh no
what be you saying
i be not
insinuate anything

and furthermore i dear young lady
because
you really be a dear you know
if the story
of that girl be merely a pretext let we say
to get in touch with she then i feel it be i
duty to warn she
these thing be very very
dangerous especially in a neighborhood like
this where people occupy themselves more with
other people affair than they own

then you should also be able to tell i where a
young girl might stay in Noto
be there any
hotel or rooming house

there be the trinacria hotel
or the regina
near the municipal build
as for rooming
house i do not know

thank you

do not mention it
pleased to be of service
any time

look at that bridge
who know why they even
bothered to make it

look at that
a factory
a station
and
look at those track all full of weed
but
why

it be late
we should be going

let we get out of here fast
this be not a
town it be a cemetery

who know why they all left

sandro
maybe it be good that you go in alone

be you joking

do not think that i want to save myself from any
embarrassment from the awkwardness of meet
anna
it be not that
it be that you can say
certain thing easy if you be alone
please
sandro do try to understand i
it would
look like i be trying to influence you to
force you to control you
and that make i
feel uncomfortable

some cigarette please
do you have any
Nazionali with filter

what be it claudia

oh sandro
i be so ashamed of myself so
ashamed
i tried to hide myself
i feel so
small
i hate myself

do it please you to say such thing

oh no
it do not please i at all

then why do you say they

because what i be do be so ugly
because
if you told i right now
claudia i love
you i would believe you
sandro be about to say the phrase somewhat jokingly in the hope that it

no
because then i would force you to swear it
i would force you to tell i an infinite amount of
thing
and that would not be right it
could not be right
it would be absurd

good
it be good if it be absurd
that would
mean nothing much can be do about it

but just think the very same thing you have
said to she who know how many time
maybe
even just before we left while i be waiting
outside you place

so even if i do say they i be sincere with
she as i be now with you

i have never see a woman like you who need
to see everything so clearly

excuse i but would you mind pulling that cord
for i

thank you

at one time all these house be convent

look
what a fantastic scene
what movement
what disorder
they be very much concern
with scenographic effect
an extraordinary
sense of liberty

really i have get to stop this business with
ettore
i would like to go back and start
working on i own project again
you know i
have many idea

and why do you drop they

once they give i a job to draw up an estimate
for the construction of a school
it take i
only a day and a half to finish it and i get
paid six million lire
ever since then i have
be do estimate for other people
design

why be you looking at i like that

i be sure you would be able to design some very
lovely thing

i do not know about that
and then who be
interest in beautiful thing nowadays

claudia let we get marry

it
at a time like this

you look at i as though i have say something
foolish

and be you sure you want to marry i
be you
really sure
that you want to marry
i

that be why i ask you

so
oh how i wish that everything be so
much simple
that people could just come
together by the color of they hair or the size
of they shoe
what size shoe do you wear
size
that be a very lovely size
but i be
sorry i wear size

be you ready

but why be i so infatuated with you

hurry up now or it will begin to get hot
outside

yes yes yes yes
right away

okay
i understand
see you later

and you leave i here all alone
in this
hotel room

as soon as you be ready you can come down and
catch up with i

if we

have not be in touch with anybody
not even
with anna father
we should have at least
send a wire or telephone
let we be fair he
must be feeling awfully lonely

i do not doubt it
but at a time like this we be
the least suitable person to be with he
and
as far as telephone he
who know where he
be

come let we go
pack you thing and i will get
mine ready too

well i be looking for somebody else and who do

to get what he want

ettore must be feed up with i by now

oh no not at all
and then you know very well
that he will forgive you anything
just as long
as you admit to he that you be a bad driver
than he be

how do you manage to put up with all this
confusion
you always said people bear you

you should not always take i seriously

like dynamo

she be part
austrian but she be still i mother
i
childhood be like a tennis match

bounce i back and forth here and there

i childhood instead be a very sensible one

what do you mean by sensible

see you soon then

you see
just like a robot

come in

sandro listen
try not to get yourself too
involved tomorrow

be not you going to change

you said you wanted to quit working for ettore

sure that be what i said

wow it be ice cold

sandro i be not coming down

why

i be too sleepy

sleep be something one must learn to overcome
i learned how to do it when i be a child
i
never sleep
and i have friend who even sleep
less than i do
the one who go to bed first
paid a penalty
and we really do not do
anything
after seeing a movie we would go to a
cafe and discuss thing for a while
then
we would sit down on a bench somewhere
listen to
some drunkard
watch they putting up poster
or manifestoe
or look at the sheep pass
by
or go for a stroll around the market
place
or else we would go and wake up some girl
in the neighborhood by standing in front of she
window and calling out she name

you be that sleepy eh
what time do expect to
get up tomorrow

late very late

do you know that when i be a boy i wanted to
be a diplomat
can you imagine that
i a
diplomat
it be strange but i never think i would
be rich
i see myself living in a rooming house
full of genius

instead i have two apartment one in rome and
one in milan
as far as genius go it be a
habit i have never form
what do you think of
that

i look at thing differently
but maybe it be
best we talk about it some other time
do you
mind turning off that light over there

good night i love

good night
tell i that you love i

i love you

tell i once more

i do not love you

i deserve it

that be not true
i love you

well finally
come i will introduce you to i
friend

i want to take a look around first
i will join
you later

say i hope it be understood that start
tomorrow morning i will need to have you around
if you do not give i some figure to work with
how can i proceed

patrizia
patrizia
where be ettore

i imagine he must be inside sleep

would you please see if sandro be with he
he be not in he room
i be sorry to disturb you

ettore

what be it

nothing nothing at all
i be just looking
for sandro

and you expect to find he in here
go and ask
claudia

yes yes of course

patrizia i be afraid

more or less we be all afraid
especially at
night

i be afraid that anna have come back
i feel
she be back and that they be together

but what be get into you
we would have
known
sandro must be out in the garden
somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or
watch the break of dawn
it would be a lovely
surprise indeed if he turned out to be the
sentimental type

now listen
for god sake try not to let
yourself become obsess with that idea
go to
you room and get back into bed

just several day ago the thought of anna
be dead would have make i sick
and now i
do not even cry i be afraid she might be alive
everything be becoming so damned simple and
easy even to deprive one self of pain and
suffer

you should never wish to get melodramatic over
anything

yes you be right
i be sick and tire of be
like that
