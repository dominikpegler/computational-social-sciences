of the water
it be as if he feel he father

businessman walking in opposite direction
on the sidewalk both react like clockwork
they force he onto a bus against he will
a bus that do not normally stop outside
i build
and when i be giving chase the
bus never make another stop and i get the
feeling that the traffic and the pedestrian
be work together to make sure i never
catch up with it

oh so now it be also the pedestrian and
the bus and the car
what be you
saying the entire population of lower
manhattan be conspire to stop you finding
out that you father stage he death to
pursue a life as a street person

we have tighten security

why would he do this to we

old age
sentiment
you play someone
father all those year you
be
someone
father
he see the way truman be
he
feel responsible

indicate simeon through
the glass wall
you have be grooming a successor

he be not ready

jaw set firm refer
to truman on the monitor

christ
truman who have not sit on the john and have
an imaginary interview with barbara walters
who have not wanted to be somebody

that be just it
i think i
am
somebody

i used to dream all i friend and family
get together in a hotel room think of
way to fuck i up

sometimes i think it be in i head sometimes
i think it be for real

tru we have known each other since before
we could get a hardon

the only way we ever make it through
high school be cheating off each other
test paper
jesus they be identical
i always liked that because whatever the
answer be we be
right
together and we
be
wrong
together

the only night either of we ever spent
in jail we spent
together
and i wet
myself but you never told anyone
i be good man at you wedding and i
brother be good man at
i
wedding and
you do not talk to i for a month over
that and i do not blame you because you have
be more of a brother to i than he be
ever be
and i never shoulda let
i goddam father talk i into that

i know thing have not work out for
either of we like we used to sit up on
freemont street all night and dream they
would
we all let opportunity pass we
by none of we ask for the dance as
often as we should
i know that feel
when it be like everything slipping away
and you do not want to believe it so you
look for answer someplace else
but
well the point be i would gladly step
in front of traffic for you

and the last thing i would ever do be
lie to you

stare into Trumans
eye repeating the
word in he ear
and the last thing i would ever do be lie to you
think about it truman if everybody
in on it i would have to be in on it too
i be
not
in on it cos there be no
it

leaving he head close to
Christof
i can not thank you enough
i do not know
what happen
he be so close
it threw
i
i be indebted



you be watch truman total record of
human life
everything that occur here
be real
there be no recreation or
interruption
due to the live and unedited
nature of the program viewer discretion be
advise

welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
eight of truman and there can scarcely have
be a more momentous week in the show
history
i be you host michael conners and
this be a special edition of tru talk the
forum where we discuss and analyze recent
event with the show awardwinning creator
and producer Christof
refer to the image
of truman in the background
i remind viewer that as this be a live
history it be we practise to keep the image
of truman on screen at all time
welcome

thank you

before we start taking call the huge surge in
rating over the last few day how do you hope
to sustain that audience now that truman appear
to have reconciled himself return to normal

rating have never be we primary goal
i
imagine we will lose those voycurs only interest
in witnessing Trumans late torment
however
i be certain we core audience will remain loyal

but recent event have be
so
dramatic it do
raise the perennial question
what keep we
watch one man twentyfour hour a day
eating sleep work sitting for hour in
contemplation

it have to be the reality

we have become increasingly frustrated watch
actor give we phony emotion bored with
pyrotechnic and special effect
while the
world he inhabit be counterfeit there be
nothing fake about truman himself
no script
no cue card
it be not always shakespeare but
it be genuine
that be how he can support an
entire channel

window onto the human condition

i prefer to think of it as a
mirror
not only
do he give we a glimpse of the truth he
give we a glimpse of
ourselves

but how do you account for the popularity of
those eight hour a day when truman sleep

we find many viewer leave he on all night
for comfort
have not you ever watch you
child or you lover sleep

let we go to some of those viewer call

charlotte north carolina for Christof



hello

you be on caller
go ahead

Christof it be a great honor to speak with you

thank you

truman have never be close
the way he look
directly at we
speak
to we for the first time
do you think he will ever work it out

i do not believe so
not now
he test his
world as we all do at certain time and
eventually it
passed
the test
you have to
understand he be a man madeforTV the world
he occupy he only frame of reference
no for he to come even
this
close to the
truth be a remarkable testament to his
instinct

sacramento california you be on tru talk



how much of a strain have the last few day
place on the actor

work on truman have always be a huge
commitment for an actor not just in term
of separation from friend and family but
since truman essentially drive the plot
it be a neverending improvisation
recent
event have raised the pressure but also the
prestige

of course truman have always be very much
in
on
cast

as with we own live the only people he can not
cast be he family
otherwise he have final
approval able to elevate an extra into a lead
role as be the case with he only real friend
marlon or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
player

istanbul turkey you be on with worldrenowned
videographer Christof



Christof
i have admire you work i whole life
although i can not say i have see it all

who can

can you settle an argument for i
what be
the long time truman have be offcamera

in he entire life fortytwo minute

technical fault in account for most of
that time
the remainder generally result
from blindspots in the early day when truman
would stray out of range of we camera

the hague for Christof
the hague
lost they
Amagansett long island you be on tru talk



how can you say truman life a life like any other

sensing the thinly disguise
resentinent in the caller voice
i believe that to be so
i often feel the only
difference between Trumans life and we own
be that his be be more thoroughly documented
we all play we allot role



he be not a performer
he be a prisoner

he can leave at any time
if his be more
than just a vague ambition if he be
absolutely determined to discover the truth
there be no way we could prevent he
i think
what really distress you caller be that
ultimately he
prefer
the comfort of he cell

as if trying to convince herself
giving herself away
no you be wrong
he will
prove
you wrong
he can still do it

a thought occurring looking
directly into camera
do i know you caller
you voice sound familiar

recording a human life from birth to death
that be still the intention
you still believe
truman have more to contribute

more than ever
by unwittingly allow we to
witness he struggle he be constantly forcing
we to evaluate we own live
he give we hope

let we take another call
london england you be on tru talk

by definition truman have to be free of censorship
but have the recent violence and profanity
cause a problem for the sponsor



what be you looking for

he be premature be not he

only by two week

curious even then
like he could not
wait to get start

feeling out where the
conversation be headed
he eagerness to leave he mother womb
also mean he be the one selected

what be it like the first show

the ultimate live television
in competition
with five other unwanted pregnancy the
cast of a show determined by an air date
he be the one who arrive on cue

be it true what you said
on the show tonight
about letting he go if he wanted it badly
enough
would you really do that

it will not come to that

i hope we have get fresh extra

the rotation be make this morning
