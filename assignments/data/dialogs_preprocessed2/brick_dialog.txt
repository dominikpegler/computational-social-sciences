what happen

the paper say six dead three around
the house one girl in the trunk of
tug car and the pin and tug

yeah

tug tried to shoot he way out when the
police get there
they tied he to dode
too
same gun
and the girl

huh

well good thing you be not there


yeah

you think the girl be emily

probably

you loved she

yeah i do

you do all this because you loved she
and now it be finished
i love you

no

what

no it be not finished
tug pulled the
trigger on em and he get the fall but
the bull coulda find that out without
i

i set out to know who put she in the
spot who put she in front of the gun
that be you angel

what be you talking about


it be you
what you want the whole
tale
you want i to tell it to you

tell it to i

alright from the top
you have you
finger in brad Bramish for appearance
and to keep he buying from the pin who
you be hook with
emily come to you
and brad you see she for what she be
an insecure little girl trying to get
in
she go on the backburner
meanwhile maybe you be get bore
maybe just greedy so when the pin
score big with the brick you take you
shot
you hook one take half and cut
it back to size but you cut it bad
maybe accidentally maybe to down the
pin operation do not matter
you put
it back but poor frisco dose off it
and land in a coma
so now the pin fume maybe he be
jealous of brad so he come to brad
crowd looking for blood or at least a
scape
you know trouble
there be going
to be a war over this
and there be
emily
she trust you
she want in
it be duck soup

no

you frame she for the bad brick then
you cut she loose
you turn on you heel
and bite she in the throat
last week on
the payphone pico and alexander she
see something she be scare of
tug
car driving by the pin driving but she
would not have see the pin
no she be
across the street angel
she see the
passenger side
she see you
she see you
and run like she see some devil


brendan why be you

and she take the hit
dode hide she away
but the pin be on to she track she
down told she to meet he that they
would make good
give she a time and a
place
and send tug
just to get the
straight
but maybe you have talk tug
up or maybe he just blow a fuse but em
spring it on he that she have she kid
and he do what anyone could count on
tug do he hit she
she take the hit
for you
you let she take it

stop it

that be the tale

stop it

about you and brad involvement
in the pins running
i hope you do not
steal the brick last night
in you

that mean you do not let
i walk into a slaughterhouse
you
do not lead tug and the pin and they
