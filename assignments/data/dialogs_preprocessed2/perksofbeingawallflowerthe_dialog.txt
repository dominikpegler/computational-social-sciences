the title begin over black
we hear the sound of an old
typewriter
someone reaching out to we
the bell dings
announce the end of a line and we see we title

music begin picture fade up and we be in the city
downtown pittsburgh
look out of the back window like a
child in the back of a station wagon
we see light on building and everything that make we
wonder
we see the bridge
and the river below
and then
we enter
the tunnel
we keep moving backwards watch the light
golden
alive and hypnotic
the music carry we as we float out of
the tunnel
onto another bridge
and over the highway
we move into the night sky back through the tree through a
window and into


it be a neat and tidy little room
few poster or book
be
he be innocent hopeful awkward and likable
to everyone but he classmate
he sit at he desk write
a letter in pencil as he tape the title song through the
radio on he cassette boom box



dear friend i be writing to you because
she said you listen and understand and
do not try to sleep with that person at
that party even though you could have
please do not try to figure out who she be
because then you might figure out who i
am and i do not want you to do that

split level house

freshman the upper classmen used to get
she drunk at party
i guess she have a
reputation
but i do not care
