Bludvist be a man of the people
devote to free mankind from the
tyranny of dragon



he claimed that he alone could
control the dragon and that he
alone could keep we safe if we
choose to bow down and follow he

stupid

good one

until he wrapped himself in his
cloak and cry out then see how

flame and from it armored
dragon descend burning the hall
to the ground
