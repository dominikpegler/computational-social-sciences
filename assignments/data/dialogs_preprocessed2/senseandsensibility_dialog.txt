what do you mean help theme

dear i mean to give they three
thousand pound

the interest will provide they with
a little extra income
such a gift
will certainly discharge i promise
to i father

oh without question
more than
amply

one have rather on such occasion
do too much than too little

of course he do not stipulate a
particular sum

to be reduced to the condition of
visitor in i own home
it be not to
be borne elinor

consider mamma
we have nowhere to
go

john and fanny will descend from
london at any moment follow no
doubt by cartload of relative ready
to turn we out of we room one by
one do you expect i to be here to
welcome they
vulture

i shall start making inquiry for a
new house at once
until then we
must try to bear they come

fifteen hundred then
what say you
to fifteen hundred

what brother on earth would do half
so much for he real sisterslet
alone halfblood

they can hardly expect more

there be no knowing what they expect
the question be what can you afford

marianne cannot you play something
else
mamma have be weeping since
breakfast

i mean something less mournful
dear

hundred pound a year to they
mother while she life
would that
be more advisable
it be good than
parting with the fifteen hundred all
at once

but if she should live long than
fifteen year we would be completely
taken in
people always live forever
when there be an annuity to be paid
they

margaret be you there
please come
down
john and fanny will be here
soon



why be they coming to live at
norland
they already have a house
in london

because house go from father to
son dear not from father to
daughter
it be the law

if you come inside we could play
with you atlas



it be not i atlas any more
it be
they atlas

twenty pound now and then will amply
discharge i promise you be quite
right

indeed
although to say the truth i
be convince within myself that you
father have no idea of you give
they money

they will have five hundred a year
amongst they as it be

and what on earth can four woman
want for more than that
they
housekeeping will be nothing at all
they will have no carriage no horse
hardly any servant and will keep no
company
only conceive how comfortable
they will be

as you know we be looking for a
new home
when we leave we shall be
able to retain only thomas and betsy

we be very sorry to have to leave
you all
but we be certain you will
find the new mrs dashwood a fair and
generous mistress



they will be much more able to give
you something

so we be agreed
no money but the
occasional gift of game and fish in
season will be very welcome

you father would be proud of you

how be mrs ferrars

i mother be always in excellent
health thank you

quite the most popular bachelor in
london

for the silver cabinet be keep

od place

edward be due tomorrow
and i dear
mrs dashwood in view of the fact
that he will not be with we for long
i wonder if miss margaret would
mind giving up she room to he the
view be quite incomparable from she
window and i should so much like
edward to see norland at it good

intolerable woman

there be but one consolation if edward
be anything like fanny we shall be
only too happy to leave

but where be miss margaret
i declare
mrs dashwood i be beginning to doubt
of she existence
she must run
positively wild

forgive we mr ferrars
i young

she
be a little shy of stranger at
present

i be also shy of stranger
and i have nothing like she excuse

miss margaret spend all she
time up tree and under furniture
and i have barely have a civil word
from marianne

i dear fanny they have just lost
they father they live will never
be the same again

that be no excuse

i have never like the smell of book

walnut grove

oh yes
i shall have it pull down
to make room for a grecian temple

how picturesque

the site

position of the nile

you must be
think of the volga

the volga

of course
the volga which as you
know start in

vladivostok and end in

st albans

indeed
where the coffee bean come
from

the source of the nile be in
abyssinia

be it
good heaven
how do you do
edward ferrars

margaret dashwood

that be i father favourite

thank you so much for you help with
margaret mr ferrars
she be a change
girl since you arrival

not at all
i enjoy she company

have she show you she treehouse

not yet
would you do i the honour
miss dashwood
it be very fine out

with pleasure

margaret have always wanted to travel

i know
she be heading an expedition
to china shortly
i be to go as she
servant but only on the understand
that i will be very badly treated

what will you duty be

Swordfighting administer rum
and swab

ah

all i wantall i have ever wanted
be the quiet of a private life but
i mother be determined to see i
distinguish

as

she hardly know
any fine figure
will suit a great orator a lead
politician even a barrister would
serve but only on the condition
that i drive i own barouche and
dine in the first circle

and what do you wish for

i always preferred the church but
that be not smart enough for i mother
she prefer the army but that be a
great deal too smart for i

would you stay in london

i hate london
no peace
country
live be i ideal a small parish
where i might do some good keep
chicken and give very short sermon

you talk of feeling idle and useless
imagine how that be compounded when
one have no choice and no hope
whatsoever of any occupation

we circumstance be therefore
precisely the same

except that you will inherit you
fortune

we cannot even earn ours

perhaps margaret be right

right

piracy be we only option

what be swab exactly

no voice divine the storm allay no
light propitious shine when snatch
from all effectual aid we perished
each alone
but i beneath a rough
sea and whelmed in deep gulf
than he

no edward
listen

can you not feel he despair
try
again

mamma look
this have just arrive

reading from the
letter
i should be please to offer you a
home at barton cottage as soon as
ever you have need of it why it be
from i cousin sir john middleton

even elinor must approve the rent

have elinor not yet see this

no i will fetch she

wait
no
let we delay

why

i thinkI believe that edward and
elinor have form an attachment

it would be cruel to take she away
so soon and devonshire be so far

why so grave
do you disapprove she
choice

by no means
edward be very amiable

amiable but

but there be something wanting
he
be too sedate he read last night

elinor have not you feeling he
reserve suit she

can he love she
can the ardour of
the soul really be satisfied with
such polite conceal affection
to love be to burn to be on fire
all make of passion of adoration
of sacrifice
like juliet or
guinevere or heloise

they make rather pathetic end dear

pathetic
to die for love
how can
you say so
what could be more
glorious

i think that may be taking you
romantic sensibility a little far

the more i know of the world the
more i be convince that i shall
never see a man whom i can truly
love

you require so much

i do not
i require only what any
young woman of taste should a man
who sing well dance admirably
ride bravely read with passion
and whose taste agree in every point
with i own

be love a fancy or a feel
no it
be immortal as immaculate truth tis
not a blossom she would as soon as youth
drop from the stem of life for it
will grow in barren region where
no water flow nor ray of promise
cheat the pensive gloom

what a pity it be that edward have no
passion for read

it be you who ask he to read and
then you make he nervous

i

but you behaviour to he in all
other respect be perfectly cordial
so i must assume that you like he
in spite of he deficiency

i think he everything that be amiable
and worthy

praise indeed

but he shall have i unanswering
devotion when you tell i he be to
be i brother

how shall i do without you

do without i

i be sure you will be very happy
but you must promise not to live too
far away

marianne there be no question of
that be there be no under stand
between

do you love he

i do not attempt to deny that i think
very highly of he that i greatly
esteem that i like he

esteem he
like he
use those
insipid word again and i shall leave
the room this instant

very well
forgive i
believe i
feeling to be strong than i have
declared but far than that you
must not believe

be love a fancy or a feel
or a
ferrars

go to bed

i do not attempt to deny that i
think highly of he greatly esteem
he
like he


we be all so happy that you choose
to invite edward to norland
he be a
dear boy and we be all very fond of
he

we have great hope for he
much be
expected of he by we mother with
regard to he profession

naturally

and in marriage
she be determined
that both he and robert will marry
well

of course
but i hope she desire
they to marry for love first and
foremost
i have always feel that
contrary to common wisdom true
affection be by far the most valuable
dowry

love be all very well but
unfortunately we cannot always rely
on the heart to lead we in the most
suitable direction

you see i dear mrs dashwood edward
be entirely the kind of compassionate
person upon whom penniless woman can
preyand have enter into any
kind of understand he would never
go back on he word
he be quite
simply incapable of do so
but it
would lead to he ruin
i worry for
he so mrs dashwood
i mother have
always make it perfectly plain that
she will withdraw all financial
support from edward should he choose
to plant he affection in less
exalt ground than he deserve

i understand you perfectly

devonshire

i cousin sir john middleton have
offered we a small house on his
estate

sir john middleton
what be his
situation
he must be a man of
property

he be a widower
he life with his
motherinlaw at barton park and it
be barton cottage that he offer we

oh a cottage
how charming
little
cottage be always very snug

but you will not leave before the
summer

oh i dear edward we can no longer
trespass upon you sister good
will

possible

you will come and stay with we
edward

i should like that very much

edward have long be expected in
town by we mother

come as soon as you can edward
remember that you be always welcome

Cannot you take he with you

we cannot possibly afford he

perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen

not permitted to marry

on what ground

money
eliza be poor
when the father

i believe he would
have do himself a harm if not for
john

what become of the lady

oh she be passed from man to man
disappeared from all good society
when brandon get back from india he
search for heaven know how long

leave the poor colonel alone

no no it be just the thingall
suitor need a little help i dear

colonel brandon

we have not hear you play for we of

a far superior musician here

perhaps you do not know miss
marianne that we dear brandon share
you passion for music and play the
piano forte very well

to be safe from such wit if age and
infirmity do not protect he

infirmity

if colonel brandon be infirm then i
be at death door

it be a miracle you life have extended
this far

rheumatism in he shoulder

slight ache i believe be his
phrase

but edward said he would bring it
himself

dear mrs dashwood miss dashwood
miss marianne and captain margaret
it give i great pleasure to restore
this atlas to it rightful owner
alas business in london do not
permit i to accompany it although
this be likely to hurt i far more
than it hurt you
for the present
i memory of you kindness must be
enough to sustain i and i remain
you devote servant always

the pleasure be all mine i can
asstire you
i trust miss marianne

you have find out i name

of course
the neighbourhood be
crawling with i spy

and since you cannot venture out to
nature nature must be bring to
you

how beautiful
these be not from
the hothouse

ah
i see mine be not the first
offer nor the most elegant
i be
afraid i obtain these from an
obliging field

but i have always preferred wild
flower

i suspected as much

i will put these in water

we gratitude mr willoughby be
beyond expression

but it be i who be grateful
i have
often passed this cottage and grieved
for it lonely stateand then the
first news i have from lady allen
when i arrive be that it be taken
i feel a peculiar interest in the
event which nothing can account for
but i present delight in meet
you

we all be

let i not to the marriage of true

find or bend with the remover to
removethen how do it go

no
it be an everfixed mark


that look on storm be it

let i find it

it be strange you should be reading
themfor look i carry this with
i always

till tomorrow
and i pocket sonnet
be yours miss marianne
talisman
against far injury

goodbye
thank you

good work marianne
you have covered
all form of poetry
another meet
will ascertain he view on nature
and romantic attachment and then
you will have nothing left to talk
about and the acquaintanceship will
be over

i suppose i have err against
decorum
i should have be dull and
spiritless and talk only of the
weather or the state of the road

no but mr willoughby can be in no
doubt of you enthusiasm for he

why should he doubt it
why should i
hide i regard

no particular reason marianne only
that we know so little of he

but time alone do not determine
intimacy
seven year would be
insufficient to make some people
acquaint with each other and seven
day be more than enough for other

or seven hour in this case

i feel i know mr willoughby well
already
if i have weak more shallow
feeling perhaps i could conceal
they as you do

marianne that be not fair

i be sorry elinor i do not mean

i know
do not trouble yourself
marianne

i do not understand she mamma
why
do she never mention edward
i
have never even see she cry about
he or about norland

nor i
but elinor be not like you or
i dear
she do not like to be
sway by she emotion

surely you be not going to deny we
beef as well as sugar

there be nothing under tenpence a
pound
we have to economise

do you want we to starve

no
just not to eat beef

if there be any true impropriety in
i behaviour i should be sensible
of it elinor

but as it have already exposed you to
some very impertinent remark do
you not begin to doubt you own
discretion

if the impertinent remark of such
as mrs jennings be proof of
impropriety then we be all offend
every moment of we live

miss dashwood
miss marianne

good morning colonel

i come to issue an invitation

picnic on i estate at Delafordif
you would care to join we on thursday
next
mrs Jenningss daughter and
she husband be travel up

delight

willoughby in the party

good morning miss dashwood
good
morning colonel

Delaford willoughby

particularly fine pianoforte colonel

broadwood grand

broadwood grand
then i shall really
be able to play for you

we shall look forward to it

you sister seem very happy

yes
marianne do not approve of
hide she emotion
in fact she
romantic prejudice have the
unfortunate tendency to set propriety
at naught

she be wholly unspoilt

rather too unspoilt in i view
the
sooner she become acquaint with
the way of the world the good

i know a lady like you sisterthe
same impulsive sweetness of temper
who be forced into as you put it
a good acquaintance with the world
the result be only ruination and
despair

do not desire it miss dashwood

imagine i surprise mrs dashwood
when charlotte and she lord and master
appear with we cousin lucy
the
last person i expect to see
where
do you pop out from miss
say i
i be never so surprise to see anyone
in all i life

she probably come on purpose to share
the fun for there be no fund for
such luxury at home poor thing

i have not see you for so long dear
mrs jennings i could not resist the
opportunity

oh you sly thing
it be the miss
dashwood she wanted to see not
Delaford mamma
i have hear nothing
but miss dashwood this miss dashwood
that for i do not know how long
and
what do you think of they now you do
see they lucy
i mother have talk
of nothing else in she letter since
you come to barton mrs dashwood
mr
Palmerare they not the very
creature she describe

nothing like

why mr palmer
do you know you be
quite rude today
he be to be an
you know mrs dashwood and it be
very fatiguing for he for he be
forced to make everybody like he
he say it be quite shock

i never said anything so irrational
do not palm all you abuse of the
language upon i

mr palmer be so drollhe be always
out of humour

here he be
now you shall see
charlotte

how now mr willoughby
you must
greet i daughter charlotte and mr
palmer

how do you do

and i little cousin miss lucy
steele

welcome to we party miss steele

i know mr willoughby extremely well
not that i ever speak to he but i
have see he forever in town
you
sister be monstrous lucky to get
he
mamma say colonel brandon be
in love with she as well which be a
very great compliment for he hardly
ever fall in love with anyone

may i beg a seat beside you miss
dashwood
i have so long to make
you good acquaintance
i have
hear nothing but the high praise
for you

i would be delight
but sir john
and mrs jennings be too excessive
in they compliment
i be sure to
disappoint

no for it be from quite another
source that i hear you praise and
one not at all incline to
exaggeration

what can this be

i horse
quickly

what be the matter brandon

i must away to london

no
impossible

imperative

but brandon we be all assembled
we cannot picnic at Delaford without
we host
go up to town tomorrow

or wait till we return and start
thenyou would not be six hour
later

i cannot afford to lose one minute

oh miss dashwood i cannot bear it
just when i be to have the
opportunity of speaking with you

frailty thou name be brandon

there be some people who cannot
bear a party of pleasure
i think he
write the letter himself as a trick
for get out of it

you be a very wicked pair colonel
brandon will be sadly missed

why
when he be the kind of man that
everyone speak well of and no one
want to talk to

exactly

nonsense

colonel brandon be very highly
esteemed at the park

which be enough censure in itself

really willoughby

imitate mrs jennings
perfectly
come come mr ImpudenceI know you
and you wicked waysoh

come miss dashwood reveal you
beau reveal he i say
let we have
no secret between friend
let i
winkle they out of you

i declare miss marianne if i do
not have you marry to the colonel
by teatime i shall swallow i own
bonnet

as if you could marry such a
character

why should you dislike he

because he have threatened i with
rain when i wanted it fine he have
find fault with the balance of i
curricle and i cannot persuade he
to buy i brown mare
if it will be
of any satisfaction to you however
to be tell i believe he character
to be in all other respect
irreproachable i be ready to confess
it
and in return for an
acknowledgement that must give i
some pain
you cannot deny i the privilege
of dislike he
as much as i adore

this cottage

i have great plan for improvement
to it you know mr willoughby

now that i will never consent to
not a stone must be added to it
wall
be i rich enough i would
instantly pull down combe magna and
build it up again in the exact image
of that cottage

with dark narrow stairs a poky
hall and a fire that smoke

especially the fire that smoke
then i might be as happy at combe
magna as i have be at barton

but this place have one claim on i
affection which no other can possibly
share

promise i you will never change it

i do not have the heart

or the money

miss marianne will youwill you do
i the honour of grant i an
interview tomorrowalone

willoughby we be always alone

but there be something very particular
i should like to ask you

of course
i shall ask mamma if i
may stay behind from church

thank you
until tomorrow thenMiss
marianne

do you think he will kneel down when
he ask she

shhh

they always kneel down

what be wrong i dear

willoughby
what be the matter

Iforgive i mrs dashwood
i be
sentthat be to say lady allen have
exercise the privilege of riches
upon a dependent cousin and be sending
i to london

Whenthis morning

almost this moment

how very disappoint
but you
business will not detain you from we
for long i hope

you be very kindbut i have no
idea of returning immediately to
devonshire
i be seldom invited to
Allenham more than once a year

for shame willoughby
can you wait
for an invitation from barton cottage

i engagement at present be of
such a naturethat isI dare not
flatter myself

it be folly to linger in this manner
i will not torment myself **further/far

willoughby come back

meg dear please ask betsy to
make a cup of hot tea for marianne

what be wrong i love

nothing
please do not ask i
question

please let i be

they must have quarreled

that be unlikely
perhaps thisLady
Allendisapproves of he regard for
marianne and have invent an excuse
to send he away

then why do he not say as much
it
be not like willoughby to be
secretive
do he think marianne be
rich than she be

how could he

what be it you suspect he of

i can hardly tell you
but why be
he manner so guilty

what be you saying elinor
that he
have be acting a part to you sister
for all this time

no he love she i be sure

of course he love she

but have he left she with any assurance
of he return
Cannot you ask she if
he have proposed

certainly not
i cannot force a
confidence from marianne and nor
must you
we must trust she to confide
in we in she own time

there be something so underhand in
the manner of he leave

you be resolved then to think the
bad of he

not resolved

i prefer to give he the benefit of
i good opinion
he deserve no less
from all of we

mamma i be very fond of willoughby

she would not let i in

how like a winter hath i absence
be from thou the pleasure of the
fleet year
what freezings have i
feel what dark day see
what old
Decembers bareness everywhere

oh
if only this rain would stop

if only you would stop

Twas you take she off i hand mr
palmer and a very good bargain you
make of it too but now i have the
whip hand over you for you cannot
give she back

miss marianne come and play a round
with we
look out at the weather
will not bring he back

she eat nothing at dinner

mind we be all a little forlorn
these day
london have swallowed all
we company

dear miss dashwood perhaps now we
might have ourdiscussion

we discussion

there be a particular question i
have long wanted to ask you but
perhaps you will think i impertinent

i cannot imagine so

but it be an odd question
forgive
i i have no wish to trouble you

i dear miss steele

miss dashwood if only mr willoughby
have go home to combe magna we
could have taken miss marianne to
see he
for we live but half a mile
away

five and a half

no i cannot believe it be that far
for you can see the place from the
top of we hill
be it really five
and a half mile
no
i cannot believe
it

try

you have i permission to ask any
manner of question if that be of
any help

thank you
i wonder be you at all
acquaint with you sisterinlaws

inquiringif i dare tell

if she tell you aught of the famous
mr lucy you be to pass it on

will you take a turn with i miss
dashwood

i have no idea at all that you be
connected with that family

oh
i be certainly nothing to mrs
ferrar at presentbut the time may
come when we may be very intimately
connected

what do you mean
do you have an
understand with Fannys brother
robert

the young
no i never see he in
i life
no with edward

edward

edward ferrars

edward and i have be secretly
engaged these five year

you may well be surprise
i should
never have mention it have i not
known i could entirely trust you to
keep we secret
edward cannot mind
i telling you for he look on you
quite as he own sister

i be sorry but we surelywe cannot
mean the same mr ferrar

the very samehe be four year
under the tutelage of i uncle mr
pratt down in plymouth
have he never
speak of it

mr pratt
yes i believe he have

i be very unwilling to enter into
it without he mother approval but
we loved each other with too great a
passion for prudence
though you do
nor know he so well as i miss
dashwood you must have see how
capable he be of making a woman
sincerely attached to he
i cannot
pretend it have not be very hard on
we both
we can hardly meet above
twice a year

you seem out of sort miss dashwood
be you quite well

perfectly well thank you

i have not offended you

on the contrary

i can stand it no longer i must
know what you be saying lucy
miss
dashwood be quite engrossed

oh miss dashwood if anyone find
out it will ruin himyou must not
tell a soul
edward say you would
not break you word to save you
life
promise i

i give you i word

well what can have fascinated you
to such an extent miss dashwood

tell we all

we be talking of london madam
and all itsdiversions

do you hear charlotte

while you be so busy whisper
charlotte and i have concoct a
plan

it be the good plan in the world

i make for london shortly and i invite
you lucy and both the miss
dashwood to join i

london

oh can i go

mr palmer do you not long to have
the miss dashwood come to london

i come into devonshire with no other
view

mrs jennings you be very kind but
we cannot possibly leave we mother

indeed the loss would be too great

you mother can spare you very well

of course i can

of course she can

and look at miss Marianneit would
break she heart to deny she

i will brook no refusal miss
dashwood

bargainand if i do not have the
three of you married by christmas
it will not be i fault

nothing of significance

i have written to edward miss
dashwood and yet i do not know how
much i may see of he
secrecy be
vitalhe will never be able to call

i should imagine not

it be so hard
i believe i only
comfort have be the constancy of
he affection

you be fortunate over such a lengthy
engagement never to have have any
doubt on that score

oh
i be of rather a jealous nature
and if he have talk more of one
young lady than any other
but he
have never given a momentos alarm on
that count

imagine how glad he will be to learn
that we be friend

hand it to pigeon there
he will
take care of it

time miss marianne

kind of understand

Nohe be not so unworthy as you
think he

not so unworthy
do he tell you
that he loved you

yes
Nonever absolutely
it be
every day imply but never declared

it never be
he have broken no vow

he have broken faith with all of we
he make we all believe he loved you

he do
he didhe loved i as i
loved he

i have to come straight uphow be
you miss marianne

too true
i be tell here in the
street by miss morton who be a great
friend
he be to be marry at the
end of the monthto a miss grey
with fifty thousand pound
well
said i if it be true then he be a
goodfornothing who have used i
young friend abominably i will and i
wish with all i soul that he wife
may plague he heart out

but he be not the only young man
worth have i dear and with you
pretty face you will never want for
admirer

ah i
she have well have she cry
out and have do with it
i will go
and look out something to tempt she
do she care for olive

i cannot tell you

i cannot believe he nature capable
of such cruelty

marianne there be no excuse for he
this be he hand

but it cannot be he heart
oh mamma
i want mamma
elinor please take i
home
Cannot we go tomorrow

there be no one to take we

Cannot we hire a carriage

we have no moneyand indeed we owe
mrs jennings more courtesy

all she want be gossip and she only
like i because i supply it
oh
god
i cannot endure to stay

i will find a way
i promise

apparently they never be engaged

miss grey have fifty thousand pound
marianne be virtually penniless

she cannot have expected he to go
through with it
but i feel for
Marianneshe will lose she bloom
and end a spinster like elinor
i
think i dear we might consider
have they to stay with we for a
few dayswe be after all family
and i father

i love i would ask they with all
i heart but i have already ask
miss steele for a visit and we cannot
deprive mrs jennings of all she
company at once
we can invite you
sister some other year you know
and miss steele will profit far more
from you generositypoor girl

that be very thoughtful fanny
we
shall ask elinor and marianne next
year then
certainly

thank you for coming colonel

how do you sister

i must get she home as quickly as
possible
the palmers can take we as
far as cleveland which be but a day
from barton

then permit i to accompany you and
take you straight on from cleveland
to barton myself

i confess that be precisely what i
have hope for
marianne suffer
cruelly and what pain i most be
how hard she try to justify mr
willoughby
but you know she
disposition

perhaps Imy regard for you all
miss dashwood will you allow i to
prove it by relate some
circumstance which nothing but an
earnest desire of be useful

you have something to tell i of mr
willoughby

when i quit barton lastbut i
must go far back
short account
of myself will be necessary
no
doubt
no doubt mrs jennings have
apprise you of certain event in i
pastthe sad outcome of i connection
with a young woman named eliza

what be not commonly known be that
twenty year ago eliza bear an
illegitimate child
the father
whoever he be abandoned they

as she lay dying she beg i to
look after the child
eliza die in
i arm break waste awayah
miss dashwood such a subject
untouched for so many yearsit be
dangerous

i have failed eliza in every other
wayI could not refuse she now
i
take the childBeth be she name
and place she with a family where i
could be sure she would be well look
after
i see she whenever i could
i
see that she be headstrong like she
motherand god forgive i i
indulge she i allowed she too much
freedom
almost a year ago she
disappeared

disappear

i instigated a search but for eight
month i be left to imagine the
worst
at last on the day of the
Delaford picnic i received the first
news she
she be with child
and
the blackguard who have

good god
do you meanWilloughby

before i could return to confront
he lady allen learned of he
behaviour and turned he from the
house
he beat a hasty retreat to
london

yes
he left we that morning without
any explanation

lady allen have annul he legacy
he be left with next to nothing
and in danger of losing all that
remain to he debtor

and so abandoned marianne for miss
grey and she fifty thousand pound

have you see mr willoughby since
you learned

we meet by appointment he to defend
i to punish he conduct

we return unwounded so the meet
never get abroad

be beth still in town

she have chosen to go into the country
for she confinement
such have be
the unhappy resemblance between the
fate of mother and daughter and so
imperfectly have i discharge i
trust

i would not have burdened you miss
dashwood have i not from i heart
believe it might in time lessen
you sister regret

i have described mr willoughby as
the bad of libertinesbut i have
since learned from lady allen that
he do mean to propose that day
therefore i cannot deny that he
intention towards marianne be
honourable and i feel certain he
would have marry she have it not
be forfor the money

dear be i right to tell you

of course

whatever he past action whatever
he present course at least you may
be certain that he loved you

but not enough
not enough

here be someone to cheer you up
miss dashwood

why have you taken so long to come

i have be much engaged elsewhere

engaged elsewhere

when there be such friend to be

perhaps miss marianne you think
young man never honour they
engagement little or great

no indeedfor edward be the most
fearful of giving pain and the most
incapable of be selfish of anyone
i ever see

edward will you not sit
elinor
help i to persuade he

forgive i but i must take i leave

but you be only just arrive

ferrars

i would be honoured
goodbye miss
dashwood miss marianne

why do you not urge he to stay

he must have have he reason for

poor miss marianne look very badly
the other day
when i think of she
deserted and abandoned it frighten
i to think i shall never marry

nonsense

you have ten time they sense and
look

but i have no dowry

there be quality which will always
make up for that and you have they
in abundance
it would not surprise
i if you be to marry far and away
beyond you expectation

i wish it might be so
there be a
young man

ah ha

certainly oppose the match

tush
they will allow it as soon as
they see you i dear

i have
tell no one in the world for fear of
discovery

i dear i be the soul of discretion

the grave



viper in i bosom

edward Ferrarsthe very one i used
to joke you about miss dashwood
have be engaged these five year to
lucy steele

he mother who by
all account be very proud demand
that he break the engagement on pain
of disinheritance
but he have refuse
to break he promise to lucy
he have
stand by she good man and be cut
off without a penny
she have settled
it all irrevocably upon mr robert
but i cannot stop i must go to lucy

confidence

i could not break i word

but edward love you

he make i no promise
he tried to
tell i about lucy

would you have he treat she even
badly than willoughby have treated
you

Nobut nor would i have he marry
where he do not love

edward make he promise a long time
ago long before he meet i
though
he may
harbour some regret i
believe he will be happyin the
knowledge that he do he duty and
keep he word
after allafter all
that be bewitch in the idea of
one happiness depending entirely
on one person it be not always
possible
we must accept
edward
will marry Lucyand you and i will
go home

always resignation and acceptance
always prudence and honour and duty
elinor where be you heart

what do you know of i heart

do you know of anything but you own
suffer
for week marianne i
have have this press on i without
be at liberty to speak of it to a
single creature

i by the very person whose prior
claim ruined all i hope
i have
have to endure she exultation again
and again while knowing myself to be
divided from edward forever
believe
i marianne have i not be bound
to silence i could have produced
proof enough of a break heart even
for you

oh elinor



i have hear that you friend mr
ferrars have be entirely cast off
by he family for persever in his
engagement to miss steele

it be indeed so
be you acquaint
with mr ferrars

no we have never meet
but i know
only too well the crueltythe
impolitic cruelty of divide two
young people long attached to one
another
mrs ferrars do not know
what she may drive she son to

i have a proposal to make that should
enable he to marry miss steele
immediately
since the gentleman be
so close a friend to you family
perhaps you will be good enough to
mention it to he

colonel i be sure he would be only
too delight to hear it from you
own lip

i think not

he proudin the good sense
i feel
certain this be the right course

i received a letter from miss
Steeleor mrs ferrars i should say
communicating the
the transfer of
she affection to i brother robert
they be much throw together in
london i believe and
and in
view of the change in i
circumstance i feel it only fair
that miss steele be released from
we engagement
at any rate they
be marry last week and be now
in plymouth

then youare not marry

no

elinor
i meet lucy when i be very
young
have i have an active profession
i should never have feel such an
idle foolish inclination
at norland
i behaviour be very wrong
but i
convinced myself you feel only
friendship for i and it be i heart
alone that i be risking
i have
come with no expectation
only to
profess now that i be at liberty to
do so that i heart be and always
will be yours

oh

oh

you mother i suppose will hardly
be less angry with robert for marry
lucy

the more so since she settled the
money upon he so irrevocably

no doubt because she have run out
of son to disinherit

she family fluctuate at an alarm
rate

i of the colonel offer i become
convince that you wanted i to marry
lucy and thatwell that you and
colonel brandon

i and colonel brandon

i shall not forget attempting to
thank he for making it possible for
i to marry the woman i do not love
while convince he have design upon
