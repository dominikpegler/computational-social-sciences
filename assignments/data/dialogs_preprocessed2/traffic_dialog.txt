which allowed police to raid a private
farm

mr
Rodman
it be too bad you client
do not show as much sense in choosing
what he planted as he do in choosing
he attorney

lately the only variation i be hearing
in you argument be the name of the
client
and you can sit there all
day argue the in and out of
illinois v
gate but you be not
going to convince i that this country
have not sanction the use of
anonymous informant
furthermore there be no sacred
protection of property right in the
unite sate
when you make the
decision to have marijuana on you
farm whether it be one joint or an
acre of plant you property can be
seize and you property can be sell


i be sorry the court find i argument
repetitious

mr
Rodman may i offer a piece of
advice
the next time you argue
this point before this court
regardless of i whereabouts i
recommend you have something up you
sleeve other than you arm

depend who it be from

you friend at warren putnam and
hudson

something from i
re
the elaborate
box
definitely third category

what would a law firm want from the
new drug czar

depend on the state

just watch

inhale the smoke and hold it

what be this like freebase

not like
it be

go
go

hold it

see
now you see

more


until you officially take over the
office of national drug control
policy under no circumstance should
you speak to the press unprotected
without going through this office or
have someone in the room
there
be a lot of interest in this town
and right now they be all scare
of you
the reason they be scare
of you
technically you have veto
power over they budget
so think
about that

radio
shack and the they be all going to
want to speak to you
and that be
the good news
you will also be
meet senator and congressman
each with a specially prepare
question
they question be design
for one thing
to make they look
smart
if you lecture they they
will not think you respect they
if
you respond with utter humility
they will
remember this be about
you respect for they and the
president respect for they
speaking of which as soon as he
get back from russia and china
we will get you in there for some face
time let the two of you catch up
it would probably be a good idea for you
to meet you predecessor
i will have
jeff sheridan take you over
also four week from today you will
give you first official press
conference
in it you will outline
the president strategy for winning
the war on drug
okay anything else

i will be sure to let you know

i just want to be clear about one
thing
i used to work for he but
now i work for you
i be not a
partisan person i be an issue person
in the next few week if you allow
i we will get you wellversed on an
incredible array of issue
the
most important of which in i
opinion be mexico
i know
everybody that you be going to meet
it be important that they like you
it be not important that they like
i
that be why i can help protect
you

like you protected landry

i see where you be going with that
but if i could just say something
which be basically that a guy like
landry be so autocratic he do not
know how to let himself be helped
it be a point of pride to take every
bullet no matter who fired it or
whether it be even aim at he
which personally i think it very
selfdefeating
now do not get i
wrong he be a man of enormous
integrity but there be a political
component to this job that the general
just do not have any patience for

jeff you want to excuse we for a
minute

bemuse off
Sheridans exit
functionary
nice people the
schedule cs
about twelve graduate
degree apiece but it seem sometimes
all they do be start rumor

you have do a fine job here sir
the office of national drug control
policy be in good shape than when
you find it

i be not sure i make the slight
difference
i tried
i really do

there be a lot of encouraging
statistics
the work just start
but i intend to see it through
you have get i word on that

you be here for two year three
maximum
Whatd they promise you
court appointment
what
district
appeal
check roberts
reaction
not supreme
supreme

i have come in to do a tough job and
that be what i be going to focus on

when kruschev be forced out he sit
down and write two letter and hand
they to he successor
he said when
you get into a situation you can not
get out of open the first letter
and you will be saved
and when you
get into another situation you can not
get out of open the second
soon
enough this guy find himself in a
tight place
so he opened the first
letter
it said blame everything
on i
so he blame the old guy
and it worked like a charm
he get into another situation he
could not get out of so he opened
the second letter which read sit
down and write two letter



relax
if they be going to kill
we they would have do it in the
desert

they would not do it in front of all
these people
they would send someone
later when we be alone

away from the car
now

even if that be true they be not
going to come to you house where
you be waiting for they

he be right
they will do it when you be
walking somewhere make it look like
street crime

shut you fuck mouth
Nobodys
talking to you

if you want she to stay out of it
then stop telling she everything
you should learn how to keep a secret

she be nosy
she hear i on the
telephone

anyway i do not think we will ever see
they again
Everythings back to

especially tiger wood
actually he keep his on the
back seat

gates Myrhvold Bezos
i sell to
all those guy
why
because the
technology to intrude have reach
the mass
you competitor you
exspouse adversary stalker
they be at the local electronics
store right now and they be going to
be intrude on you not only through
you telephone but you fax cell
phone pager cable musak
window wall air conditioning
ventilation modem and internet
connection

nobody have these baby no way not
the shiznit

i want to intercept cell phone call
digital and analog
and locate the
source of the call
i need database
capability to crossreference call
and number

you cellular secretary friend across
all the digital wireless spread
spectrum
so francisco what do you do
you
a
private security

assassin

assassin okay
let we get you start
in surveillance

we in the legal drug business and i
mean merck pfizer the rest of i
very powerful client realize this
be not a war with a traditional winner
and loser but an organism at war
with itself whose weapon of mass
destruction happen to be intoxicant
and if you want a body count look no
**further/far than alcohol which rack up
kill a year
cocaine manage
a measly
same for heroin
but the big daddy be big tobacco
which kill each year which
by the way be more people than have
be killed by all the illegal drug
in the last century

that be very interesting

it be time robert to choke some
honesty out of these rural
legislator
get to fess up that
it be pretty much prison or casino
in term of they choice for economic
growth

what be the difference between prozac
and ecstacy you ask
one a
mattress and the other a trampoline
molecule do not have morality
really think about it
some molecule
change the way a serotonin reuptake
inhibitor work it be not suddenly a
bad molecule
it be just a molecule
i theory
america have a real fear
of short intense experience

like you

robert at the bar get another
scotch
secretive man s
nerdy sidle up beside he and
whisper furtively in he ear

chemical
some say problem other
say solution
imagine a cloud that
when it rain prohibit the growth
of poppy or take the out of
marijuana
imagine a pill that
eliminate any psychological crave
from Dilaudid to dove bar
law
enforcement have not let science sit
on the sideline
addiction be no
more relevant than polio or the black
plague

you be not battling trafficker or
dealer but a market and the market
contain a paradox
if you arrest
trafficker you raise price and
you also raise profit which bring
more trafficker into the business

back in the real world we be talking
about mexico and not john maynard
keynes
we will spend billion
dollar this year on this war and
the question on the table every year
be do we certify mexico as an ally
or not

you want to make a difference hit
the user
you do not jeopardize we
financial market by some hypocritical
stance on drug consumption
we be
snort it why penalize mexico for
supplying it

mexico do not talk to i about
mexico

it be the stick of law enforcement
that create the carrot of huge
profit
that be economic truth

addict do not vote
they do not have
pacs
they do not spend soft money
that be political truth

we be locking they up and
consumption be falling

the price of coke and heroin have
drop and purity have increased
all this law enforcement have achieve
be kid can get good stuff cheap
in economic term you can forget
it
this be not a winnable war

christ you want to decertify
somebody take pakistan or columbia
we do not need they for anything

if you manage to seize an
inconceivable percent of all drug
coming into this country you will
still raise the price of coke and
heroin less than percent which
will not affect drug use at all

why be we calling this a war at
all
you do not declare war on you
own people
addiction be a little
worm that gnaw a house apart from
the inside

we need mexico for these reason
number one defense
two trade
three tourism
then way on down
the line come drug
the president
know this
why be he holding
everybody foot to the fire

mr
wakefield there be a situation
that need you attention right away

one in sixteen american be of mexican
descent
mexico we third large
trade partner

you be looking pretty good for an
old guy

i work keep i young

which part get terrorist loose
on bail or free convict murderer
on technicality

the bad serial killer in history
who
Gacy right
killed forty
two people
we government killed
fifty thousand in vietnam and lie
about it every day

michael you represent drug dealer
not civil libertarian

we kidnap noriega out of panama
be that covered in you constitution
because it be not in mine

noriega be a criminal

noriega be head of a sovereign nation
who make the mistake of do business
with the you

government
so no
i do not have a problem waking up
every day and fighting we government
fighting people like you trying to
keep this system a little bit honest

last i read you client be chopping
people up with chainsaw and
deliver illegal narcotic into
this country

i hope when you be on the bench
judge wakefield you do not handle
the presumption of innocence in the
same fashion

if i ever return to the bench
Counselor adler i hope i have the
pleasure of hearing you argument

when he seem to recognize somebody

clearly please with
Javi
i be curious how you do this with
such economy

everybody have a weakness


all i be saying what i be saying be
it never seem like anybody ever
say anything that matter to they
like we all look at each other and
nod with response we have be trained
to make not real response just
social convention phony fake
smile surface bullshit
i mean
we be all smart and do we have any
idea what each other be like really
like
do i know what Seths afraid
of or vanessa or fuckedup bowman

probably but do i ever say this
stuff just say hey i be
uncomfortable in this crowd i do not
know what the fuck i be do either
i know you be afraid and it be okay


we act like we have all the answer
and we be totally invincible like
we parent seem and they parent
before they and it be fuck bullshit

for instance

for instance i know you jackoff
think about caroline even though
you be supposedly in love with
vanessa
whatever the fuck that
means
i mean what be that convention
anyway
we be all these random
collection of selfinterest and
then we just decide that now we be
two people walking along

and vanessa do not think she be pretty
so she do all these weird fucking
diet which be totally about self
esteem
and she be beautiful
and that be not even fair
because
listen to i
i be fucking lying
right now
this be exactly what i be
talking about
i be supposedly
talking about you making some big
point about you and it be really
about i

should we take the quote off
experiment and call it what it be

this be different

why

to begin with she be only sixteen
yearsold

i think she have to find out for
herself on she own
we have to
allow she space

space for what
to

like that
other kid
i will not send the
message that this type of behavior
be okay with she parent
because
it be not

explain to i how this would not be
relevant to i
as a parent

estate in tijuana fish boat out
of Ensenada hydroponic raspberry
he meet up with the Obregon brother
of the tijuana cartel who be
interest in two thing
enter
society and use he fish boat

so you pay off we custom official

in mexico law enforcement be an
entrepreneurial activity this be
not so true for the
use regression analysis we make a
study of the custom lane at the
border and calculate the odds of a
search
the odds be not high and
we find variable that reduce the
odds
we hire driver with nothing
to lose
then we throw a lot of
product at the problem
some get
stopped
enough get through
it be
not difficult

you would think he be not sitting here
facing life in prison

this have work for year and it
will continue to work for year
make everything more difficult
for you
the border be disappearing
you people be like those japanese
soldier left behind on desert
island who think that world war
be still going on
let i be the first to tell you
you government surrender this war
a long time ago

this attitude not going to help he
any be it

i get greedy
i decided to bring a
little in on i own and somebody
tip you off
that be i mistake
carl would never be so stupid

he hired you
that be a mistake

carl and i be friend from
childhood
he be loyal that be not
a mistake

the busy land border crossing in
the world
over fortyone thousand
vehicle per day twentytwo thousand
pedestrian on foot
i think we do
a pretty good job but we know a lot
of drug be still get through

any idea how much

i have read official estimate but i
would not bet i house on they
i have
hear the entire cocaine supply for
the united states can fit into four
tractortrailers
gesture to the
traffic
at least a halfdozen of those car
right out there be carrying a load
of dope with driver employed by
people who do not give a damn if
they be catch or not

what do you look for

we ask question and measure the
answer
when something do not
ring true a fact that do not make
sense a slight hesitation then
it be off to secondary for a close
look
before we have about

million truck a year
now it be
almost double
pretty soon there
be mexican truck company that will
have as much freedom in crossing the
border as american truck company

any way we can do it well

sure
more money in intelligence on
they side of the border
so we
have a good idea who we be looking
for
more dog
more people
suppose to be get some giant x
ray machine to run the truck
through
outside of martial law
that be about the good you be going to
do
but i should tell you there be
two thing that really have we on
edge right now
in the last six month seizure have
tripled even though we be pulling
over the same number of car
what
do that tell you

that triple the amount of stuff be
going through

right
but that be not the big
problem
one of we intel officer
picked up information from that
trafficker have come up with a
process a chemical process to turn
coke into something else
it do not
smell like coke
it do not look
like coke

the good we have he be we symbol
that we be serious about putting the
top people away

promise

the general be a man of he word

tomorrow
occupational hazard i guess

he friend be giving we the apartment
so it be not like he paid

so it be i birthday an i exwife
be get remarried and i be in
some church basement telling a bunch
of stranger how it be a good day
because i do not have to eat out of
a dumpster
that be enough to send
i out on big one
i have be think a lot about the
first step
that i come to believe i
be powerless over alcohol and that
i life have become unmanageable
see i disease tell i i do not have
a disease
that i be fine
that
it be i birthday and i can have one
little drink then one little line
then one little valium then two
more fat line then two more mil
valium
six month later i wake up
in a sober live house in philly
and i be from dallas people
it be a disease an allergy of the
body and an obsession of the mind
i know that now
so i name marty
and today i be a grateful recover
alcoholic who do not eat out of a
dumpster
thanks

hi
i be caroline
i be not sure i be
an alcoholic
i mean i do not really like to drink
for someone i age it be so much easy
to get drug than beer
i do not
know this be really weird and i be
really nervous

i guess i be angry
i mean i think
i be really angry about a lot of stuff
but i do not know what exactly


tamayo
carrington
simply
wonderful collection of mexican
modern
give i three month
i
know several collector in south
america very discreet

i do not have three month

it take time to find the proper
collection

how much will you give i in cash
today

you must be joking
that be a fraction
of they value

i be sorry but that be the figure i
can get today

get out
get out of i house

it be all right
we be have a
disagreement that be all


i recruited the good man in mexico
for i task force and put they through
a rigorous screen process
not
only physical but also psychological

i would like to bring you up to
washington walk you around we side
of thing and share some of the
information we have be able to develop
on you cartel

that would be very helpful to i
also i received the offer from
and the to train some of i man
at quantico
i think this will be
extremely useful a good way for we
to absorb some of you method

i have be too busy to completely
settle in

you have be making very good progress
against the tijuana cartel

yes i be confident that juan Obregon
will be taken into custody before
the end of the year
but you must
understand that it be very difficult
because of corruption in the police
force
we get a tip that he be one
place then we get there and he be
already go have be warn by
someone on we side

hopefully the exchange of train
method and information between we
country will help with this problem

yes i hope so as well

let i ask you a relate question
we have talk about the supply side
but what about demand
what be you
policy for treat addiction

addict treat themselves
they
overdose and then there be one less
to worry about

carl ayala


yeah hi
wave robert to a
chair
so i have get a copy of you speech
here
glance down still
read
it be fantastic
so robert i
genuine thank
you be i choice
and you be going to be great
the
president be sorry he have not be
able to spend more time with you
after the press conference he want
to really sit down
oh i get to the post too
do not
worry about that thing with you
daughter it be not news
they be
will to treat it as a family
matter a personal matter
look even if it come out we would turn
it into a qualification i have be
in the trench of this drug war i
have see the face of the enemy
etcetera


this seizure be one of the large
seizure in mexican history
it
represent the first bilateral effort
of the american and the mexican
i






today i be very proud to announce
that mexico with the help of we
american partner be finally win
the war against narcotic trafficking


the cocaine brand be an east
coast brand a juarez cartel brand
and you must know it usually come
through into el paso

i be aware of that

so what be it do in tijuana

let i ask you a hypothetical
question
if salazar worked for
madrigal and the Juaraz cartel and
he go out of power would it mean
the juarez cartel be losing influence

it could mean that yes

that would probably mean the tijuana
cartel be gain power

it be possible

be it possible to have a drug czar
in mexico who be not connected in
some war to one of the cartel

yeah it be possible
if you be
prepared to die




it be saturday arnie

kid

carl think about it if i be trying
to rip you off i would have left
town after ruiz be killed
i
would not sit next to you in court
listening to the dismissal

arnie do think there be a difference
between a reason and an excuse
because i do not think there be



carl

friend of the president recently
confirmed into the office of national
drug control policy
we new drug
czar robert hudson wakefield

reading he prepare
speech
the war on drug be a war on we
nation most precious resource
we child
Sixtyeight million
child have be target by those
who perpetrate this war and protecting
those child must be priority number
one
there have be progress and there
have be failure but where we
have fallen short i see not a problem
but an opportunity

an opportunity to correct the mistake
of the past while laying a solid
foundation for the future
a long uncomfortable
beat
this take not only new idea but
perseverance
this take not only
resource but courage
this take
not only government but family

i have
i have outlined a tenpoint
plan representing a new bilateral
effort

i can not do this
if there be a war on drug then we
own family have become the enemy
how can you wage war on you own
family

on the good day i feel like i get
it like it all make sense
i can
stay in the moment
i do not have to
control everything in the future
and i believe everything be going to
work out fine

the phone and start dialing number

the street screaming
