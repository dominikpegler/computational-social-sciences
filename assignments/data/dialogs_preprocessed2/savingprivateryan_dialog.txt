steelgray eye and a roughhewn
but handsome face i be from colorado
i father a mining engineer do not
you take note

he and he two brother get a
ministry the blessed church of the
wander gospel

in west fork

in the back of a nineteen and thirty
one stretch hudson with a big oleo
trailer

no kid

i do not make joke about thing of
or related to the preach of the
holy gospel including the ministerial
calling of i family

so they travel around from place to
place and preach

we get we a tent fortytwo foot
across eighteen foot at center

a hasset county and most a weller
county

where be he
from

you figure that out you get yourself
one nice prize

wade company get a pool
five buck get you in whoever
guess where the captain from and
what he do as a civilian get it
all

the whole kit and caboodle

but everybody hear of he he win
the congressional medal of honor he
saved a dozen man

we know

somebody must know where he be from
what he do for a live

somebody probably do

why do not you just ask he

the captain prefer not to discuss
certain aspect of he life in
particular everything up to and
including he enlistment in the united
states army

i have be with he since anzio
i be
closer to he that i be to i own
brother but i do not even know what
state he be from
somewhere in the
northeast as near as i can figure
i do not even have a clue what he do
for a live as civilian

no one going to win the money for the
simple reason that the captain never
be a civilian
they assembled he
at


out of spare body part
from dead
i
s
i know this for a
fact

you get something against the Capn

hell no
i think he be the good
officer in the whole goddamned army
bar none

you get that right

captain i foot be most
uncomfortable
if i would a known we
be going to have to walk all the way
to Ramelle i never would a
volunteer for this here mission

you do not volunteer jackson

i most likely would have sir have i
be given the opportunity

if we find ryan and he be still alive
that sonofabitch be going to carry
this goddamned


back to the
beach for i

army life be too dang easy i foot

convinced himself he be on a cruise
ship going to tahiti he have he
own cabin first class with room
service

the weather be always lousy so he
never bothered to go up on deck
happy guy you ever see until the

a pack full of feather and goddamned
private james ryan can carry i
fuck gear

Reiben you can be very unpleasant
to be around sometimes

you want unpleasant

dollar to see that bastard ryan
crawl on he belly over an acre of
break glass to hear i greataunt

thanks

let we find someplace to hole up

sir i be sorry about what happen
i

it be nothing

but you could have get killed and
i

like i said it be nothing
do not bunch up

do you see what he do back there
he stepped right into the open so i
could get across

shit that be no big deal

they can not kill he

like hell they can not

wade right it be some kind of
scientific magnetic thing i can not
explain it but i have see it

we all have he be get nine live or
he be bulletproof or some damn thing

no one bulletproof
no one
mon stay low

captain could you please explain
the math of this mission to i

sure what do you want to know

well sir in purely arithmetic term
since when do six equal one
what be
the sense in risking six guy to
save one

ours be not to reason why

huh

never mind do not worry we will pick
up this kid hightail it back to
division everything work out
fine

i would much rather die in caen than
Ramelle sir
it be a personal thing

Reiben there be a fairly good chance
you be not going to die at all

easy for you to say sir
fucking james ryan i would like to wring
he fuck neck

jesus Reiben think of the poor
bastard mother

hey i get a mother
jackson you
get a mother

last i know

wade sarge corporal insect all of
we hell i will bet even the captain
have a mother

well maybe not the captain but the
rest of we have mother

you have order too

sir i have an opinion on this matter

i would love to hear it

seem to i Capn this mission be
a serious misallocation of valuable
military resource
miller go on

well sir by i way a thinkin i be
a finely make instrument of warfare
what i mean by that be if you be
to put i with this here sniper rifle
anywhere up to and includin one
mile from adolf hitler with a clear
line of sight ware over

Reiben i want you to listen closely
to jackson
this be the way to gripe
jackson continue

yes sir
it seem to i sir that
the entire resource of the united
states army oughta be dedicated to
one thing and one thing only and
that be to put i and this here weapon
on a rooftop smackdab in the middle
of berlin germany
now i be not one
to question decision make up on
high sir but it seem to i that
saving one private no matter how
grievous the loss of he family
be a waste of i Godgiven talent

wade

hell i do not mind this mission
sir as long as there be something up
at Ramelle for

finish wade
sentence
for you to blow up yeah yeah
we hear that

upham

pass

sarge

i be just here to keep a bunch of
numbnuts including one certain
frequently suicidal tempteroffate
from get themselves killed

and what about you captain

Reiben what be the matter with you
i do not gripe to you
i be a captain
there be a chain of command
gripe
go one way up only up never
down
you gripe to i i gripe to
i superior officer
up get it
i do not gripe to you i do not gripe
in front of you
how long you be
in the army

i be sorry sir i apologize
but if you be not a captain or if
i be a major what would you say

in that case i would say this be an
excellent mission with an extremely
valuable objective worthy of i
good effort

in addition as i pointed out early
i have a fondness for cheese and i
hope to have the opportunity to sample
some of the Ramelle product when
we arrive there to see if they live
up to they excellent reputation
moreover i feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of private james ryan
and i be more than will to lay
down i life and the live of i
man especially you Reiben to help
relieve she suffer
the man
thoroughly enjoy the performance

sir if you be not a captain i
would compliment you now for be
an excellent liar

but i be a captain
if i be not a
captain i would thank you for the
compliment and tell you that the
ability to lie come from be a
topnotch poker player which i be
have learned at the side of i
mother who be by popular acclaim
the good poker player in

i home town which shall remain
unnamed

any far thought on the subject

yes sir as a final note i would like
to say fuck we order fuck Ramelle
fuck the cheese capital of france
and while we be at it fuck private
james ryan

i will make a note of you suggestion
but i will leave that last one to you

jackson Reiben

keep you eye open
i be going to recon

what be the name of that kid at
anzio the one who get he face burned
off

vecchio

yeah vecchio i could not remember
he name he be a good kid remember
how he used to walk on he hand and
sing that song about the man on flying
trapeze

yeah

you know why i be such a good officer
because of i mother
have i ever
told you about she

bit and piece

she be the good poker player you ever
see
i father used to go to these
saturday night game and lose his
shirt
finally i mother give he
an ultimatum either she get a
regular seat at the table or she
lock he in every saturday night
he squawk and so do he buddy
but after a while they give in and
from the first night she sit down
she never lost
she could read those
cocky bastard like they be playing
open hand
and he bluff
he have
sixteen level of bullshit
she
eye the tone of she voice she
bet she joke the way she sip
she coffee she be a master
she
win more money on shit hand than
anyone in the history of the game
every saturday night i father would
lose two three hundred buck and
she would win it all back and then some
and i would stand there glue to she
shoulder from the time i be five
year old watch every hand every
move study how she do it
that be why i be such a good officer
i can look at a mane face and tell
you exactly what he be holding and
if it be a shit hand i know just
what card to deal he

and what about you own hand

no problem
pair of deuce
less
so what
i bluff
it used to tear
i apart when i would get one of i man
killed but what be i suppose to
do
break down in front of the one
who be standing there waiting for
i to tell they what to do
of course
not so i bluff and after a while
i start to fall for i own bluff
it be great it make everything so
much easy
sarge be that why you
hand be shaking

it could be bad
you know the
first thing they teach you at


lie to you man

oh yeah

not in so many word but they tell
you you can have all the firepower
in the world and if you man do not
have good morale it be not worth a
damn
so if you be scare or empty
or halfastep from a section eight
do you tell you man
of course
not
you bluff you lie

and how do you bluff yourself

simple number
every time you
kill one of you man you tell
yourself you just saved the live of
two three ten a hundred other
we lost what thirtyone on the
cliff
i will bet we saved ten time
that number by putting out those
gun
that be over three hundred
man
maybe five hundred
thousand
then thousand
any number you want
see
it be simple
it let we you always
choose mission over man

except this time the mission a
man

that be the rub
i liked wade
who be
ryan
if they be both standing in
front of i and i have to shoot one
or the other how do i choose
look
at i hand there it go again

john i have get to tell you i think
you be about used up

i think you be right keith

you want i to take over

no but if i get any bad you will
have to relieve i

just what i want to do

you know wade be the eleventh of
the twelve you be the last one still
alive

i know

do not let yourself get killed if
you do they might make i give back
the medal and then i will not be able
to lip off to colonel anymore

i will do i good
ah forget it

thanks for draw that machine gun
off i

you be welcome john

but that be i personal brand of
stupidity i feel kind of proprietary
about it if you do it again you be
bust

yes sir

up
we be moving out

i think you said we have an hour
sir

well now i be saying we be moving
out
get off you ass

what the hello the matter with you
jackson

sir i be not feeling so chipper on
account of wade

who be wade

i said who the hell be wade

sir i understand what you be do
but i respectfully request permission
to grieve in i own manner

you will grieve the way i tell you to
goddamned grieve
there be no wade
there be one but he die a long
time ago he be be dead for so long
you can hardly remember he name
you understand

sir i understand
i do not like it
but i understand

good now get you goddamned gear

you know what the good possible thing
that could happen be

yep you step on a rusty nail get
lockjaw never say another word as
long as you live

i have given this a lot of thought
sir
the good thing that could happen
be we find ryan and he be dead

why be that

well sir consider the possibility

ryan be alive
we have to take
he back to the beach
knowing you
you do not let he carry i gear
even though he really should and we
all get killed trying to keep he
alive

except for the last part that one
not bad


ryan be dead
he be be blown
up by the german equivalent of wade
whose name i know you do not want i
to mention
there be nothing to find
the big piece be the size of a
pea
we wander around looking for
he until the german pick we off
one after another

i do not like that one

neither do i sir

and this be
the bad one we find ryan and he be
wound
not only do he not carry
i gear we have to carry he gear
and he

but we accomplish the mission

maybe
but what if he die on the
way back
you see what i be saying
sir
the good possible situation
be he be dead we find he body
more or less intact we grab one of
he dogtags and hightail it back
to the beach or well yet we head
over to caen and catch up with
division

have anyone ever told you you be
officer material

no sir

that be a mystery to i

look like we be going to beat those
kraut company to Ramelle

i do not think so

hurry along the field on either
side of the road trying to keep up
with the vehicle

catch a glimpse of an approaching
german flank squad
they flatten
themselves into the mucky water
ready they weapon
prepare to
fire

approach the bridge

be just about to open up on they

see he flank squad lagging behind
and to they

obey
hurry after the rest of the
convoy

the american breathe again

i wonder where they be going

same place we be

scan the german with he binoculars

look like tea time maybe they be
brit

i sure hope so

what do you think they be waiting
for captain

put away the binoculars and jerk
he head for he man to follow low
along the wall
the man be happy
to do so looking back nervously at
the german tank

look like they have be have a
hell of a party here captain


we be



i will




i


cover i

what if we guy open up sir

you be only allow to shoot at
german that be one of the rule

have it you way captain

at the german position


the paratrooper pour a
at the german position

i will keep it in mind


thing be tough all over

looking for a private james ryan

be he here
what do you want he for sir

jackson get a hold of command

how many man do you have

dashing from cover to cover making
he way toward they
ryan be an
american classic nineteen year
old earthy handsome sharp cocky
though he be exhausted unshaven and
smeared with dirt and blood he be
very alive
he eye shine his
face have a spark
you can not help
but love this kid

all watch ryan run toward they

so that be ryan

look like a flaming asshole to i

the
german have two company less than
three mile from here

lot more important than he be

Capn

seem to i we get we a opportunity
here to kill two bird with one
stone
command seem to think keepin
this boy alive be worth something
if we be to do that and hold this

like you get so be i could sass any
officer in the whole dang army you
