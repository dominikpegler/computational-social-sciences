young brother be wounded in afghanistan a
war without hero
i would get out of military
service due to a heart problem it be not
completely a lie

impossibly uppercrust british
accent
finally in response to human right
protest and in an effort to encourage the
united states to sell grain to the soviet
union after two successive crop failure it
be report that the politburo have consent
to permit a limit number of jew to
emigrate from the soviet union to israel
and that conclude this edition of news from
the world service

trading jew for grain

it be good

for the moscow olympic

good for the jew

and we

after colombia i become a onemanoperation
sole proprietor as you say on you tax
return that be if you be foolish enough to
fill one out



by then i would master i craft
selling arm
be not so different to selling vacuum
cleaner
you advertise pound the
pavement take order



of course a good arm dealer also have to be
a political scientist
i go by a sevenstep
approach



one
identity a government and an opposition
where the opposition be ignore



two
wait for a radical group to break away
from the opposition



three
immediately approach the radical
group and offer they arm



four
whether they buy or not inform the
government that the radical group approach
you and offer the government arm



five
whether they buy or not reapproach
the radical group and offer they more arm
but now at a high price
increase
tension be a means of generate demand and
the ideal situation be to sell to both
side



six
if they start shooting at each other
the escalation be underway



they be consume small arm and ammunition
and the cash register be well and truly
ring



seven
do not forget that the success of a
radical group in one country can inspire a
radical group in a neighboring country

there be really no one else you would consider
christie and brooke be both available
not
the right look
it be just that ava do not
generally do print

however since you be will to double she
rate and pay cash in advance
she love

will only be see in asia

destination

in the meantime why do not i take you
picture

relationship be found on lie and
deceit
since that be where they usually end
up anyway it be a logical place to start



i nearly go broke trying to convince she i
be anything but
i know ava be not the
kind of woman to be seduce by a ride in a
private jet unless you owned the jet

and an engagement ring

what

this
tell i that i be everything you
despise that i be the personification of
evil that i be responsible for the breakdown
of the social fabric of society and world
order that i be a one man genocide
say
everything you want to say to i now
because you do not have long

be you not paying attention or be you
delusional
you have broken every arm
embargo written
there be enough in those
briefcase to buy you consecutive life
sentence
you will spend ten year going
from a cell to a courtroom before you even
start do you time

you do not seem to fully appreciate the
seriousness of you situation

snap back he emotion
finally showing
i family have disown i
i wife and son
have left i
i brother be dead
trust
i i fully appreciate the seriousness of i
situation
but i promise you i will not spend
a single second in a courtroom

you be delusional

i like you jack
well maybe not
but i
understand you
you feel you loyalty to
you badge have finally be rewarded
but
you have not count on the people who give
you that badge

let i tell you what be going to happen so
you can prepare yourself

soon there be going to be a knock on that
door and you be going to be called outside



in the hall there will be a man who
outrank you



first he will compliment you on the fine
job you have do how you be making the world
a safe place and then he be going to tell
you that i be to be released



you be going to protest you will probably
threaten to resign



but in the end i will be released

the reason i will be released be the same
reason you think i will be convicted
i do
rub shoulder with the most vile sadistic
man calling themselves leader today
but some of those man be the enemy of
you enemy

and while the big arm dealer in the world
be you boss the president of the united
states who ship more merchandise in a day
than i do in a year sometimes it be
embarrass to have he fingerprint on the
gun
sometimes he need a freelancer like i
to supply opposition force he can not be see
supplying

unfortunately for you i be a necessary evil

i would tell you to go to hell
but i think
you be already there

what if i sleep fine at
night
what if i sleep good than you
i
think that be what truly scare you



most people be happy just to get out of
jail
i expect to be paid to leave



i be not a fool
i know that just because they
need i one day do not mean they will not make
i a scapegoat the next
but i be back do
what i do best

sun umbrella

have a safe trip

for someone who be never fired a gun or be
in a battle i have suffer many
casualty in i life
i guess that be how i
survive
i never go to war

especially with myself
