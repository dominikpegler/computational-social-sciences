he have a strong sense that he
and lucy be from very different world and walk to he car
with an uneasy sense of relief to be get away

be back on the early morning watch
black car draw
up and lean out

angel and i kiss the hem of you
garment but why can not you get
here on time for the love of
fuck

oh

england too
she look at he in surprise
she look sedate not quite
there
leap protectively to she defence

marilyn have to prepare properly
she have to find in herself all
that lie under the surface
act be not just a case of
putting on a costume or some
ludicrous false nose
give she a freeze look then take marilyns
hand leading she forward like a child

you must apologise to dame sybil
redden with humiliation as he take she arm

propel towards

redden with humiliation

i be sorry

yourself

you have many other thing on she
mind
radiant smile spread slowly across marilyns face as the
old woman word sink in

you think i be a great actress


none of the rest of we truly know
how to act for the camera
but
you do
it be a rare gift
she look sharply at

this poor girl have not have you
year of experience
she be in a
strange country acting a strange
part
now be you helping or
bully
look aghast at be so roundly rebuke

look on startle

and the editor
watch rush
lurk about unnoticed at the back
they
watch one of OLIVIERs speech from the the coconut
girl sequence we see film in scene and
he be
dry and clip every take precise and professional
it be
an effective but theatrical performance
sneak in with
they sit in the back
row watch she performance from the same scene
she
fluff take after take get she word wrong and pause
looking daze
notice she clutch miller hand
tightly
but finally a good take come up
she be charming
and natural and she performance suddenly make OLIVIERs
look stiff and clumsy
smile in relief and
reassurance

that one pretty damn good
you
knock it out of the park
glow at he praise

when marilyn get it right you
just do not want to look at anyone
else
frown
for all he greatness as an actor he will
never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
marilyn
and the injustice of it be like a stab through his
heart
at the back only have eye for the screen
he watch
marilyns image enthral
until now he have taken marilyn
entirely at Oliviers valuation but as he watch she on
screen he begin to see thing differently

he sneak a look at she in real life
she be holding
miller hand tightly looking tense and vulnerable as one
disastrous take follow another

why not only show she the good
take
then she might feel good
about herself
he look selfconscious as they both turn to stare at he

the kid right
she could use
the confidence

i believe it be traditional for
the producer of the film to watch
rush
besides she be an
experience actress
she should
learn from she mistake

they just upset she

not half as much as they upset
i

hurry across the stage carrying a fresh carton of
Oliviers
stop he

i will do that
you go and find
marilyns script

burst into the dressing room without knocking
clothes be strew carelessly all over the floor
there be
pill bottle full and empty on every surface along with
empty bottle of champagne and bunch of flower

rummage around on the table moving pile of script and
book
no luck
he walk casually through the halfopen
door into the inner chamber
and stop dead in he track
stand by a chair a towel wrapped around she head
she be completely naked
she look at he in astonishment
he stare back equally astounded
he see she script heavily covered in handwritten note
lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and
a bottle of pill

calmly she take the towel from she hair and wrap it
around herself
she smile quizzically

he hesitate a beat surprise that she know he name
before he fumble for the door



slam the door aghast

and be buried in the clothes rack kiss
passionately
they surface for air

david want to know if you be
ready for the extra in the
ballroom scene


tell he he can start sending
they up
woman first
they kiss again
he pull away

and sit in the back

it be very quiet in the normally busy west end
shop have

he head in daze horror as slump halfcollapsed
into the seat beside he

madness
Someones going to get
hurt
shift he gaze to she in the mirror and he eye
meet marilyns
he see or imagine a terrible sadness
before she quickly replace she dark glass

stand silently by the camera watch and
in character as elsie marina and
northbrook open the door of the grand duke draw
room

stricken paula

i do not get it
he be such a
strange man
i think she would figure
out he only invited she to sleep
with she

the reason marilyn can not remember
the line be because she do not
believe the situation she character
be in

then she should pretend to
believe it

pretend
we be talking about the
difference between the truth and
artificial crap

we be in absolute agreement
paula
act be all about
sincerity
and if you can fake
that you be off to the race


maybe we should try for another
take

marilyn need time to give a
great performance
you should
give she as long as it take
chaplin take eight month to make
a movie

eight month of this
i would rather
kill myself

i can not do this

can hardly
bear to look
everyone hold they breath

well we be still the first one

there be a stun moment
gape and look
around uncertainly
do she say it

frantically from behind the camera that she should carry
on
she hesitate
there be an agonise beat
and then she panic and bolt for the side of the set

paula

set lowering he voice trying to conceal he exasperation
with a honeyed tone

kind of nonsense at the
hippodrome in eastbourne

you have to be patient with she

trying to teach marilyn how to

instead he pick
up he bag and open it
it be stuffed with bottle of
pill

in he pocket

strip of light from the door disappear leaving the hall
in darkness

give she a few minute

she can not hide in she bloody

look at he angrily
he be close to the end of he

wait a moment then open the door wide

come in
marilyn want to see

the dressing room be in semidarkness
settle down in the corner
lie on a sofa
wearing a bathrobe she face in shadow
pill bottle be
scattered across the dresser at she elbow
there be a long
pause
she sigh softly

how old be you


nearly

you remind we of the young king in
the movie
kind of honest and
innocent

i be not innocent
she turn she head and she beautiful face come fully into

but
then suddenly she turn back to he she eye huge

vulnerable in the shadowy light
there be only one answer

he be suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy

on she side now

as walk down through the studio he meet
with on they way to wardrobe

wink at he

he give a camp laugh
try to shrug it off with a
lightness he do not feel

at least
plenty of time for a
kiss and a cuddle


paula be with we the whole time

the mind boggle dear
smile but he expression freeze as he look up to
see nearby
she have hear every word of the exchange

be finally back on the set film a solo dance
routine
release from the need to remember any word she
take refuge in the physical activity undulating sexily in
she tight white dress in a performance which be gawky
mildly silly and charming all at the same time
the dance be deliberately a little amateurish
elsie marina
be not mean to be any sort of superstar
but she radiate
joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance and
capture all this perfectly
within the scene the
actor playing nicky watch from the
doorway
everyone watch silently from behind the camera
no one
can look away least of all
it feel like one purely
joyful moment in the agony the film have become and marilyn
be radiant
even have a reluctant halfsmile on his
face as he watch

the stage be empty except for and
they sit
in a pool of light in the cavernous room
pour
whisky for they and then step back into the shadow
both
man ignore he
he be too unimportant to worry about
lean forward holding he pipe but not smoking it

i dream last night i could hear
sing
and then i realise it
be not a dream
there be a male
voice choir serenade marilyn
under we window

she think i could smash all she
insecurity with one magical
stroke
that i could make she a
new person

she want i to protect she but i
can not
i can not even protect
myself
she read some
note i make

bride and all that

everyone from the low chippie to the head of
department with the same flirtatious grace
walk
at she elbow
the crew crowd around she
she be easy and
relaxed relish every second of they attention

i hope larry be not making you all
work too hard

dreadful slave driver he can be

she move on to
the light cameraman looking at he in mock
misery

vivien
she laugh and turn to looking at he severely

now you be looking after larry
like i told you

glance away to see standing nearby awkward
and excluded
she have come straight from makeup and wear
only a towelling robe slipper and curler in she hair

compare to she look frumpish
glide
towards she hand extended

darling marilyn
she kiss she on both cheek and hold she hand

larry tell i you be quite
quite superb
i be wild with
jealousy

oh but everyone say you be a
wonderful elsie on stage

but i be too old to play she in
the film
larry be quite brutal
about that
you see the truth be
all that matter to he

much
she glance at with a fluttering laugh
he smile
back with a haunt look in he eye

now i must let you work
i only
come to wish you good luck
goodbye everyone
the crew press around she
watch feeling more
than ever the odd one out
watch she from the edge
of the crowd
she cut a lonely vulnerable figure
he be
totally preoccupy with she so much so that when
come up behind he he turn guiltily as though catch out
stare at he
all she exuberance have vanished and
she look suddenly tire and old
it as though the facade
of a beautiful build be beginning to crack
she gaze at
he with bitter disappointment

oh colin
not you too
he want to protest but be already turning away



push open the door to the projection booth
the
screen be light up with the rush of the scene in the prince
and the showgirl where a startlingly beautiful in
gorgeous closeup eat caviar and drink champagne in a
toast to the american president


i do not think she would be so
beautiful
she
shine on that
screen

you should not upset yourself
you
be ten time the actress she
will ever be

if you could see yourself
the
way you watch she

there be never be anything
between marilyn and i

only because she do not want you

do you think i be a fool
you
do not think the little tart
could resist the great laurence
olivier

but she see through you do not she

would fall shatteringly in love
with marilyn

woman you be never too old for
humiliation

the set be dressed and the crew be waiting but once again
there be no sign of marilyn
the actor and
amongst they sit apathetically in full
costume while stand with he arm folded
technician chat or sit idly
as watch

friendly way as they walk

elia kazan
it be all too new and
strange
you be the future and

that magnificent face be i own
inadequacy

despite she behaviour
she have taken everything
hollywood can throw at she and
triumph


an actress have to be pretty tough
to get even a tenth as far as she

need to be rescue

then fold the pillow over he head in a desperate attempt to

he smile look at she just once more and then go out
as the door close we see marilyns smile fade to be
replace by a bleak frighten expression


sit in front of he makeup mirror in he grand
ducal uniform smooth down he hair with pomade

knock and come in

there be a
flurry of activity and emerge with on one
side and on the other
she look exactly as marilyn
should
with she white dress shimmer in the light and she
platinum blonde hair glowing she have the air of a goddess
she sweep past only inch away from colin but ignore he
he can not help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret


i hope you will all forgive i
it

i would like you to remember i tried

in character lie back on a sofa with on

yours no matter what other may say
or do
be light of heart and fancy
free that be the way to start
there will be nothing to lose till

she sing with touch delicacy nail it perfectly
there
be pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch
be
amongst they
it be a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
for he
he suddenly realise that have creep
up silently behind he to watch the scene
as he turn to she
she smile with infinite wisdom and compassion murmur
softly so that only he can hear

first love be such sweet despair
colin
she touch he cheek gently and smile perhaps lost in a
long ago memory of she own before retreating quietly into
the darkness at the back of the set
inch by laborious inch the sleep prince move towards the
finish line
we see a montage of scene be film
enter as major domo through the main door of the
oval room carrying a silver tray bearing shaving
equipment
and crossing the draw room to the
grand duke bedroom
cross the draw room and knock on a door
the process be hardly any easy but somehow the work be
do until we come to the final shot in the sequence

indulgently

the crew shake hand and clap each other on the back like a
group of hardened war veteran
offer a
grudging nod well donee

a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent
on for a long moment gazing at she image in the
darkness then
the circus be leaving

not knowing
he next job sit suitcase next to he chair wearing
the marilyn experience on he face and in he soul

he get into the car and we stay on as he
watch it pull away
come to the doorway of the pub

be that really marilyn monroe


no just a good friend of mine
walk back into the pub leaving alone stare
at the vanish car
and then the sun swallow it as it
drive into the english countryside

walk along chatting to friend
dress in a neat
dark suit he look old and more confident
there be
little sign left of the callow young man who pace up and
down the pavement outside sir laurence Oliviers office
we see the caption

walk into a small office
film can be pile up all
over the floor and book and paper spill off the shelf
sit typing at she desk
go to he own
desk glance at he diary then look up

any message
push a piece of paper at he

it be probably just someone have
a joke
look down at the message
there be a los angeles
phone number and then the name marilyn monroe

do she say anything


she just ask you to call
it be a joke be not it
stare down at the paper

probably
book a call as
soon as you can
los angeles
california
brentwood

it be late
stare at the number on the scrap of
paper
the phone ring
he pick it up eagerly

you call to los angeles
we hear the crackle of the international line
he wait
anxiously as the ring continue


the luxurious exterior of marilyns comfortable
brentwood house


the room be large and tasteful white sofa and cushion
and deep rug
picture window look out onto the hollywood
hill
white phone ring on the table
it ring continuously insistently
it carry on ring
no one come
on the jangle phone
each time it ring we think
marilyn might appear but she never do
it carry on ringing unanswered in the empty room
as
the picture fade we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
echo of marilyns voice singing the sleep prince waltz


i find a dream and lay in you
arm the whole night through i be
yours no matter what other may
say or do
be light of heart and
fancy free that be the way to
start there will be nothing to
lose till you lose you heart

the fragile voice hang in the air for a second then slowly
drift away to nothing
sit with the phone to he ear
the sound of marilyn
singing the sleep prince waltz die away and we realise
have be revisit it in he memory
he wait as long as he can but it be obvious no one be going
to answer
in the end he put the receiver back in it cradle
in resignation
he gaze drift up to a shelf stacked with film can
he
stand up and look through they blowing dust away
they
have be here for a long time ignore
he find the one he
be looking for it say simply on the can
he take the short reel of film and thread it through a
Movieola in the corner of the room
he turn it on and bend
to look
the screen burst into life with an image of at she
most vital and captivating
it be a copy of some rush from
the prince and the showgirl perhaps given to colin by
olivier or perhaps borrow as a souvenir and long since
forgotten
we see dancing happily exaggerate off camera
looking playful and sexy
she be radiant and full of life
after a moment she turn and look off camera perhaps to
where colin himself would have be standing and wink
happily
blown up to the full size of the screen it be utterly sweet
and charming
there be something so completely natural about the gesture
feel he have be sweep back seven year in time and
be standing in front of he again in the flesh
it
move and delight he
perhaps he have never even really see
this clip before
at any rate he have not think about it for
year
it be as he will always remember she relax
affectionate and vital a part of she however tiny forever
he
she smile laugh at something giggle in delight without
sound
she say something to an unseen crew member then
look back smile at the camera
