Gendarmeria Vaticano

vatican police

another letter
i request for access to the archive

should not you be in rome
busy time
for you guy

in fact i be in new york on
vacation
i get a call in the
middle of the night find robert
langdon
matter of great urgency

urgent vatican business involve i
i doubt that

they said to show you this

llluminati


yes of course but it could not be
the llluminati as we know they they
disappeared a hundred year ago


do they
look at the paper

i have see it

look again

turn it upside down

it be called an ambigram the same
backwards and forwards
that be common
in a symbol like a jewish star or
yinyang or a swastika but this be a
word
people have search for the
llluminati ambigrammatic symbol for
four century modern symbologists
even tried to create it but nobody
could pull it off not even by
computer
most have conclude it be a
myth
i write a book about it
which be why you be here be not it

the art of the llluminati by robert
langdon












i be not under the impression that
episode have endear i to the
vatican

oh it do not
but it make you
what be the word
formidable
formidable
plane
be standing by twenty minute from
here
will you come with i

professor langdon you have spent ten
year of you academic life searching
for the very symbol you now hold in
you hand
and the madman who
created it or who know the secret
of it origin that person be in rome
how much longer must we pretend you
have not already decided to come


if the llluminati have return and
be in rome we will hunt they down
and kill they

spoken like a roman catholic


the llluminati do not become violent
antiPapists until the th century
initially they be physicist
mathematician astronomer
they
name mean the enlightened one
in
the s they start meet
secretly to share they concern about
the church inaccurate teaching
they be dedicated to the quest for
scientific truth
and for that the
church to use you word hunt
they down and killed they
drive
they underground

into a secret society


and


Commandante rocher assure i the
guard be do everything humanly
possible to find the prefiriti

very long way for he to say very
little


what if you be to begin in they
absence

they be the four lead candidate
if they be not present they be not
eligible
there will be no
consensus without they wid be we to
vote for

it be as much a sin to offer flattery
to accept it


chasten but not

the Camerlengo ask how long you can
postpone the open prayer without
making another announcement to the
public

two year and three month
the conclave of


tell the Camerlengo the cardinal
elector will take every minute
required to perform they sacred
trust
no far announcement be
necessary


he be be concern about the public
dimension
people will think

what we tell they to think


professor langdon welcome to vatican
city
ernesto olivetti inspector
generale of the vatican police force

this way please we will meet in the
headquarters of the swiss guard

i assumed you be swiss guard

no
the gendarmerie be responsible
for everything inside the vatican
wall with the exception of the
security of he holiness and the
apostolic palace
that be swiss
guard
the Commandante generale of
the roman Carbinieri have joined we as
well in an advisory capacity and
the Guarda Nacionale have send a
representative

so jurisdictionally this be

god damn nightmare


the great castration

i beg you pardon


pius feel the male form might
inspire lust so he get a hammer and
chisel and unmanned two hundred
statue
these plaster fig leave
be added later

be you antiCatholic professor
langdon

i
no i be antivandalism

i urge you to guard you tone in there
the swiss guard be a call not a
profession and it encourage a certain
zealotry
commander rocher the
head of the guard be a deeply
spiritual man and he be close to the
late pope
understand

i just hope i can help


so do i
you be i idea

wait here

ms
Vetra
i be commander rocher
Commandante Principale of the swiss
guard
thank you for coming
and
professor langdon

that be right
rocher look he up and
down so you be langdon

thank god the symbologist be here
ms
Vetra this way please

there be be a development
we
received another threat from the
kidnapper


canister be stolen from we lab
around midnight last night
the
intruder killed i research partner
leonardo Bentivoglio and mutilate
he in order to bypass security

we use retinal scanner
they cut out he eye

that canister contain an extremely
combustible substance called
antimatter
we need to locate it
immediately or evacuate vatican city

i be quite familiar with incendiary
ms
Vetra
i have not hear of
antimatter

it be new energy research technology
it use a reverse polarity vacuum to
filter out antimatter positron
generated in particle acceleration in
the large hadron collider at


the antimatter be suspended there
in an airtight nanocomposite she will
with electromagnet at each end
but
if it be to fall out of suspension
and come into contact with matter
say the bottom of the canister the
two oppose force will annihilate
one another
violently

and what might because it to fall out of
suspension

the battery going dead
which it
will
in six hour and eleven minute

where be that camera
number eighty
six

it be wireless
it too be stolen
that could be anywhere inside the
vatican wall

you have get to find it

we be a bit preoccupied with four
miss cardinal at the moment

you do not understand
an
annihilation be a cataclysmic event
it would be a blind explosion
equivalent to about five megaton
the blast radius alone would be

vatican city will be consume by
light



those be the exact word the
kidnapper used



we will destroy you four pillar
brand you preferiti and sacrifice
they on the altar of science
and
then bring you church down upon you
vatican city will be consume by
light

it be an ancient llluminati threat
the destruction of vatican city
through light
the four pillar
he probably mean the kidnapped
cardinal
you do not mention they
be the preferiti
the favorite to be chosen as the new
pope
play it again



we will destroy you four pillar
brand you preferiti and sacrifice
they on the altar of science

stop it there

brand they another llluminati
legend this one say there be a set
of five brand each one an ambigram


the first four be the fundamental
element of science earth air
fire water
the fifth be a
mystery
maybe it be this

he said they would be killed publicly
in
church

revenge for la Purga

la Purga

do not you guy read you own history

the church kidnap four
llluminati scientist and brand
they chest with the symbol of the
cross
to purge they sin

murder they and left they body in
the street as a warn to other to
stop questioning church ruling on
scientific matter
it be after la
Purga that a dark more violent
llluminati emerge
this sound
like retribution
be there any more



and then bring you church down
upon you
vatican city will be
consume by light



shine star at the end of the path
of illumination


the path of illumination

i need to get into the vatican
archive

professor this be not the appropriate
moment to

you petition have be denied seven
time mr
langdon

this have nothing to do with that
the path of illumination be an ancient
trail through rome that lead to the
church of the illumination a secret
place where llluminati member could
meet in safety
if i can find the
Segno the sign that mark the start
of the path i be will to bet the
four church along it be where he
intend to murder you cardinal
if
we can get to one of they before he
do we can stop it
but to find
the start of the path i need to get
into the archive

even if i wanted to help you access
be only by written decree of the
curator and the board of vatican
librarian

or by papal mandate

yes
but as you have no doubt hear
the holy father be

what about il Camerlengo
let i
talk to he


the Camerlengo
he be just a priest
here the former popes chamberlain

do not the power of the holy see rest
with he during tempe sede vacante

hey fella you called i


he holiness once told i that a pope
be a man torn between two world
the real world and the divine

he warn that any church that ignore
reality would not survive to enjoy the
divine

it seem the real world be upon we
tonight
i be familiar with llluminati lore and
the legend of the brandings
la
Purga be a dark stain on the church
history
i be not surprise this ghost
have come back to haunt we


Commandante have you begin a search
for this explosive device

of course but it could be anywhere
and the safety of the cardinal be i
primary concern at the moment

the sistine chapel be a fortress as
long as the cardinal be in conclave
you security concern be at a
minimum
devote as much of you
resource as possible to a search for

signore if you be about to suggest
we make a nakedeye search of all of
vatican city i must

commander
though i be not his
holiness when you address i you be
address this office
do you
understand

yes padre

good
now you said the image on
screen be illuminated by artificial
light
may i suggest methodically
cutting the power to various section
of the city
when the image on you
screen go dark you will have a more
specific idea of the device
location

ms
Vetra
besides yourself and
you research partner who know about
you antimatter project


only the director of
but
leonardo keep detail journal
if he
told anyone else about what we be
do he would have make a note of
it

do you have these journal

i can have they fly here from geneva
in an hour

mr
langdon
you be correct that i
may grant you access to the archive

thank you padre

i said you be correct that i may not
that i will
Christianitys most
sacred codex be in that archive
given you recent entanglement with
the church i need to ask you a
question first

do you believe in god sir

father i simply believe that
religion can often

i do not ask if you believe what man
say about god i ask if you believe
in god

i be an academic
i mind tell i i
will never understand god


and you heart

tell i i be not mean to

i believe that faith be a gift which
i have not be fortunate enough to
receive

be delicate with we treasure


the archive be this way



professor langdon

if this path really lead to the
church of illumination that may be
where they have hidden the antimatter

shine star at the end of the
path
i thought exactly

if we find this bomb can you
deactivate it


no but i can change it battery as
long as it have more than five minute
of life
that would give we another
twentyfour hour to get it back to


vittoria Vetra
be you really a
symbologist or be he mocking you

both
you be a physicist

Bioentanglement physics
interconnectivity of life system

okay

what be we looking for in the
archive

little book written by galileo

galileo be llluminati

and a devout catholic
he think
science and religion be not enemy
but two different language telling
the same story
he wanted like
mind to be able to find the church of
illumination but he could not exactly
advertise it location so he created
a coded path
an unknown llluminati
master sculpt four statue each a
tribute to one of the four fundamental
element earth air fire water
and put they out in public in
church throughout rome
each
statue held a clue pointing to the
next
and at the end of the trail be
the church of illumination


what make you think he be going to
murder the cardinal in the church

the llluminati called those four
church by a special name LAltare
di scienza
the altar of science

making the

sacrifice they on the altar of
science he said

oh
oh wow

we go in alone

vatican police be not allow access
to the archive only swiss guard
lt
Chartrand will meet you inside
i will
be here when you be do



you have be informed of the new
situation

may god mercy be upon we

and the other cardinal

await you word

may i ask you guidance padre

i belief be we should proceed with
the seal of conclave

at this hour
that would be highly
unorthodox

and yet within church law
it be in
i power i have be chosen great
elector

the cruel honor in christendom

the only ambition i have be for i
church
st
peters church which
be under attack at it most vulnerable
moment
this be not a coincidence
be it possible we enemy hope to
distract we from we sacred task

the church will not fall in a day
we
may be wise to consider evacuation


that be exactly what they want
publicity and panic
we must not
give they oxygen for the media fire

what of the safety of the cardinal

surely there be not an elector present
who value he physical being more
than the unbroken leadership of the
holy see

and the people in st
peters square

they care as deeply about they church
as we do
they faith will sustain
they

but if they faith do not protect
they from an explosion

we be all bound for heaven eventually
be we not

spoken like one who have enjoy the
blessing of a long and full life

signore do not confuse the power of
the office you temporarily hold with
you true place here in the vatican
you be a favorite of he holiness
but he holiness be with he father
now

mea culpa

seal the door


the chamber be hermetic vault
oxygen be keep at lowest possible
level
it be a partial vacuum
inside
more than ten minute in the
vault be not recommended without
breathe apparatus

i will be just outside the door

watch you mr
langdon


take a moment
if you feel double
vision double over

feel like i be
scuba dive
with
the wrong mixture

plenty of time

uh
actually i take that back



you have no idea what you be missing

conclave will go on without we
the
voice of god will not be silence



i be refer to i tea
last
chance i would be happy to make you a
cup

may god forgive you for what you have
do


father if god have issue they will not
be with what i have do
but with what i be about to do


confiscate from the netherlands by
the vatican shortly after Galileos
death
i have be petition to see
it for almost ten year
ever since
i realized what be in it

what make you so sure the Segno be
there

the number
i keep seeing it over
and over in llluminati letter scribble
in the margin or sometimes just signed
that way
it be a numerical
clue but to what
five of course be
the sacred llluminati number the
pentagram pythagora a dozen other
example in science but why three


it make no sense
and then i think
what if it be a roman numeral




Galileos third text
Dialogo
Discorsi

Diagramma

Diagramma della Verita
the diagram
of truth

i know about Dialogo and Discorsi
galileo laid out he theory about
the earth revolve around the sun
and the church forced he to recant
but what be this

this be where he get the word out
the
truth not what the vatican forced he
to write
smuggle out of rome and
printed in holland on sedge papyrus
that way any scientist catch with a
copy could simply drop it in water and
the booklet would dissolve

between it delicate nature and the
vatican burning it be say this be
the only copy that remains


and if i be right the Segno should be
hide
on page number
five

latin
can you

bit

finger acid

movement of the planet
elliptical
orbit
heliocentricity

i be sorry i do not think there be
anything that could be interpret
as a

do that again

line of text
in english


english
why english

no one speak it at the vatican
it
be considered pollute
too free
think the language of radical
like shakespeare and chaucer

another line

the path of light be laid the sacred
test
i need a pen we have to
transcribe this

sorry professor
no time

ah what the hell


twenty minute till eight where be
we headed


i will know in a minute give i the
paper

from santis earthly tomb with demon
hole

where do you get that paper

cross rome the mystic element
unfold

we borrowed it

the path of light be laid the sacred
test

be you insane

let angel guide you on you earthly
quest

you remove a document from the
vatican archive

huh
oh um well she moved so
fast

the first marker sound like it be at
santis tomb

sound like

but who be santi


raphael

raphael
the sculptor

santi be he last name

raphael be buried at the pantheon

be the pantheon even a church

snatching up the

old catholic church in rome


i have just pull a dozen of i good
man from vatican city during conclave
and left the search for the antimatter
device in the hand of secondary
officer
you would well be right


i believe i be

the pantheon be one of the busy
tourist spot in rome how could he
hope to get away with it
it be
impossible

as impossible as kidnap four
cardinal from vatican city
the
poem be precise

the poem
unbelievable
i be
base this operation on an american
interpretation of a four hundred year
old poem

the information we have clearly refer
to raphaels tomb and raphaels tomb
be inside that build

the pantheon be you one chance to
catch this guy

one
i think you said four

pathway four marker
we will have
four chance to catch he

you would have a hundred year ago
the vatican have all the pagan statue
in the pantheon remove and destroyed
in the late s
whatever marker
be there to lead we to the next
church be go now
the path be
dead
this be you chance


separate approach

i be
long story

make it short


can not be do
what time be it

seven minute to eight

be that mickey mouse

long story

make it short

can not be do

the oculus
that could be the
demon hole in the poem

why be the tomb at an angle

to face east
sun worship

but this be a christian church


new religion often adopt exist
holiday to make conversion less
shock
december th be the pagan
holiday of the unconquered sun
make
it a handy choice for christs
birthday

you be saying christianity be
repackage sun worship

where do you think halo come from
not just sun worship though the
catholic borrowed communion from the
aztec canonization from Euphemerus
the cruciform from the egyptian

no wonder they do not like you around
here

just trying to keep the conversation
lively
check the recess
i will go left
see you in a hundred eighty degree

vittoria


raphaels tomb
but

it be the wrong one

what be you talking about

he be moved here in
century
after Diagramma be published

that be not possible the poem said

where be he originally buried

i do not know
urbino i think
santis earthly tomb
what else
could it possibly
santi s tomb

damn it
santis tomb must mean
one of the chapel he build
he be
not buried in it he design it
rich
people commission burial chapel in
church all over rome in he day
and the demon hole it be not the
oculus it be an undercroft a crypt
common sixteenth century term

do anyone have any question


yes
do raphael santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex and
angel figure commission by the
catholic church

well

i be sorry i
i can only think of
one

Onell do


wrong
what do you mean wrong

the first altar of science be the
chigi chapel in the church of santa
maria del popolo about a mile from
here
it used to be called capella
della terra chapel of the earth
earth the first element
this be
it i be certain

you be certain of the pantheon

outside a perimeter
secure but
invisible
no light no gun no

why the hell do not you figure this
out in the first place


i make a mistake

be it raphael

the chapel be
but the sculpture
be bernini
the unknown illuminati master be
bernini

do not he work for the church

almost exclusively

illuminati even infiltrate the
vatican
they hide in plain sight

habakkuk and the angel

habakkuk

the prophet who predict the
annihilation of the earth
this be
the first marker

let angel guide you on you lofty
quest



the path be alive


southwest
it point southwest

Earthairfirewater we be looking
for a bernini sculpture have
something to do with air
and the next church be southwest of
here

you be sure this time

i need a map
one that show all
the church in rome

i could use it now

and a compass




robert


the black rectangle with cross be
church and none of they intersect
the line until it come to an end
right in the middle of st
peters
square


you theory do not hold up
professor
michelangelo design
st
peters not bernini

the basilica be michelangelo but the
square be bernini
the second
marker must be a statue in the square

it be ten minute till nine
can we
go any fast

not unless we want the full attention
of the world press


another obelisk
we be close


there must be a hundred statue up
there which one be it

how in god name would anyone make a
sculpture about air

bas relief

the other half of sculpture be ba
relief
look for more
something have to
do with air


west Ponente
the west wind
an
angeles face and five streak
air



he be still alive

he chest
they puncture he lung

clear the square



when do this call come in

three four minute ago
the same
voice as on the tape
we be
analyze the accent now alsatian be
we good guess at the moment

and he actually claimed responsibility
for the death of he holiness

not personally but he said it be the
illuminati
he said they murder
he

that be ridiculous the holy father
die of a stroke
do he say how
they claim to have do it

the pope own medication
drug
known as heparin

the pope take heparin

he have thrombophlebitis
he take an
injection once a day
but no one
know that

someone know


he holiness have health concern
he
be subject to seizure as well
but
he take step to make sure he be
watch
for safety
that be all
he wished to be make public and
that be all we should discuss

heparin be lethal in the wrong dosage
an overdose would because massive
internal bleed and brain
hemorrhages
at first it might look
like a stroke but in a few day he
body would show sign we could easily

ms
Vetra in case you be unaware
papal autopsy be prohibited by
vatican law
we be not about to
defile he Holinesss body just
because he enemy claim to

of course we be not
we will make a
public announcement refute this
absurd claim


i be afraid that be out of the question
cardinal Mortati have insist this
entire matter be keep internal

cardinal Mortati should not even be
aware of this he be locked in
conclave


he final instruction before seal
the door be very clear no outside
communication unless absolutely
necessary

cardinal Mortati will remember that he
be dean of the college of cardinal
not he holiness himself



as you say
yet technically now that
conclave have begin it be his
privilege and duty to control public
announcement
i have drafted a short
release about the incident in the
square but any other statement be
specifically prohibited
for that the
cardinal have ask i to remind you
we have a chimney

as you say
commander rocher the search for the
device

we have turn the power off and on to
about twenty percent of vatican city
nothing on the video yet

mr
langdon you have be right so far
if belatedly about the path
it be now
nine fifteen how quickly can you find
the next church

the line of the breath in the carve
point due east directly away from
vatican city but there be five
line so there be room for error

there be about twenty church that
intersect it
none of they name
invoke fire but there must be a
bernini sculpture inside one of they
that do
i be going to need to get
back into the archive to find it


escort he

the journal i ask for
i would like
to stay here and study they
if
leonardo told anyone else about we
project that could be the killer

fine

professor would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you

it would surprise the hell out of i


a statement just released by the
vatican express sympathy for the
family of the mugging victim a
tourist from dusseldorf


who be now confirmed dead
vatican police have a suspect in
custody and after photograph the
crime scene

will allow the crowd of faithful
back into st
peters square where
security will be double

sadly the vatican spokesman point
out where crowd go

so often follow crime
we be
trying now to get the name of the
tourist who be wait a

we be get word now of smoke
smoke from the sistine chapel chimney

tend to keep track of they holding

the catholic church be not a
corporation signore it be a beacon
a source of inspiration for one
billion lose and frighten soul

sure sure i get that

but it be also a bank

Cfmmander olivetti said i be not to
leave you side this time

be not i it be she

overdose of heparin

he gum
postmortem the blood
congeal and turn the inside of the
mouth black

even though he die fourteen day ago

that portion of we white zone be


crosswired with that build
commander rocher be extend the
search if he would known the archive
be on that grid he never would have
killed the power

or there be the other possibility

infiltration be the illuminati
specialty why not the head of the
swiss guard

perhaps

i want to speak to the Camerlengo

il Camerlengo be unavailable

unavailable
why

he be find evidence that the holy
father be indeed murdered
he be
seeking guidance

from whom

from god

oh right

please
make an effort



the journal
where be they

who take the journal from this desk

unseal the door

signore do you realize that for the
first time in vatican history a
Camerlengo have just cross the sacred
threshold of conclave after seal
the door


there have be a development


please
a moment
if i

it be true we be under attack from an
old enemy
and this time they have
strike from within murdering we holy
father and threatening we all with
destruction at the hand of they new
god science
so what be we to do

oh no

since the day of galileo the church
have tried to slow the relentless march
of science sometimes with misguided
means but always with benevolent
intention
still they call we
backward ignorant


but who be more ignorant
the man
who cannot define lightning or the
man who do not respect it awesome
power

the promise of science have not be
keep
we be a fracture and frantic
species moving down of destruction in
the name of progress

science and religion be not enemy
but there be thing that science be
simply too young to understand
we
be here to lead but how


shall we cloak ourselves in silence
and secrecy as in the past
or do
we open the door take down the
blacken curtain and speak to we
flock

Signores i ask no i pray that you
break this conclave
open the
door

evacuate st
peters square
the wire meet at a center point just above the roar

tell the world the truth
the third cardinal still alive be suspended over the searing



the cleat on the wall
get
something to stand on

who stretched as far as he possibly can just manage to
see the bleed figure of olivetti staggering toward he

until he be in the back

Polizia
and turn
roman Carbinieri have run into

but sometimes the answer be no


the college will not break conclave

we can not hide this anymore
the
burn church

despicable act of terrorism
father simeon will make a suitable
announcement lament the loss of
life
may i suggest you direct
you energy to helping the swiss
guard confront the possibility of this
explosive device and leave church
leadership

to it leader


eminence
there be a grow fear
that without the four prefiriti a two
thirds majority for any candidate may
be impossible
unless

speak plainly


it be the recommendation of many that
you ask to be remove from you post
as great elector


thereby making yourself eligible
to wear the ring of the fisherman


if it be god will may his will be





those journal be private property

i demand that you return they to i

no attempt at a

they be material evidence in a
vatican investigation

i be an italian citizen and i have a
right to


this be not italy
it be not even
rome
the vatican be it own
country with it own law and when
those journal crossed we border they
become we property
you will get
they back when i have decided they
contain nothing of value to this
investigation

do you have something to hide
Commandante rocher

robert langdon wedge into the top of the open holding a
and those same foot hurry to the front of the smoldering

what direction be that

direction
west i think
mr
langdon we have confirmed with the
vatican that they invited you into
this investigation but what i

maria del popolo be
the cop do not

the church it be the first altar of
science

and st
peters be


and we be over here

and west be

cross rome

it be a cross
the poem mean it
literally
the four altar of
science form a perfect cross

which mean the fourth element water
should be right about

here

professor i be ask to escort you to
the vatican immediately
commander
rocher have ask to see you

but i be a sinner


professor
the vatican insist that


the vatican be about to see it fourth
cardinal murdered tonight

now you can either do what they tell
you and force i to go to the vatican
where we can all mourn he death
together or you can show they how
real cop act and take i to the
piazza navona where we might be able
to stop it

by all means talk it over
but in
fourteen minute he will be dead


possibility of terrorism as the
church have now confirmed arson at one
of it old and holy church

resulting in at least six confirmed
death

initial rumor that one of the
dead be cardinal ebner of frankfurt


be refute by the vatican which
have ask international media not to
engage in quote wild speculation

as conclave go on with no sign
of agreement on a new pope yet


at
if the church be still in
peril give the order to evacuate the
cardinal
but with dignity let
they exit into st
peters square
with they head held high
i do not
want the last image of this church to
be frighten old man sneak out a
back door
if cardinal Mortati
protest escort he bodily
do you
understand

if you think it be the right thing
signore

i be certain it be the wrong thing
and i will be remove from i post
for it
but i also know we have
no choice

please clear the room so that i may
pray on the matter

the first pope he be crucified
upsidedown on vatican hill
right
beneath where we be standing

upon this rock i will build i

what be wrong

heat decrease battery life
we may

so

if i pull the power with less than

at least
if it go off down here the damage
will be



wait

father please

in st
peters square where

evacuation the crowd be actually
growing in size as we await

and the helicopter explode in a blind pinpoint of white

that disappear into the night



signore Mortati he be alive

be you okay

thank god

do we have time for that story now

do i have someone to tell it to
the crowd in st
peters square in rapture
there be


Signores
you be no doubt aware
that by holy law the man be ineligible
for election to the papacy
he be
not a cardinal he be a priest a
chamberlain
and there be the
matter of he inadequate age
i be
sorry the protocol of conclave be
not subject to modification
i will
not call a ballot on this matter

but signore you would not call the
ballot
surely you remember you
give up you post as great elector

they be singing in st
peters
square
what happen here tonight
transcend we law

do it
be it god will that we
abandon reason and give ourselves over
to frenzy
discard the rule of the
church

perhaps they need not be discarded

i be think now of romano Pontifici
Eligendo numero


ballote be not the only method by
which a pope can be elected
there
be another more divine method

acclimation by adoration


si signore

of course
answering those around
he who look confuse
election by adoration occur when
all the cardinal as if by
inspiration of the holy spirit
freely and spontaneously
unanimously and aloud proclaim one
individual name

and the law state that adoration
supersede all other eligibility
