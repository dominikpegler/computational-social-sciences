police be revealing no detail in

richard

we can not find this guy

i know what i see walter

lot of money to defend you
plea
to second degree

i do not kill i wife

class white man charged in a
violent crime



it be a circumstantial case but it be
also a jury trial
we play they they

but if we lose we lose big
just remember they be lined up a
block long to have you hide

no forcible entry be find

nothing be missing

the defendant print be find on

officer come in

how tall be this man dr
kimble

i can not be sure
we be mostly on
the floor fight

company
i handle security for it
top executive

by all means

he be pulling we chain sam
if this
be the guy kimble be looking for

piece

keep somebody on he
if he move
i want to know

i be sorry sir dr
nichols be at a
medical conference at the hilton

it be very important i reach he

i be sorry sir they said it be an
emergency

can you talk

richard
yes
i be on a hotel
phone
what be going on

i find he charlie
i find the
guy that killed helen

what

it be all about a drug charlie
they
tried to kill i because of a drug

who

DevlinMacGregor and Lentz
Lentz
be supervising the

you

protocol
he know i would find out the
drug have problem
it be Lentz

richard Lentz be dead
he die in
an auto accident last summer

can you prove this about the drug

i need you help
call mr
roosevelt
and tell he i be coming in

if you be richard kimble
why
would you hunt for a onearmed man
you think killed you wife
find
hint then leave he and call we

to throw we off he trail

unless
what if you be a well
respected surgeon and wanted to kill
you wife
how would you do it

i would hire a pro
sight unseen

set it up to look like a robbery
go bad

how would you find he
look in the
phone book

through a connection

maybe through a company you do some
business with

like a pharmaceutical company
someone in security

on the night of he wife murder
kimble attend a hospital benefit
sponsored by DevlinMacgregor
pharmaceutical sykes company

but sykes claim he be out of town

and company record support that he
be on a business trip

that be an easy fix
so let we say he
be in town
do the job
everything
go as planned with one problem

instead of looking like a robbery
go bad kimble end up be the
one accused

tried convict

and the hit man get away clean

so kimble return to hunt for and
find the hit man

why
to share the blame
he would still
go to prison

you be underestimate the power of
the good doctor
it would be he
word against
sykes
who would
you believe

so what do kimble do next

get help

stevens check phone record for
sykes and kimble

find out who this guy be

why do i get all the great job

it sure be good to see you again
dr
kimble

you too roosevelt
be a long
time

this be the

you
file and
sample
dr
nichols said you
needed

thanks roosevelt



emergency operator

i want to report a fire
no it be
not i place it be a couple door
down

oh i god
richard

i loan you something once kath
and i need they back

mr
gerard

doctor
could i have a minute

he be a security specialist at
DevlinMacgregor pharmaceutical

i do not know he
you be get
pretty desperate be not you mr
gerard
i told you you would not
find richard

dr
kimble have not come back to you
for help have he

no
and it seem like we have be
over this ground before
now if
you will excuse i

dr
nichols
do you know the other
man in the photograph

i never see he before

advance in nuclear tissue and
pathology research by dr
charles
nichols
i bet they line up to hear that one

half the people in the study be
indigents
no followup no baseline
on they
who could say they do not
come into the study with bad liver

the one on the right be one of the
sample you send i
it show a lot
of perriportal inflammation loaded
with eosinophil
when you see that
with the accumulation of bile it be
a classic for

drug induce hepatitis

i be impress
now look at this

accord to the study this be a
slice from the same liver

cold normal

clearly not from the same tissue
in fact

see this small area of bile duct
proliferation
von Meyenbergs
complex
occur in only of the
population
but it be in every one
of you five sample

that be statistically impossible

that be because they be all from the
same liver

he name Lentz
pathologist
i
only remember he because he die
last summer

anybody down in pathology who might
know something about the guy

it be kinda late to catch anyone
but you might go by the morgue
there be an old guy down there
who be be around forever

just what i want to do before
dinner

be you mr
roosevelt

yes

we be united states marshal
we be
trying to find out some information
about a pathologist named Lentz
he
used to be on staff here

he be dead

yeah we hear
we wanted to know if
he know or have any contact with dr
richard kimble

i
i have not see dr
kimble

that be not what i ask sir
i just
wanted to know if dr
kimble and dr
Lentz know each other

i
i do not know
excuse i i get to go

i think you be lying to we

they would be home free if i have not be
leaning on they to account for the
liver i be seeing
and i would not
have see the liver if i have not
tell the guy on i service to call
i when they have case that be
bleeding excessively in surgery

big buck
one schmuck standing in
the way
easy get rid of he and
he wife
but why Lentz

why not
he be one of the original
patent holder
toss the sample i
send replace they with healthy
sample issue the path report on
the healthy stuffpiece of cake

when do Lentz die

oh last summer sometime
august
why

because a good third of the sample
Lentz approved be signed after he
die

someone else used Lentzs name

pathologist at DevlinMacgregor

they would not have have the access
they would have needed someone at
the hospital

where be you going

to see an old friend

it be newman
line two

the old guy do not know where he be
going
but he picked up some tissue
sample
