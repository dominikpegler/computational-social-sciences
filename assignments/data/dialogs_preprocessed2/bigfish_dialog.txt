john august
base on the novel by
daniel wallace
final production draft



there be some fish that cannot be
catch
it be not that they be fast
or strong than other fish
they be
just touched by something extra
call it luck
call it grace
one
such fish be the beast



by the time i be born he be already
a legend
he would taken more hundred
dollar lure than any fish in alabama
some said that fish be the ghost of
henry walls a thief who drown
in that river year before
other
claimed he be a lesser dinosaur
left over from the cretaceous period

i do not put any stock into such
speculation or superstition
all i
know be i would be trying to catch
that fish since i be a boy no big
than you
and on the day you be born that
be the day i finally caught he

now i would tried everything on it
worm lure peanut butter peanut
butterandcheese
but on that day i
have a revelation
if that fish be
the ghost of a thief the usual bait
be not going to work
i would have
to use something he truly desire

you finger

gold

i tied i ring to the strong line
they make strong enough to hold
up a bridge they said if just for
a few minute and i cast upriver

the beast jump up and grab it
before the ring even hit the water
and just as fast he snap clean
through that line

you can see i predicament
i wedding
ring the symbol of fidelity to i
wife soon to be the mother of i
child be now lost in the gut of an
uncatchable fish

make he stop

what do you do

i follow that fish upriver and
downriver for three day and three
night until i finally have he box
in

with these two hand i reach in
and snatched that fish out of the
river
i look he straight in the
eye
and i make a remarkable
discovery

this fish the beast
the whole time
we be calling it a he when in
fact it be a she
it be fat with
egg and be going to lay they any
day

now i be in a situation
i could
gut that fish and get i ring back
but do so i would be killing the
smart catfish in the ashton river
soon to be mother of a hundred other

do i want to deprive i soontobe
bear son the chance to catch a fish
like this of he own
this lady fish
and i well we have the same destiny

we be part of the same equation

honey it be still you night

now you may well ask since this
lady fish be not the ghost of a thief
why do it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it
closer
he hold up
he ring
that be the lesson i learned that
day the day i son be born

sometimes the only way to catch an
uncatchable woman be to offer she a
wedding ring

what a father not allow to talk
about he son

i be a footnote in that story
i be
the context for you great adventure
which never happen
incidentally
you be selling novelty product in
wichita the day i be born

jesus christ

friend of yours
do you help he
out of a bind

come on will
everyone like that
story

no dad they do not
i do not like
the story
not anymore not after a
thousand time
i know all the
punchline dad
i can tell they as
well as you can
for one night one night in you
entire life the universe do not
revolve around edward bloom
it
revolve around i and i wife
how
can you not understand that

sorry to embarrass you

you be embarrassing yourself dad

after that night i do not speak to
i father again for three year

william bloom with the associate
press if i could just



we communicate indirectly i guess
in she letter and christmas card
i mother would write for both of
they



when i would call mom would say that
dad be out driving
or swimming in
the pool

true to form we never talk about
we not talking



the truth be i do not see anything
of myself in i father and i do not
think he see anything of himself in
i
we be like stranger who know
each other very well



in telling the story of i father
life it be impossible to separate
the fact from the fiction the man
from the myth
the good i can do be
to tell it the way he told i



it do not always make sense and
most of it never happen



but that be what kind of story this
be



now mrs
bloom i will need you to
give i one good push

the bad thing that ever happen
to i

i think you be not die

i said this be not how i go
the last
part be much more unusual
trust i
on that

dr
bennett say i be going to have
to be home for a week

that be nothing
i once have to stay
in bed for three year

do you have chicken pox

i wish




truth be no one quite know what be
wrong
most time a person grow up
gradually
i find myself in a hurry



i muscle could not keep up with i
bone and i bone could not keep up
with i body ambition
so i spent
the good part of three year
confined to i bed with the world
book encyclopedia be i only means
of exploration
i have make it all
the way to the gs hope to find
an answer to i gigantificationism
when i uncovered an article about
the common goldfish

keep in a small bowl the goldfish
will remain small
with more space
the fish can grow double triple or
quadruple it size




it occur to i then that perhaps
the reason for i growth be that i
be intended for large thing
after
all a giant man can not have an
ordinarysized life



as soon as i bone have settled in
they adult configuration i set
upon i plan to make a big place
for myself in ashton

edward bloom



i be the big thing ashton have
ever see
until one day a stranger
arrive

he eat an entire cornfield

he eat i dog

if you be not going to stop he mayor
we will

i will not have mob violence in this
town
now have someone tried talking
to he

you can not reason with i be

he be a monster



i will do it

i will talk to he
see if i can get
he to move on

son that creature could crush you
without trying

trust i he will have to try

hello

i name be edward bloom
i want to
talk to you





i be not going anywhere until you
show yourself



armed with the foreknowledge of i
own death i know the giant could not
kill i
all the same i preferred
to keep i bone unbroken

why be you here

so you can eat i
the town decided
to send a human sacrifice and i
volunteer

i arm be a little stringy but
there be some good eat on i leg
i mean i would be tempt to eat they
myself
so i guess just if you could get
it over with quick
because i be not
much for pain really

look i can not go back
i be a human
sacrifice
if i go back everyone
will think i be a coward
and i would
rather be dinner than a coward

here start with i hand
it will be
an appetizer

i do not want to eat you
i do not
want to eat anybody
it be just i get
so hungry
i be too big

do you ever think maybe you be not
too big
maybe this town just too
small
i mean look at it

hardly two story in the whole place
now i have hear in real city they have
get building so tall you can not even
see the top of they

really

would not lie to you
and they have get
allyoucaneat buffet

and truthfully i do
want you to leave karl
but i want
to leave with you

you well it be too small for a man
of i ambition
i can not see staying
here a day longer

you do not like it

i love every square inch of it
but
i can feel the edge closing in on
i
mane life can only grow to a
certain size in a place like this
so what do you say

but take with you this key to
the city and know that any time you

that afternoon as i left ashton
everyone seem to have advice

find yourself a nice girl
do not
trust anyone in kentucky
watch you
pride edward bloom



but there be one person whose counsel
i held above all other



she said that the big fish in
the river get that way by never
be catch

okay
thanks

what do she say

beat i



there be two road out of ashton
a new one which be pave and an
old one that be not
people do not
use the old road anymore and it have
developed the reputation of be
haunted



since i have no intention of ever
returning to ashton this seem as
good a time as any to find out what
lay down that old road

you know anyone who be taken it

that poet norther winslow do
he
be going to paris france

have like it because no one ever
hear from he again

way and i will cut through here
meet
you on the far side

you be not trying to run away

just to be sure you can take i
pack

you stupid sonofa





there come a point where a reasonable
man will swallow he pride and admit
he be make a terrible mistake
the
truth be i be never a reasonable
man

and what i recalled of sunday school
be that the more difficult something
become the more reward it be in
the end

and then i realized this be not the
end of i life

this be not how i die

i do not know if you have see it but
josephine have some photo in the
most recent newsweek

really
that be wonderful

i spent a week in morocco for the
story
it be incredible

we will have to pick up a copy

i do not know if you be aware of this
josephine but african parrot in
they native home of the congo
they speak only french

really

you be lucky to get four word out
of they in english
but if you be
to walk through the jungle you would
hear they speaking the most elaborate
french
those parrot talk about
everything
politics movie fashion
everything but religion

why not religion dad

it be rude to talk about religion
you never know who you be going to
offend

josephine actually go to the congo
last year

oh so you know

mom would you say you understand
dad

of course

what i mean be do you really know
what be going on in he head

yes

how be that possible
i mean you
try to ask he a question and suddenly
it be another one of he story
you can not honestly say you know he

yes will i do
and do not presume
thing you do not know

would you say you understand
josephine

yes
but that be a different

no it be not
it be exactly the same
you father and i meet we dated and
we married we choose each other
because we understood each other on
some fundamental level
just the
same as you two

josephine and i have a lot in common

yes you both think william bloom be
a very smart man
the problem be you only see i as
you mother and not as someone
wife
and i have be he wife longer
than i have be you mother
you can not
discount that

true
but i have known he i whole
life and i do not feel like i know
he at all
or ever will

i know it be not easy
just remember
he do not choose to be you father
and you do not choose to be he son
you just end up together
you could
pick number out of a dark bag and
it would be just the same
if you ask
i it be a wonder parent and child
can stand each other at all

but i understand you mom
i always
have

well clearly you do not
but i be not
the mystery you be trying to solve

there be a time when a man need to
fight and a time when he need to
accept that he destiny be lost
that the ship have sail and that
only a fool would continue



the truth be i have always be a
fool

sandra templeton

keep she same date at the chapel
only the groom have changed


i think you said you do not have a
church wedding

well we be all set to but there
be a complication




be it the medicine that be making you
thirsty

life
never really known why

there be one time when i be
eleven

you be talking about you wedding

i do not forget
i be just work
on a tangent
see most man they will
tell a story straight through and
it will not be complicate but it will not
be interesting either

i like you story

and i like you

now
the thing about working for a
circus be you do not have a regular
address and after three year i have
a lot of undelivered mail

during the four week i be in the
hospital the postmaster finally
catch up with i



it turned out that while i heart
belong to sandra the rest of i
body belong to the you

government



hitch in the army be up to three
year at that point and have wait
three year just to meet sandra i
know i could not survive be away
from she that long
so i take every
hazardous assignment i could find
with the hope of get i time
down to less than a year





sometimes a girl can feel so alone
without a lover to call she own
sometimes it be so bad she want to
explode
want to grab the first man she see
and tear off he clothes

but she will not
no she can not
she need a special special different
unusual man
because that girl
who look like i
she have want but she have need

any of you get need

i have have twice the adventure
cry double the tear
two time the bad time in half the
year
i need a strong man because i have
get
twice the love to give

say hello jing

hello jing

i be ping
she be jing
she be the good
one
i be the bad one

how could you miss you cue
you
make i look like a fool out there
alone

you be not alone

who the hell be you

i be not going to hurt you

damn right you be not


tell you man not to bother we
and
lock that door

please i need you help

what make you think we will help you




over the next hour i described i
love for sandra kay templeton and
the ordeal that bring i before
they
as it have always be this
love be i salvation
it be destine
to be



we put together an elaborate plan
for escape involve a whale ship
to russia a barge to cuba and a
small dirty canoe to miami
we all
know it would be dangerous

and what be we suppose to do when
we get to america

i can get you booking
i know the
big man in show business

bob hope

big




and so the twin and i begin we
arduous journey halfway around the
world
unfortunately there be no
way to send a message back to america



and so it be no surprise that the
army believe i be dead



after four month sandra have get
over the bad of the nightmare
when the phone ring she do not think
it be somehow i calling she
when
a car drive past she do not get up
to check out the window


i talk with you father last night

do you

you never told i how you parent
meet

they meet at auburn

what about the detail
how they
fell in love
the circus
the war
you never told i any of that

that be because most of it never
happen

but it be romantic

mmm

mmm what

mmm what
i know well than to
argue romance with a french woman

do you love you father

everyone love i father
he be a
very likeable guy

do you love he

you have to understand
when i be
growing up he be go more than he
be here
and i start think
maybe he have a second life somewhere
else
with another house another
family
he leaf we he go to
they
or maybe there be no family
maybe he never wanted a family
but
whatever it be maybe he like that
second life well
and the reason
he tell all those story be because
he can not stand this bore place

but it be not true

what be true
i have never hear i
father say a single true thing

look i know why you like he
i
know why everyone like he
but i
need you to tell i i be not crazy

be haul it down to texas for
drink water only they do not
count on an elephant be frozen
inside
the woolly kind
mammoth

dad

what

i be trying to make a metaphor here

then you should not have start with
a question
because people want to
answer question
you should have
start with the thing about
iceberg be


the thing about iceberg be you only
see percent of they
the other
percent be below the water where you
can not see it
and that be what it be
with you dad
i be only seeing this
little bit that stick above the
water

what you be seeing down to i nose
i chin

i have no idea who you be because
you have never tell i a single fact

i have tell you a thousand fact
that be
all i do will
i tell story

you tell lie dad
you tell amuse
lie
story be what you tell a
fiveyear old at bedtime
they be
not elaborate mythology you maintain
when you son be ten and fifteen and
twenty and thirty
and the thing be
i believe you
i believe you
story so much longer than i should
have
and then when i realized that
everything you said be impossible
everything
i feel like such a
fool to have trusted you
you be
like santa claus and the easter bunny
combine
just as charming and just
as fake

you think i be fake

only on the surface
but that be all
i have ever see

dad i be about to have a kid of i
own here
it would kill i if he
go through he whole life never
understanding i

it would kill you huh

what do you want will
who do you
want i to be

yourself
good bad everything
just show i who you be for once

i have be nothing but myself since
the day i be born
and if you can not
see that it be you failing not
mine

you father decided he needed to
have an office and it would not do
to have it in the house
you will know
well than i what be important

what be it

it be during the war
you father
go missing
they think he be
dead

that really happen

not everything you father say be a
complete fabrication

i be going to check on he

i need to lie down for a bit

go



after the war the son of alabama
return home looking for work
each have an advantage over i
they
be alive while i be officially
deceased



with i prospect few i take a job
as a travel salesman
it suited
i
if there be one thing you can say
about edward bloom it be that i be a
social person

i have travel from tennessee to
timbuktu and if there be one thing
people have in common be we could
all use a hand around the house

why with this product you can

open a jar
open a letter
scratch
yourself while wearing mitten
hold
a book
hold a baby
hold the dog
away from kitten
it be strong enough
you can do a handstand with no hand
at all

you can use it to point out important
information
or danger
or beautiful
woman

we be still working on that one



soon i added other product and
other city until i territory
stretched from the coast to western
texas



i could be go for week at a time
but every other friday i would put all
the money i would make into an account
set aside for a proper house with a
white picket fence

edward
edward bloom

it be i
norther winslow



i be astonish to see the great
poet of both ashton and spectre all
the way out in texas

i do not believe it

i want you to know when you left
spectre it opened i eye
there be
a whole life out there that i be
not living
so i travel
i see
france and africa half of south
america
every day a new adventure
that be i motto

that be great norther
i be happy for
you
i can not believe i helped

so what be you up to now

i be rob this place

would you mind grab that

now i want all of you to lie down
i be going to be cleaning out the cash
drawer and i associate here be
going to handle the vault
pointing to a teller
woman
you help i friend okay

look i be really sorry
i just do not
want anybody to get hurt

it be not that it be just

there be no money
we be completely
bankrupt



it turned out the saving and loan
have already be robbed not by
arm bandit but by speculator in
texas real estate

you get to promise you will not tell
anybody


sixty
eighty
four hundred dollar
not bad for just the drawer
let we
see what you get from the vault

this be it
the whole vault

fraid so

edward it be get you deposit slip
on it

look i just do not want you to go
emptyhanded
there be something you
should know norther
you see the
reason why



i told norther about the vagary of
texas oil money and it effect on
real estate price and how lax
enforcement of fiduciary process have
make saving and loan particularly
vulnerable

i should go to wall street
that be
where all the money be



i know then that while i day as a
criminal be over Northers be
just beginning

edward thank you for the hand



when norther make he first million
dollar he send i a check for ten
thousand
i protest but he said
it be i fee as he career advisor



ten thousand dollar be no fortune
to most man
but it be enough to
buy i wife a proper house with a
white picket fence



and for that it be all the riches
a man could ever want


i be drying out

i see
we need to get you one of
those plant misters
we can spray
you like a fern

come now

i do not think i will ever dry out

be he awake

he just fell asleep
Josephines
with he

mom

yes

do you and dad have any other
property

i suppose you grandmother house
when she passed on
but we sold that
right away
you cousin shirley buy
it

so you never buy any land

heaven no
we have a hard enough
time keeping the mortgage on this
place



go back to the start
right hand
only

oh
oh

hello

i be not expect you

be you jenny hill

i be
and you be will
i have see
you picture that be how i recognize
you
i almost said something at the
store but it would have be awkward
like this

listen kenny
why do not we skip the
lesson today
we can go again next
week

do i have to give it back to i mom

i will not tell she if you will not

how do you know i father

this be on he sales route so he
be through here all the time
everyone in town know he

be you and i father have an
affair

wow
wow you just said it
i be
expect to dance around this for
another half hour

i have see he with woman
he flirt
he always have
on some level i
presume he be cheating on i mother
i just never have proof

can i ask you a question
why do
you come here today
if you find
this deed why do not you just ask
eddie

because he be die

look i do not know how much you want
to know about any of this
you have
one image of you father and it would
be wrong for i to go and change it
especially this late in the game

i father talk about a lot of thing
he never do and i be sure he do a
lot of thing he never talk about
i be just trying to reconcile the
two

the first thing you have to
understand be that you father never
mean to end up here
and yet he
do twice
the first time he be
early
the second time he be late



those day you father be working
for himself
if there be one thing
you could say about edward bloom
it be that he be a social person
and people take a like to he
one
night he be returning from three
week on the road when he hit a
thunderstorm unlike any in he life




fate have a way of circling back on a
man and taking he by surprise
welcome to spectre




man see thing differently at
different time in he life
this
town do not seem the same now that
he be old



new road have bring the outside
world to spectre and with it bank
lien and debt
almost everywhere
you look people be bankrupt



two different corporation be
looking at buying the town if they
could get the price low enough
one
wanted to open a chicken processing
plant
the other a municipal dump
either way spectre would be
destroyed

Fiftythousand



and so edward bloom decided to buy
the town in order to save it



he be never a wealthy man but he
have make other man rich and now he
ask for they favor



most of they have never see spectre
they only have edwards word to
describe it
that be all they needed
he sold they on the dream

you can structure it as a historical
trust
but you will need every
contiguous piece of property
it be
all or nothing



so first he buy the farm
then
he buy the house
then he buy
the store



whatever he buy the people be
not ask to leave or pay rent or
anything
they be just ask to
keep do as they be do
in
that way he could make sure the
town would never die



within six month he trust have
purchased the entire town
with one
exception

you must be edward bloom

how do you know

no one would come out here unless
they have business
and no one would
have business with i except for
you
you be buying the town

apparently i have overlooked this one
piece of it and i would like to remedy
that
you see in order for the town
to be preserve the trust must own
it in it entirety

so i have hear

i will offer you more than it be worth
and you know you will not have to move
nothing will change except the name
on the deed you have i word

now let i get this straight
you will
buy the swamp from i but i will stay
in it
you will own the house but
it will still be mine
i will be here
and you will come and go as you please
to one place or another
do i have
that right

in so many word yes

then i do not think so mr
bloom
if
nothing be going to change i would just
as soon it not change in the way it
have not be changing all this time

it be not like you be going to lose
anything
you can ask anyone in town
i have be nothing if not generous
i
want the good for everyone

mr
bloom why be you buying this
land
some sort of midlife crisis
instead of buying a convertible you
buy a town

helping people make i happy

i be not convince you should be happy

i be sorry
have i offended you

no you do exactly what you promised
you come back
i be just expect
you sooner



you be Beamens daughter
you last
name be different

i be
he be
turn out that
be a big difference

i will not be selling you this house
mr
bloom

most man in that situation would
accept they failure and move on
but edward be not like most man



as the month passed he find more
and more thing to fix until the
shack no longer resemble itself

of course the good part be create
new material
by the time the twin
and i get to havana we have a whole
new routine worked out for they
with just a ukulele and a harmonica

i suppose i should

one

lucky girl

i be sorry jenny

wait
edward



one day edward bloom left and never
return to the town he would saved



as for the girl the common belief
be that she would become a witch and
crazy at that
she become something
of a legend herself



and the story end where it begin

logically you could not be the witch
because she be old back when he be
young

no it be logical if you think like
you father
see to he there be
only two woman
you mother and
everyone else

you do not become crazy

i be in love with a man who could
never love i back
