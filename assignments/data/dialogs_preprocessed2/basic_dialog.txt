fifteen guy quit that day
but not
pike



time go on and the sarge start
singling people out

he would zero in on a fella and ride he
till he quit



those who would not quit he would put in
what he called section eight



washout reject guy he said be
dumbfucks too stupid to know they

section and with good reason too

they figure we be the boy who
meet with a train accident

be you saying sergeant west tried
to kill you

no madam he just wanted we to quit
making it through be kind of an
honor
some of the other guy on
the base told we that if you could
hack section eight command would
consider you at the top of the class

that be not exactly true
i be living proof
how do you get
section ray


that first night with pike

the mistake of letting he sit down
at around

tell we about the other guy the

uncomfortable going to sleep near



pike i told you about
he take the
brunt of it from mueller and west
once they find it out he be a
convict they be merciless




he would be busted for auto theft
judge give he the option of jailor
the army
he make the wrong choice

why would he just surrender

because he have a plan


hey kendall talk to you for a sec

you hated west as much as i do
i be not saying what i do be right
but you can not tell i you be not
glad the motherfucker dead

the thing be we have get a real
opportunity here
you turn i in
tomorrow and we be both fucked

what be you talking about

gay senator son who let he sarge
get fragged on a train exercise
the press crucify you and you
father
he career will be over and
it will be you fault
but we do this
different and you come out a hero

how

mueller
he be as bad as west and we
both know it
now i can not do it
because i be tied up but we get the
other to go along

do not think i want to hear this

someone else can do the deed it
do not have to be you
maybe nunez
too he be get a tendency to follow
mueller but the rest of we can come
out ahead the guy who take out
they sergeant killer


we will move the body out to the
creek and say we come over the hill
right as they fragged west all we
get to do be tell the story right

you be sick pike



later on i
see he talking to dunbar
they have be close
i be in another
room when it happen



i do not think he mean to do it
it
be just reflex he would already be
gutshot
i must have passed out
because next thing i know


and that be it

nunez be chasing dunbar

because he would shoot mueller

but you do not see it right

like i said i be in the kitchen
when i come out mueller and pike
be dead nunez and childs be hit
and dunbar be go

why do he come back for you

i honestly do not know
maybe to
have someone to cover for he
and
i wish i could but there be no doubt
in i mind he killed those man

okay
i think that be it
he rise
and walk to the door

mr
hardy

what do dunbar tell you


pike killed west dunbar killed
mueller childs and nunez

who killed pike

someone must have get a shot off
he be not exactly a moving target

what do you think

it be too neat

too neat
how long have you be
an investigator

i do not think that have anything to
do with

that mean under a year
let i
explain what ten year of police
work have taught i murder be basic
there be no conspiracy no grand
mystery and no evil puppet master
behind it all pulling the string
murder be shitty people do a shitty
thing to other shitty people it
do not always make sense but it be
always neat
dunbars we guy

i just
he come back for kendall
i do not think he be capable of murder

everyone capable of murder osborne


look all we have get be what kendall
say and he do not actually witness
any death except nunez
he find
west he see mueller and pike but
just they body he do not see
any crime committed

well i be sure if he would known this
be all going to happen he would have
try harder to witness it for you

wests body be not in the creek bed

we have already be over the terrain
twice
nothing

there be a hurricane bill the
wind probably moved it

Habeas corpus you have to have a
body to have a crime

okay then let we widen the search
to include the endzone in giant
stadium and the trunk of i car

without the body we have no physical
proof
we need a confession

from dunbar
i hate to break this
to you but i do not think he be going to
be all that psych to put himself
in for the death penalty

nevertheless

nevertheless whata
kendall will
testify and that be enough

not for i


you mean not enough to save you

get here in three hour
try
for the confession

hey ray
just have a nice talk with
you buddy
kendall seem you
killed three people

that son of a bitch

that would be i reaction too

he be lying

well why do not you say so
we will
just drop all you charge then

i be serious

fuck you be serious raymond you
get exactly zero truck with we
right
now we would take the word of a crackhead
over yours so if you have get something
to say say it

do kendall tell you about the

he said he worked there

no do he tell you about it
about
the business childs run

what business


pill shot you name it basic a
lot easy when you do not feel pain

so childs make some side money so
what
people be dead ray and the
only one we have to blame be you

do not shoot west

yeah we know pike do

you think you know everything do not
you
you have not even scratch the
surface

i know enough to know you get two
choice you can sign a confession
in which case you will probably spend
the rest of you life in a military
prison or you can tell we to fuck
off in which case you will probably
get the gas chamber
be i scratching you surface yet

hardy

why the fuck be not he in restraint

tom where be you going

home i be do

going to be swimming in blood
look at
i uniform

way i figure it west must have find
out about they little business and
be going to bust they so they decided
to get rid of he first

they

mueller and childs
one of they
must have taken the grenade from i
pack on the chopper



then mueller ditch i during the
exercise and head for the creek



he blow the grenade to frame i and
get west to come running


what the fuck be going on


do not know sir i

childs job be easy he only have to
delay kendall long enough for mueller
to get away





now all mueller have to do be get rid
of the evidence



and wait for everyone else to arrive

i
i do not know

ballistics can match you weapon to
the slug in sergeant wests body

shut up

do not do this

test will no doubt link you to the
kill

put it down

tell he to shut up

failure to comply with this arrest
be a court martialable offense in
and of itself


pike please

although that will not matter much when
couple with the murder charge



you stupid white trash motherfucker
i see you do it

oh

i god

he would not
stop talking

so you killed he

i



get that hand away

you too


we can still come out of this okay
pike get free he get a gun he come
after we
that be the story

west be one thing but this

shut up mueller

you framedhim

none of that matter now
we get
two dead body and a story that
explain they
you be either with
we or against we which be it

okay




and then i killed the last of they

can i have some coffee

yeah
yeah sure

you shoot childs and nunez

they would have killed we both
you
want i to write a confession i will
write a confession

you saved Kendalls life

but not pike

why do not you tell we all this in
the first place


would you have believe i

where be the cabin

do not know on a map
west told we
it be there we just find it
maybe the hurricane take it away

raymond for you to have any chance
of coming out of this we need to
locate the other body and examine
they to corroborate you testimony
otherwise this be just another story

mr
hardy i joined the army for
college money
i do not ask for any
of this i tried to do the right
thing out there and people get killed
you say finding those body help
i then go find they
i do not want
to die

talk it through
childs mueller
and nunez know they be going out on
the regular tuesday night drill
hurricane or ho hurricane so they
plan it
kill west pin it on pike

and they be smart about it
they
know when you commit a crime you
know be going to be investigate
you need a fall guy and for that to
work you have to have a witness

dunbar

exactly someone who be not involve
who be word can not be question
you
only let they see what you want they
to see you make they believe so
when the time come they have totally
buy into you version of event


they believe the innocent be guilty
and the guilty be innocent

and if they be ask that be what
they will tell the world

so it be a good plan but it go wrong
mueller flip out and shoot they
fall guy which mean they have to
bring dunbar and kendall into the
cover story

kendall maybe would have agreed but
the hurricane buttfucks the cabin

Buttfucks the cabin

and all hell break loose
lot of
good guy shoot a lot of bad guy
and whiz bang zoom happy end

so why after dunbar drag kendall
out from under a house do the
senator son try and get we to put
he savior in the gas chamber

that bug you too

little bit

let we go talk to bill

fucking asthma
this whole thing
driving it nut

what i said before


be dead right
you think dunbars
on the level

yeah

do osborne agree

yes sir i do

dunbars confession
it should be
enough to get you out of trouble

you want kendall do not you

he tried to burn dunbar to we
you
do not do that if you be not involve

you both know if you do this if you
go after a senator son and you be
wrong
it be not just i in the hot
seat anymore

we know

i be giving you a chance to walk away

we know

you do not get to be a colonel without
compromise
without get out
of the way of the big dog
you
politic play it safe think of the
career first
and when thing get
dirty you just look the other way


four of i man be dead
you think
kendall have something to do with it
then you go get the son of a bitch

pike never confess

we have be making progress i see

running out of time be we
tick
tock ticktock how long till you
witness fly the coop

fifty minute

not much time to solve the crime
tell i detective how do it feel
taking blood money from Guissepe
torres
do it weigh on you
conscience or do you just not think
about it

you tried to pin three stone murder
on dunbar

how many murder do you cover up

there be that word again
as i told you i be not in the room
when everyone start shooting

i be just think of what be going
to happen to you career when i
father get through with you

why do not you talk to levi off the
record for a second

good idea


you and dunbar get you story
straight
little detail little
inconsistency design to bounce
we back from one of you to the other
asking question killing time until
the transport arrive and whisk you
away to where senator daddy can
protect you
you think you be just
going to slide out of this
you be
an accessory to murder levi you be
go to jail

you can not threaten i

jail if he be lucky the gas chamber
if he be not

do not do anything

it do not matter levi
we be going
to find those body and when we do
i be going to make sure one of they
have a bullet in they that match
you weapon

what

that be a fantastic idea

see i just take you gun to the
morgue and fire it into one of they
skull
then i call every newspaper
in the country with the story about
how senator Kendalls gay son go
nut on a train mission

it will not work

it will and you know why


because you be not a person anymore
you be a cadet in the united states
army
you have no identity no miranda
warn and no right
so i be going to
throw you to the wolf and unlike
you i be going to get away with it
because you be pissing i off

enjoy you flight to washington

wait

what

dunbars telling the truth

wrong answer

we do get we story straight but
not because we killed anyone
it be because i threatened he

why

because of what i see
who really killed west

who killed sergeant west

who levi

childs


how do you know

because i be standing next to he

i be in on the thing
he and
mueller and i we be making
thousands
west find out
childs
said we be just going to scare he
use i dad clout
i have this whole
speech prepared about how if he rat
we he career be over
we meet he
in the creek bed but before i said
anything

i swear i do not know he be going to
do it
after he told i we be
going to pin it on pike one of we
big customer



Nobodyd believe the word of a black
junkie excon against ours



he told i i would well keep quiet or
i would end up the same as west



dunbar do not know anything about
any of it
everything he told you
be true except after




i told he what have really happen
to west
tell he to keep quiet
about it or i would destroy he
because
if it come out that i be involved
with the whole scam i father
would be finished

i scare dunbar into silence
he be
be trying to cover for i the whole
time
we get here you come to see
i
i do not know if i could trust
he with that kind of secret

so you frame he
the same way
childs be going to frame pike

little advice levi next time you
frame a guy pick someone who can not
defend themselves

what happen with nunez

he come after we
and i told dunbar
he have to kill he

do it

and he do


that be how you do good copbad cop

childs do it huh

first pike then mueller now childs
when be we get to the other
when be we going to hear about nunez

or dunbar

or you levi
when be it finally
going to come out that you be the
one who killed he

i do not

but you can not prove it
you can not
prove anything until we find the
body

you lie to we levi you be going
to the gas chamber unless you tell
we where to find they

i do not know

where be they

maybe






get something between he tooth

shit

what be

he be an epileptic

you be going to have to wait outside

he be a witness

it do not matter outside

FFFFFFFuh

he be trying to say something

out

FuhFuhFuhFuhFuh




FuhFucking pike

i push he too hard

you could not have known

yeah i could have
should have

you wanted to get the truth

no i do not
i wanted to humiliate
he
for what he do to dunbar
for fucking over the little guy

you mean the falsely accuse

you wanted to break he

yeah

so do i

it be over
time of death be



jags be notify and i called the
senator myself
i report will
reflect that he medical condition
make this unavoidable
you two have
no culpability in the matter

that be horseshit and you know it

but it be i fault and i will
carry it

we find the cabin
demolish
like they said
no body
hurricane
like that coulda scooped they up
drop they down two county over
we will find they

you think you could explain all this
to i

i would not know where to start
i guess it be about one man frame
another
he think if the other
guy get blame people would over
look he own wrong doing

what happen to dunbar now

which mean you two be do

suppose to be a nation found on
the principle of questioning
authority

plus i get kick out

for what

that be going to stay i secret

it be
you who west single out

you who get hook by Muellers
morphine

you who do it all

you wanted revenge on west revenge
on they all so you killed they



but that be not enough
you needed
a new identity because no one be
going to believe james randall pike
convict felon have act so nobly
in the face of danger you needed a
name people could trust one that
have not be to jail one that have not
publicly be wests bitch boy


you keep kendall alive to corroborate
you story and he do it all they
way up to the end
you even give
he he own motive in case we decided
to burn he too

can not do that now though can you

you walk into the army a convict
felon with a sentence of five year
in a uniform and be going walk out
eight week later with a different
name a clean record and an honorable
discharge a guy who do everything
he could to save he friend

be that what i do now
and of
course you can prove all of it

we can prove that you be not ray
dunbar
impersonate a fellow cadet
be a courtmartial in and of itself

do i ever claim i be raymond dunbar
be i ever told to state i name
rank and serial number for the record

you assumed who i be because
i be wearing this uniform

oh you do not
what else do you
have on i
you have not find any
body yet have you

we have find all of they

you think it be easy to have all that
morphine just disappear without a
high up authorizing it
check the
requisition order i will lay money
it be he signature on they



that be he game see
ride the
cadet so hard they would need something
to stay on they foot
then he would
send mueller or kendall to they
waving around they magic needle
promising to make it all go away

it be not a new thing either
he would
be do this for year


every nine week a new class of
cadet new potential customer
the amount of money involved over
that period of time
this be some
high stake shit

dunbar moved his through the kitchen
i worked in the motor pool and hook
all the mechanic
by the time the
hurricane hit we be all in
some
use some pushing some both
but
then something happen
west hear
one of we be about to talk to blow
he whole operation
he figure
he would make enough money have enough
of the army maybe it be time to
disappear
but first he be going to
teach we one last thing



the tuesday night drill be the
perfect cover
the hurricane make
it even well



he put we on the chopper and fly we
to he cabin
and then he told we

gentleman
it have come to i
attention that there be a traitor in
we midst
someone who be going to
break the code of fraternal
brotherhood that i have endeavore
to create in all of you
perhaps
that failure be mine
but we take
care of we own
and this traitor
must be make to pay


run

sir i be not

i know you be
cadet mueller find
the letter you would written to the
colonel in you locker
you be
going to betray we all
now run

now we will see whose train paid
off the most
you be to hunt cadet
nunez down and bring he body back
to i
if you fail and he escape
we all go down together



it be insanity
we be hunting a
man down to kill he



he get mueller first


roberto



he take he gun
used it on childs



i can not imagine what it be like
have you friend try to kill you



but you do what you have to survive



kendall and i find dunbar a couple
minute later



it come to i in a split second
change clothes change identity
if james pike get discharge he
go right back to jail
but if i
be dunbar i could walk away from
all this with a new life
but then


put it down

i just want to go

you be going to kill i pike
thought
you be i friend

i have to get kendall to a hospital

he be going to kill i too

i snap Muellers neck
he be i
good friend and i have to snap his
neck because he be going to shoot i
for drug
for west

we do not have to do this
you go
that way i will go this way

you will shoot i in the back

you killed three people
be not that
enough for one night

i do not want to die out here roberto
do you


if you even twitch

forgive i


congratulations cadet pike
you
get the gold star

fuck you

you would best get he out of here
do not worry about the body they will
be taken care of

this be where we part way cadet
you tell they i die out here or
i will come back for you
tell they
one of the other do i
mueller
childs i do not care who
you and
kendall you tell they a story
you can tell a story can not you


dismiss

i guess nunez be not dead after all
he come after we with a vengeance
you know the rest

and the body

you will not find they
will not find
west either
he be too good

no body no west

no death certificate
no crime

just four people
silence

you will testify to this the
corruption the drug scam

we can cut a deal for you on the
nunez killing

i do not want any deal


if you be telling the truth the
requisition record will prove it

all the proof you need will be when
west come back and put a bullet in
i brain
but i will do it
i be a
dead man anyway
like kendall
we both should have die out there
with we brother
i know that now

i will take he now if you do not mind

tell i detective
do you get
what you wanted

not even close

tom

we need to talk

seven

what


seven guy
what be it you said
you be just starting to believe i
be not the guy people said

seven
that be the answer to Kendalls
question
how many
seven

this be not the time

this be the perfect time
you know
what make a good detective
the
number of confession they get
you be a good detective osborne
so now you get mine

what if i do not want it

tough

thing about taking money be you
do not have to do anything
you just
sit there
maybe you do not return a
phone call
maybe you do not follow
up a lead
but that be it
keep the
money you work do

seven unsolved murder
and you
know what
it do not weigh on i
conscience
not one goddamn bit

that be not true

there be degree of truth officer
always degree


you be a good man hardy

really

far as i be concern whatever you
do in the past can stay in the past

i may not be grow on you but
you be sure as hell growing on i

and because you be a good man i
know you will do the right thing

pike never make it to

somebody
take he off the plane before it
left
i guess be he be already dead

west

nobody see
but i do not think so

these be the requisition from the
the one used to release the
drug to mueller
west signed half
of they pike be telling the truth
look who signed the other half

do i have a choice in this

yeah
i can wait till you be off
the base and do it myself


fuck it
let we go finish this

you have to get out of the way of
the big dog
that be good

tom be that you

it be so good i actually forget
you be one of the big dog now
the base commander
the one in
control

what be you talking about

if you let he testify then it would
have all come out
west be suppose
to take care of it out there shut
nunez up and then disappear
but it
get messy and people get killed
so
you called you old pal tom hardy
figure if bad come to bad
he would cover for you

you be drink

i be not going to cover for you bill
not for this

look


stay where you be

or what
you have go round the bend

west have a partner
someone who
know how to get thing do

what i can not understand be why you
signed these
if you would just let
west take care of the paperwork no
one would have known but you get
careless
so when pike finally tell
the truth you have to get rid of he
too

that be preposterous

toxicology report come back
Kendalls attack be cause by a
drug known as anephadrine maybe
you have hear of it
it be for
asthmatic
if an epileptic take
enough it kill they
i checked
with the nurse at the hospital
you be the only other person who
visit kendall

want to see if he be okay

you poisoned he bill
you hear
we interrogation you know he be
ready to crack so you killed he
just like pike

i be not even going to dignify that

no
you will stand there and you
will listen
what happen to you
bill
you be the one who joined
up to do good in the world
you
be the one who believe in it


you want to get into a finger pointing
contest about character
the army
kick you out for drug the cop
fired you for taking bribe from a
mobster and you think you can stand
there and lecture i on code of
conduct
there be only one criminal
standing in this room and it be you

not for long

no more witness
wests a ghost
but it do not matter because we
have you signature the hospital
log and Kendalls toxicology report
and that be enough

you be crazy

you can not duck this bill
i may
have do every goddamn thing in i
life wrong but i will not let this
happen

for the last time i have no idea
what you be talking about

get you hand away from the desk

osborne gun


it be wests be not it

now it be over

what be you do out here

leaving without saying goodbye
what be you going to do

go home get drink and try and forget
this ever happen

think it will work

nah

want company

word of advice about woman that
first hour or so after they kill
they boss
probably not the good
time to hit on they

i should probably write that down

yeah


you phone number


in case you need i to testify about
the shoot
they will clear you

he be you friend

yeah
but he be a lot of other
thing too
thanks

i will see you

hey hardy

i owe you this

you saved i life tonight
keep it
actually do not keep it i need the
money

you be one of the good one osborne
do not sweat the detail

welcome cadet
the art of warfare
be simple and complex
simple in
it goal complex in it execution


as sun tzu write the true warfare
be deception

at all time you must confuse you
enemy surrounding they with
uncertainty giving they false hope

at all time you must mask you
true intention



Whyd you ask for a cop ray



they get they story straight



what the fuck be going on

you weapon sergeant


be this about that little drug
business you all be running
yeah
i know about that roberto told i

shut up
look we will not say anything

fuck that
you little pissers really
think you can throw a scare into i

you be going to have to do a lot well
than that son



how about this

do not i kick you ass out for this
drug thing fifteen year ago

should have known you be involved in
this
come on then
let we see you
try and stick i

stem to sternum
you taught i well
sarge



you think you could explain all this
to i



i would not know where to start




i guess it be about one man frame
another



when you commit a crime you know be
going to be investigate you need a
fall guy




the one who will not talk be trade
live fire with the dead one as we
reach the pickup

and for that to work you have to
have a witness



someone who be not involved who be
word can not be question

you only let they see what you want
they to see you make they believe




they believe the innocent be guilty
and the guilty be innocent



and if they be ask that be what
they will tell the world

you great weapon will by you
ally



i brand
must be i lucky day





some of which you may have to
sacrifice for the great good



we get the toxicology report





make no mistake the innocent will
die






next time you frame a guy pick
someone who can not defend themselves
but it will not be in vain
sometimes you can trick the enemy
into do you work for you





he still carry those gun



if you engage in a clever enough
subterfuge



what i can not understand be why you
signed these



you never told i why you get kick
out of



the army kick you out for drug



i get a friend with an in at the
can hook you up



there be only one criminal stand
in this room and it be you

which bring we to the simple goal
for the true warrior the one and
only objective be to emerge from
conflict unscathed




i promised they i would ask you where
west and the other be



washout reject guy he said be
dumbfucks too stupid to know they
dead



he be telling the truth up to a
point



you can not prove anything until we
find the body

all we get to do be tell the story
right



you have not find any body yet
have you







Habeas corpus you have to have a
body to have a crime

thank you




you can tell a story can not you



murder be basic



there be no conspiracy no grand
mystery no evil puppet master
behind it all pulling the string

everyone capable of murder osborne

be you ready for this
