the point of view of the help
these colored woman raise white
child and then twenty year
later those child become the
employer
it be that irony miss

i be listening

margaret mitchell glorified the
mammy figure who dedicate she
whole life to a white family but no
one
ever ask mammy how she feel
about it
there be both undisguised
hate for white woman and an
inexplicable love but nobody ever
talk about it down here

so a side to this never before

skeeter who be you talking to in
there

go
away

so yes they side of the story


who be that

i mother
she just drop by to

would ever tell you the truth
that be a hell of a risk in a place
like jackson mississippi
i
watch they try to integrate you
bus station on the news
oy

jammed fiftyfive negroe in a jail
build for four

i already have a maid

negro maid have already
agreed to talk to you

you come up with
the book biz
could use a little rattling

i be saying i will let you know if
it be even worth pursue

oh thank you miss stein

and for god sake you be a twenty
fouryearold educated woman
go
get an apartment


dear miss myrna how do i remove
the ring from i fat slovenly
husband shirt collar when he be
such a pig and sweat like one
too


which one she want a get rid of
they ring or the husband

tell she a vinegar and PineSol
soak
then let it set in the sun a
bit

bout an hour
let it dry

build it just like the one at i
house right against the garage
