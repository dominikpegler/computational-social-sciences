the Treadstone project have actually
already be terminated
it be
design primarily as a sort of
advance game program

good train platform but quite
honestly for a strictly theoretical
exercise we think it be far too
expensive
the costbenefit ratio
be just too high
it be be all but
decommission at this point

all right what be next

Blackbriar
be a joint communication
program that we really feel have good
traction to it
