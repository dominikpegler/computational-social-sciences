order in the court

order in the court i say


have a seat

do you know why you be here today
mr
stevens

why be i here

be you be rhetorical

be you asking i

you stand here today an accuse
man

accuse
accuse of what

you have be place in custody of
you child

huh

you child mr
stevens
you do
realize you have child do not
you

yes but

but nothing mr
stevens either you
have child or you do not

i do

so you accept responsibility for
bringing young life into the world

i guess














on top of that you told this court
that you accepted the
responsibility of have say
child do you not

yes but

then why mr
stevens do you
continue to deny culpability in
this situation

answer the question

answer the question

the question mr
stevens

how can you be sure it be i

she picked you out of a lineup
sir
what more do you need

time

time be not an option mr
stevens
time be not an option

you do not deny be marry to ms
stevens nor do you deny the act of
procreation
you seem to understand
that you action bear consequence
you seem to understand that with
parenthood come responsibility


it seem to i as it should to
anyone with the capacity for simple
deduction that you mr
stevens
do willingly and knowingly enter
into the commitment of parenthood
fully aware of the potential
pratfall
do you not

yes yes i do

it be time to pay the piper mr
stevens
it be the recommendation of the
state that richard
stevens be
sentence to the full capacity
allow by law

what about cindy

excuse i

i ex cindy what about she
responsibility to the child

she cut a deal rick
you be the
one we wanted
you be the one we
get
she take the plea
sure it
cost she financially
but what be
freedom worth

i see no reason to extend this any
**further/far
mr
stevens you have be
find competent by the state and by
this court
you be completely
cognizant of you surroundings and
you leave i no choice
this court
find you guilty as charged

guilty of what


you be hereby remand to custody
of you child for no less than a
lifetime
this court be adjourn

i can not do this alone
do not make
i do this alone
i will never make
it

if you can not do the time mr
stevens then do not do the crime


highly effective strategy of time
management for the single parent


learn it
live it

marry man

i do not know
maybe

tonight


no problem

who be that

that be you daddy

i love daddy


be he coming home

no he be going to be late
he have a
date

so i guess you have to deal with
i a little while longer

yeah


you be a single father
that be
wonderful
so many man refuse to
accept any responsibility for they
kid
so how many do you have

um
three

that be amazing
i be sure they be
just angel




i sister have three
she said when
the second one be born it double
the work
she do not realize the
third would double the work load
would again
and to think you do it
all by yourself

um
kinda

you be a terrific man
do i tell
you i love kid
they love i
it
just come so instinctively even
though i have never have kid myself
i get lots of practice with i
nephew though
so when can i meet
you boy


you be not i mom

yeah


you can not





guy like you be so hard to find
i think i love you and i think you
need to love i too









that be incredible

yeah

i know i have not known you very
long but i there be something i
need to say


be it something i said





do you have a good time

yeah it be good
kinda okay
pretty much suck

what happen

why can not i find a woman like you

you be trying too hard

i feel bad for the boy
they do not
have a mom
she will always be
they mother but she will never be
they mom

quit trying so hard
you be forcing
issue that can not be forced
relax
everything happen when and how
it be suppose to
it be about spirit
and finding the will to love again
for you and the boy

you want to stay and

i be going to get

go

yeah

you sure

positive


daddy i have to potty

i will see you tomorrow

ok


nicky almost do it

almost baby boy
almost



finally have to grow up

you have get direction

i suppose
i do not know if you would
call it direction but there be a
definite sense of purpose


good for you

yeah but be it good for the kid

do the kid have direction


only two kind of people make it in
this world boy
those that be
smart and those that be strong
if
you do not want to be smart and do
you homework then you can be
strong and do pushups


i be probably not as demanding of
they as i should be

you have to instill a sense of
direction at a very early age


so phillip what do you want to be
when you grow up


daddy say i can do three thing
when i grow up

and what be those
phillip take a
deep breath

jury sit right there
and the
audience be filled with all these
people who do not really give a
shit about i

bunch of innocent bystander

and they all sit pass judgement
on i not knowing the situation
just stare over they schoolmarm
spectacle and pointing they
crook finger

all the world a stage

always casting dispersion

guilty as charged

do you hear that

hear what

nothing
nothing at all



the secret of life melanie be to
always pay attention

always be prepared for what be
right around the corner
the
of the bat

duck

huh
