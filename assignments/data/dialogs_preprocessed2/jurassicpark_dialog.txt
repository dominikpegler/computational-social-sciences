
first draft
by

rewrite by


as the tip of a finepointed drill bore into the amber


right calcaneus of an adult female
raptor
mild stress fracture
what be
this tell i

it tell i that this bone connect to
the navicula which we already find
articulate to the cuboid

dr
grant
dr
grant

dr
Sattler
dr
grant be think

so what can we stay for sure
stress
fracture in the heel

she jump

right as rain ellie
now why do she
jump

defensive posture against a vicious
bloodthirsty TRex

perhaps
or maybe to select the small
more tender leave in the high branch
with which to suckle she young

i bet be be a mate ritual

the science of paleontology can not answer
these question
novelist and artist
who dream a vision of the jurassic period
can attempt these question with they
imagination
what we scientist can say
be consider the mass and kinetic
articulation of these bone this animal
have a vertical leap
of about twelve foot
not as entertain as fiction but
absolutely fact without prejudice

excuse i dr
grant
but
fact be
we be late
there be the car

jim you keep making up the plaster
batch
whatever ratio you be use
it be perfect
nora no digging after
five when the temperature drop those
bone be just too brittle
bill i
do not want any tourist walking over i
raptor i do not care if the governor of
montana be with they just you guy

you know if ev
method like you there would be no body
of theory no quasar no big bang

jesus a limousine
we be reentering
hammonds world that be for sure

remind i why we be do this ellie

we be leaving the raptor dig

at a critical time

because gennaro be paying we sixty
thousand dollar to observe some resort
of hammonds in costa rica
and that be

enough money to keep we free of
commercial affiliation for two summer
all right all right
good

financial
independence for fraternize
with the enemy
i will do it

this be all could come up with skip

wise guy
let we go ellie

five hundred thousand be peanut

i be not renege
i be reevaluate

you think i be a scumbag i know

look pal you make a career in biogenetic
industrial espionage and you be bound to
run across a scumbag or two
guaranteed
part of the job description
look who be
to say who be the real scumbag
after
all i know what you guy need so bad
i have hear of reverse engineering

let the other guy put in all the work
all the and
you take the finish
product work backwards breaking it down
to reveal it genetic code
presto
in
a few measly month you have knowhow
that take researcher ten year to
determine
you know how much hammond have
invested of he own personal wealth
over five billion dollar
and if you
guy get the jump on he in no time
the market wideopen

but boy he be really get he product
oh yes siree massive gargantuan money
making neverheardofprofitlikethat
product
it be a sight
yes indeedy

scumbag
we have a deal
that deal be
not open to renegotiation
or even re
evaluation

the deal stand
take it or leave it

i will give you a few minute to decide

make sure the egg be on that supply
ship
just make sure

we can not trust hammond anymore
he be
under too much pressure
there be the
he be behind schedule and the in
vestors be get nervous
there have
be too many rumor too many accident
we can not screw around with this

i have ask hammond to arrange independent
site inspection every week for the next
three week

what do he say

insist nothing wrong on the island

you know he
do you believe he

no i do not
i spent a lot of time with
he five year ago when we raised the
capital
and it be a wild ride
he be
unpredictable a dreamer

potentially dangerous
we should never
have get involve
what be we position

the firm own five percent

general or limit

general

we should have never do that

it seem wise at the time
we all
wanted the park to happen
it be in
lieu of fee

in any case i agree an inspection be
overdue
who be you site expert

will they tell the truth

i think so
that guy grant a hotshot
in he field always go he own way

good
you be making all the arrangement

hammond ask to place the call himself
i think he want to pretend the park be
not in trouble
that it be just a social
invitation showing off the island

all right
good
but let we be very
clear about one thing
i do not know how
bad this situation actually be donald
but if there be a problem on that island
do not be afraid to screw hammond and burn
jurassic park to the ground

costa rica i ass

that be isla Nublar
buckle up the
descent be a little hairy

this be exciting

what be ellie
where be we going

look like alcatraz

there be bad wind shear on this peak
smile excitedly as the helicopter start down
now

how the hell be he landing this thing

this be not fun

relax ellie
i be sure they would not
land if it be not safe

gennaro
this guy know what he be do
right
hey gennaro
i be talking to you

no problem
relax relax

whoa

i do not like this feel

just think gennaro
you get to agree it be funny
these two
they dig up dinosaur
it be wonderful
be not it

dr
bone you be going to love this place

come on folk
get to get back there be a
storm alert

hi
ed regis
real big welcome to isla
Nublar dr
grant dr
Sattler
little
tough land here i know
but you do
it
come on down we be so happy to have
you
now watch you step

this be robert muldoon great african big
game hunter
and he be working for we now
do a bangup job too

ed a little more than
mr
gennaro nice to have you back
call to regis but be ignore

mr
regis what be the nature of this park

aggressive growth huh

hammonds trademark

out animal be greeting you

i hope this be not one of those animatronic
exhibit in a jurassic botanical set

nope

i hope you bring you bthe suit
do not this mist and these plant really
create a bonafide prehistoric feel

there be the visitor center

where be hammond

mr
hammond be dying to see you guy

hot hot hot
ten billion buck and the
air conditioning suck

the audicity of man to get here at the
last second and think he run the show



please come to the theater
in a moment
we film will begin
gennaro stand in the back and smoke

welcome lady and gentleman
welcome
to an ancient and mysterious world a
world long before humankind inhabit it
with all out remarkable dream and
question
enter a world that exist
one hundred million year ago
when we
changing earth be the abode of
magnificent creation
today the late twentieth century have
witness a scientific gold rush of
astonishing proportion
the headlong
and furious haste to un
of genetic engineering have become more
than just a subject for science fiction
writer

the furious haste to commercialize
genetic engineering

biotechnology promise the great
revolution in human history
it will
outdistance atomic power and computer in
it effect on we everyday live
we will
see square tree for easy lumber and
white trout for super visibility to
fisherman
why it will transform every
aspect of human life
out medical care
we food we health even we very
entertainment

here we go

it be literally going to change the face
of we planet as we know it

jurassic park
what we do here be
make possible through the miracle of
replication commonly known as cloning
to explain what cloning mean i be going
to need i own clone john hammond

hi john

hi john

okay john hold out you finger

why

i need some of you
genetic material

now just a minute here john

you genetic material be the same in
every cell of you body
you have a
hundred billion cell
you will not miss a
couple


that hurt
hey what be

john let we look into you blood the
river of life
there be you white cell
exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
waste
and there be a mighty nucleus
the heart and brain of a cell
this
nucleus have an amazing property
it can
sp
that be how it grow
and then those two
can do it again
and again
making copy
after copy of itself

hi i be john hammond
hey i be john
hammond
no i be
i be

come on that be enough of this
and i
think to reproduce myself i have to do it
the oldfashion way

that be all we have get so far
lot of
fun be not it mr
gennaro

you bet

it be be a long time alan
i know the
precede be not you sort of enter
tainment
popular science

no i do not mind popular science
i dislike
the commercialization of science
it breed
a sloppiness a disregard for method

well i do not disregard method
but think
of mutation which be nothing more than
sloppy communication on the cellular
level
think how triumphant mutation
have be in natural selection
oh but i know what you be saying
it be
true that i have never be afraid to make
money with science
i have always
considered profit to be a measure of
success a barometer of public reaction

mr
hammond the essential truth of a
scientific law ha
public reaction
water freeze at
thirtytwo degree whether you pay for
it or not

donald in bringing i old friend alan
grant you have bring an excellent critic
to observe the viability of i island and
out venture
i look forward to winning
you over dr
grant

just what be it you be trying to clone

grandpa

mr
hammond this be a serious investiga
tion of the island not a weekend
excursion or a social outing
we be
talking about the safety of this place

i be aware of that
but i build this
place for child
you can not
investigate it without they reaction
they be what this place be all about

i grandchildren
genetics be kind
they be more like i exwife than i

who make a window
small

i know you
you write i book
lose
world of the dinosaur
it be awesome

Timmys get dinosaur on the brain

do not worry he will grow out of it

dr
grant embarrass that he book be
so widely successful
he write if for
gra

although dr
grant suspect otherwise
this be not an i willconceived halfbaked
poorly fund plan that i have headed
this be a plan to which i committed all
of i personal resource literally
billions of dollar
and donald gennaro
here have kindly helped i raise that sum
again from wealthy japanese
they love
theme park
i have recruited pre
eminent scientific mind from hallowed
university and we have taken the time to
do thing right

jurassic park be the most advance
amusement park in the world
we work
with genetics life essential build
block to create new
to make biological attraction
live
attraction
attraction so astonishing
that they would capture the imagination of
the entire world

what exactly do you mean
biological
attraction

as you well know long ago creature ten
time large than whale roam we
adolescent earth
and then mass
mysterious extinction created a time
barrier unscalable until
now

yes

dinosaur
i have be clon dinosaur

lady and gentleman jurassic park
not
a resort not a scien
just a little piece of prehistory that
every child in the whole wide world will
insist on visiting

at least every rich child

Apatosaurs in the lowland
Gallimimus in
the grassy plain
Dilophosaurus above
the river
the mighty tyrannosaurus rex
fabulous creature so far

real dinosaur grandpa
do not they want
to just kill each other

timmy there be electric fence and moat
and video surveillance at all time
there
be monitor every hundred foot
whatever we could plant they on the
island
computer to tabulate it all

you created dinosaur
who give you the
right to do that

i do not create they
i find a way to
wake they up to stir they out of they
prehistoric slumber

we do not have the science
there be no
source of dinosaur

yes
there be

glitch

and this be the right side of i brain
the entire park be safely controlled from
here
john arnold that genius over
there be the m
john do not smoke so much you be far too
valuable a man to i

oh you would survive just fine without i

Everythings controlled from here
remote everything
car feeding
program medicine dispenser fecal
clean up and that can be ton in a park
like this
we run this place with twenty
worker
this computer do it all
and
it police each and every single animal
out there

who police the computer

that be where i will watch the astonish
watcher
okay let we go

thanks for the kind word mr
hammond

come on dennis he know you technical
contribution have make it all possible

right

that stuff turn you into a mutant

do not mind the sign
they be only legal
precaution

i laboratory lex
it will be yours and
Timmys someday

it be
gold

it be amber
fossilize tree sap

grandpa find gold

you be both right
amber be we gold
the alpha or we alchemic alphabet
the
precious course of we genetic material
you already know amber be the fossilize
resin of prehistoric tree sap of course
hammond set the scene

imagine millions of year ago tree sap
flowing over insect as it do now as i
speak in thousands of forest and backyard
tree everywhere
imagine that ancient sap
trapping a little struggling insect and
consume it in a syrupy death
millions
and millions of year pass and we come
along and discover this prehistoric insect
if we be lucky he be perfectly preserve in
a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
be now amber
and as we examine more and
more amber we find many perished insect
include among they biting insect

like mosquito

like mosquito precisely dr
grant

mosquito that suck the blood of
dinosaur
that be you source of
material
i god
it just might work

the extraction room speak for itself

it do

that be a million year old mosquito

put in a piece of amber find a mosquito
drill it out
right

right
you be witnessing the extraction
of tissue from the thorax of this humble
insect
if this mosquito have ingest any
foreign red blood cell say it bite a
hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a TRex we
will extract those blood cell and obtain
paleoDNA the howtobuild instruction
book of an extinct creature
so you see ellie i be not create dino
saurs
fossil left behind the information
the map of how to bring they back
i be
helping they escape from the confine of
time

but even thousands of mosquito would not
give you enough tissue to determine a
complete strand

right you be dr
grant
more like
hundreds of thousands of mosquito be
necessary to provide even a partial
strand of
and without a complete
strand we do not have a dinosaur

ah i know you two would hit it off
dr
grant this be dr
wu i chief geneticist

finally you be here
i have be working
without the encouragement of i peer for
too long
welcome welcome

mr
hammond never let we i publish and
he be interest only in result not in
science

do not forget to thank i when you pick up
you nobel prize

you be standing in the middle of the
most powerful genetics factory created
since the expulsion from eden

these be HamachiHood automate gene
sequencer those be cray XMPs
supercomputer that take information
and organize it
in this room we take
fragmented or incomplete strand and
compare they to other incomplete strand

it be like finding the miss piece of a
jigsaw puzzle

the computer make sever
calculation to provide we with a
complete strand the genetic code of
an extinct animal

okay you have you complete
strand
how do you grow it

we use unfertilized crocodile ova as we
breed medium

we primordial soup

and how do you know what it be you be
grow

well we have computer technique to try
and map out find on an evolutionary
basis
but mostly we just grow it and
find out what it be
if it be something
we be interest in and it
keep it

and if you be not interest

come look

this be the incubation room
we keep the
temperature at ninetynine degree and a
relative humidity of one hundred percent

jurassic atmosphere

we
also run a high oxygen concentration
up to thirtythree percent so if you
feel faint please tell i right away

i be
melt

reptile egg contain large amount of
yolk but no water at all
the embryo
must extract water from the surround
environment

that be why you create the mist

child please do not touch
the egg
be permeable to skin oil

what kind of egg be these
be these
shell plastic

yes they be the embryo be
mechanically insert and then hatch in
this room
but we have managed to
sufficiently mimic the actual biological
process these creature rupture the
plastic membrane that they be contained
in when they be born
like real birth

egg that be determined viable spend
they last couple day in we specially
design incubator which help
accelerate the prenatal developmental
stage
which be interesting becaus
we be have a problem with the adult
animal

there be no problem dr
wu can not handle
now who want to see the real thing

so naturally hammonds going to
present everything in the good light
i
need to know that this park be safe

i will tell you something that trouble i
from the start
the carnivore be all
wellfed and keep separated from they
natural prey
Thatll keep they alive
but it will not keep they happy

how do you mean

the carnivore will want to hunt
it be
an instinct
and that instinct will have
to be satisfied or suppress

gennaro be putting negative idea into
Ellies head
he be a naysayer
i have
no affection for that type of think

do not worry
ellie make she own
judgment

hey
great day for a tour

look like rain to i

no
i told the raingod to hold it off
till we get back

kid mind mr
regis
he be in charge now

gennaro for once in you life let
something really move you

ever get the feel we be just hammonds
damn guinea pig

i like to wait and see

welcome to jurassic park
you be now
enter the lose world of the
prehistoric past a world of mighty
creature long go from the face of the
earth which you be privilege to see
for the first time

that be richard kiley
we spare no
expense

we will begin we tour today with the
herbivore

and the grass be a species of
juniper and sample can be purchased at
the gift shop
now if everyone will
take a look to the right

look

i do not see anything
do you see
anything
there be nothing there

something out there

ellie
can you imagine the excavation
team seeing this

congratulations
you be the first kid in
the whole wide world ever to see real
dinosaur
kid look up at regis with wonder in they eye

alan
alan
he fainted

i god we be going to make a fortune
here

he fainted
i have wait fifteen year to
impress that young man

oh mr
hammond i be sorry to interrupt
you but muldoon need you by the pit

oh ball

Gallimimus known as the ostrich
dinosaur for the shape of it shoulder
have a very strong nest instinct

ellie
what the hell be we going to do
with the rest of we live

what to you mean

can not you see it ellie
we be the one
that be extinct now

lots more to see in the herbivore
section of we park
but as we come
alongside out jurassic jungle river to the
left let we try and catch a glimpse of a
very unusual and dangerous carnivore
look across the river and above

and there they be

Dilophosaurus

Dilophosaurus be one of the early
carnivore
scientist once think
they jaw muscle be too weak to kill
but now through the miracle of they
cloning we know Dilophosaurs spit venom
a poison which cause blindness and then
unconsciousness

poisonous d
issue without a lot of precedent

it be like a gila monster of a cobra
it be
a poison

Spitter

be we dreaming all this

these raptor be too damn dangerous
one
of they tunneled out this morning
he
ripped a boyo arm off before i could get
a bullet in he

bullet
muldoon no
now what
i
have five left

john they be mean as scorpion and smart
as chimp
they little finger make
they natural cagebreakers
we should
terminate the raptor program
they be
just too smart
too damn smart

oh ball
i will not terminate the raptor
just because they be behave normally
they be hunter
why can not we contain they
properly

john remember back in when we
start to build the containment device
we ordered cattle prod tasers gun
that blow out electric net
they be all
too slow for these guy
if we be going
to keep the raptor i want missile
and laserguided device

it be just a zoo muldoon
zoo
figure
out a way to contain they
and we will sit
down and have a nice long discussion about
raptor after i guest leave okay

okay
get a dozer start digging round
the pit
we be going to bury some fence
and wear you rifle when you be working

wh

they will be by the trike in a moment
trike sick again

how can you say it so matteroffactly
the trike
you casually accept it but
i never can
you know what it mean when
you say by the trike
by the
trike mean that they be out there by
the species
triceratops horridus
it
astound i every time what i have do
here
what magic what alchemy
we
turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur
i will never be complacent about that

hello john
this be the anne at the
dock
i be looking at the storm pattern
just south of we
request permission
to leave before unloading the last three
food container

do not want to be stick here if this chop
get much bad

coffee anyone

hello skipper john hammond how be you
tonight
i certainly do not want to
imperil anyone
but can you give we one
more container of food
then we will feel
comfortable be the storm delay you
return
could you help we out here
of
course if it look too choppy just go
but you would be do we a big favor

well
we will do we good sir
we will
get one more container off
how be that

i feel so sorry for she
she be so sick

we do not know what be wrong with freda
every six we

oh she will be up and around in no time
after a big night i feel the same way

poor girl
what be the matter
ellie
look at this

Microvesicles
interesting

do not she have a mommy and a daddy

we make these dinosaur in the lab
sweetheart
but they do form attachment
freda have a little one that follow she
around think Fredas he mom

what do sh

animal this size take in a minimum of
six hundred pound of plant a day
we
truck in hay and meadow grass seven
time a day
that be all she touch

west indian lilac

Thesed give anybody a stomachache

i be telling you the animal do not eat
do not eat that stuff

dr
grant sir
how about these
there

hey ellie take a look at his
good
work timmy

extremely smooth
purple stain could
be those lilac berry

i do not get it

look like you trike swallow stone to
help she digest she food
walk
around she crush berry against the
stone
and even just a little crush
berry be eventually enough

so she poison herself periodically

bet we test she saliva for any trace of

but with th
and probably bypass any mucosal
contact
straight to the stomach
i
would test she excrement

yo yuk

hey regis where be you rain god
it be going to pour
let we finish we tour

i be staying

soil sample

you read i mind
i think she be sick then they be saying
she skin be dry and flaky
and she gum
be pale
i be going to talk to dr
wu

good idea
i will keep i eye open

jim what the hello with you
i know
a storm coming i can not
it be all so
tightly planned
that be not enough
ok twenty minute i will be there
damn

the mighty TRex arise late in dinosaur
history
dinosaur rule the earth for a
hundred and twenty million year but
there be tyrannosaurs for only the last
fifteen million year of that period

you know dr
grant hammond like to
come here in the evening and just sit

where be the

good question

maybe she be down hunt apatosaurs

would if she could believe i
some
time she stand by the lagoon and stare
at those animal and wiggle those
little forearm of hers in frustration
but the TRex territory be completely
enclosed with trench and fence
believe i she can not go anywhere

then where be she

just checking in
everything ok

look at they
lean out the window
so eager
they can not wait to see it
they have come for the danger

that be what i be afraid of

what be going to happen to the goat
be
the TRex going to come eat the goat

he be here

look like the rex will have it snack a
little later today

the sensor do not see the rex around
she usually come within five minute of
hear dinner
if she do not that
mean she be sleeping we might have
access to she at the picnic area

i do not want to see he get eat
i
like the goat

what be a carnivore get out

there would be no stopping it
huge with no
natural enemy and a suppress hunt
instinct

damn those people
they be so negative

it be natural
they can not fully
appreciate that we have engineered the
animal and the park for total safety

they comb this island like a bunch of
accountant
they do not experience the
wonder the awe of it all

you can not make people experience wonder

it be like the garden of eden out there

i have see a lot of animal attack in the
bush
it be not as gory and horrifying to
see as you would think
no pool of blood or
expose bone
there be usually little or
no evidence left behind
and if
victim
be small a predator can kill by just
shaking the little thing to death eat
it and leave not so much as a button

thank god
we have to carry he
first i have to

he be losing a lot of blood
help i

look like you have be through this
before

i told you i have see big game attack in
africa

right

why

because Nedry mess with the code
that be why i be checking it

but that could take week
what would be
fast
try keychecks

that be true
Keychecks will give i a
record of every button Nedry push

jesus that be all he do all afternoon
he be just dick around maybe waiting
to get he nerve up

what be that

some sort of object
let we see if we can
trace it

what be it mean

it be not a bug
it be a trap door that
fat bastard left for himself
when he
hit
it initiate a set of
command that turned the whole goddamn
park off
hammond be right about he

if i do that i would leave a way to turn it
back on
in case i have to
i be sure
Nedry do
you be find it

we find gennaro
he would badly injured
Hardings tending to he in you
quarter
he will be all right if we can
radio for help
you grandchildren and
grant be somewhere in the park
i
believe they be alive but i do not know
where they be

i be sure you will find they

i certainly hope so

i be sure we will
after all i keep
telling everyone this park be make for
child

just so you understand that they be
miss sir

miss
of course i know they be
miss
you just said that
look bob
let we not get carry away
we have have a
little breakdown from the storm or
whatever and as a result we have have a
regrettable unfortunate accident
and
that be all that happen
we be dealing
with it
arnold will get the computer
cleaned up and
the radio and phone line
open
you will find those kid and i good
friend dr
grant
i be sure they will want
some of this ice cream
it be very good

that rex do not even give i he full
attention
that be what hurt
i be
just an afterthought
i give he i full
attention

he be have a lot of morphine

not enough

i need to find wu
i have to run a few
test in he lab

he be probably in the control room get
ting in the way while arnold try to put
thing together

yo ho i will close this place down


i be tire

you be too big to be carry

but i be tiredtired

okay lex

oof

oh i do right there

Timmys scare of height

shut up

okay with the fence timmy

fray of height

herbivore graze area
excellent

we going to walk all night

twelve hour before that ship reach the
mainland

we need sleep

up there

climb
again
i can not climb again

sure you can

it be ok lex
Everythings going to be okay


what be taking arnold so long
this room
be too cold
i egg will be damaged

no sign of those berry
really
interesting
there be indication of a
similar virus in every tissue sample
but it be not in the ground
could i look
at some of the discard embryo

i be sure you will find you virus
or a
similar one
all animal carry many
virus
almost impossible to say with certainty
which be the same strain

and yet from what harding tell i many
of you animal have similar symptom
besides the microvesicles a lack of
hunger loss of reproductive urge sore
in the mouth and gum

what the hell do harding know
he be a
veterinarian not a pathologist

what be it

that be it

that be what

i find the command to restore the
original code
it reset the link
parameter

the fence and the power

right
and it do something else
it
erase the code line that refer to it
it
destroy all evidence it be ever there

Nedry could steal the egg get back and
reset the whole show
no one would ever
miss he

watch this

hot damn

be the fence back on

you bet they be
it will take a few
second to get up to full power because
we have get fift
and the generator have to feed the
capacitor along the way
but in a half
a minute we will be back in business

motion sensor

get they too
it will be a few minute
while the computer count
then i will
tell you where grant and the kid be and
you can go and get they
but every
thing work
half past ten and we have
get the whole thing back up and running

just hiss

what be taking so damn long
where be they

there be a lot of extraneous movement out
there
branch blowing bird back
ground movement
it may take ah okay
count finished

hmmmm
i do not see they
maybe they be
out of range of a sensor

shit
i do not know where they be
i
wish i could go out there but i have not
get anything to use on the rex
i
rocket launcher in the jeep Nedry
steal
and going out with a big gun in
the dark would be suicide

why do not you get some sleep dr
wu
i be just going to run a couple more test
and then i be going to turn in myself

no point in everyone be exhausted

i be sure muldoon will find dr
grant as
soon as there be light


press tightly into grant

he going to eat we

i do not think so
she be a

herbivore

come here baby
get you b

like the trike
maybe it be not the stone
muldoon slam

where the hell be they going

let we see what be up

tim i think there be a motion sensor
across the field and down there

where be lex

mere boy mere

glad you be awake
i hope
you be not going to take this little

park
it would be terrible if the
finishing fund be in any way held up

you really should not have get out of
the vehicle
the park be actually quite

you will have to bear with he mr
hammond
he be dope to infinity and back

who give you permission

i be here to investigate this park
and
there be
plenty you have not tell i

that be absurd

these bone be not fully form

you be qualify to interpret xray of
live dinosaur
i doubt it
it take
i many month to learn

i will tell you something else freda be not
an adult just a huge juvenile

you be making a lot of assumption here

right
what the hell be going on wu

growth hormone

she do not have a right to explore i lab

let we not argue wu we have a serious
problem
to
these animal do not last
there be a
regularity a predictability about when
they die
it be always
very young
we do not know why
give time i be sure
wu will figure it out
it be just

just some adjustment in the code be
required

but there be deadline
the park open
next summer
and it require fullgrown
specimen
so wu use growth hormone to
achieve the desire size in a short
amount of time
but they all keep die
and we do not know how to stop it

i be going to tell you all this myself
dr
Sattler after gennaro stopped
breathing down i neck
that be why i
wanted you and dr
grant
island you have to help i keep the
dinosaur alive
will not you please help

Gennaros losing a lot of blood

need transfusion
we get to get a
rescue helicopter
arnold what be with
the phone

ah hell
i just can not find it

find what

Nedry jam all the communication line
he insert some command a lockout into
the program code
i can not find it
because i give that restore command and
it erased part of the program listing

so
just reset shut the system down
and you will clear the memory
everything
will be in the normal wakeup mode

shut the system down

and reset

i have never do that before
and i be
reluctant to do it
maybe it be tr
system will come on but maybe they will not

look there be a sick man here who need
medical attention or he will die
four
people be out there missing in you
park
we need search team
we have to
have a phone or radio

well

well it be just that the safety system
do not function with the computer shut
down and

turn the goddamn safety system off
can not you get it through you head that
we have no choice

okay
he pop they

you ask for it
and you get it

let we go
kid

tell he fix i park fix i park

you shut down as six thirtyfour this
morning and when you start back up it
be with auxiliary power

jesus
the auxiliary generator fire up
first and then that be used to start the
main generator because it need a heavy
charge
the main generator have to be
manually reset

outside
in
the generator build

this do not mean the fence have be
off since sixthirty do it

backup power do not generate enough
amperage to power the electrify fence
so they be automatically keep off
that be also why we have no phone or
radio

all of the fence

yes

including the velociraptor mesh

yes yes yes

do you mean those raptor

i be afraid so

no no way
last time it take they two
day to chew through that mesh
but give
they enough time they will get out
we
well get that power on now

regardless check the pit
make sure
there five of they there

what be that steam coming out of i
generator room

relax it be just refrigerated air
there be a leaky cool pipe
i fixed it
a couple time before but the original
installation be at too sharp an angle

just go and turn on you generator then
get right back to the control room

raptor chewed they way out
all five

we have to leave now

oh you do not know
there be wonderful
plan in the works site already
purchased for EuroJurassic and jurassic
japan

do not you see i have exalt human
potential here
you must see it
you
must feel it
i called back a life form
listen dr
grant do not go
be a part
of this
i be invite you to do just
that let the other go if they want

you interrupted natural law
there be
regulation
rule that nature follow
that make she knowable

you mean there be rule that nature
follow that create barrier to we
knowledge

barrier
like the season
the earth
spinning orbit the sun
the entire
solar system in interlock motion
we
own being in biological step with it
all
mr
hammond you have disrupted the
pattern and look what it be do

i know what it be do
i have make
triceratop and gallimimus and a TRex
i have get a batch of iguanadons be born
on tuesday
what do you say to that

do not count on it
now get in

you created mutant form that you **further/far
mutate to create amus
you make biological puppet with
heartbeat and an early death sentence

i created genetic miracle

you created a park to generate a profit
making merchandise operation

the merchandise be just a byproduct
souvenir for people to reflect on the
wonder
you fainted when you see the
brachiosaur
alan look let we not
argue
the problem be that i employee
be not up to par with i dream
they
failed i
the park i promise you be
safe
it really be

you park be doomed
now come with i

it be not
it be blooming
in the throe
of labor
you be one more more negative
voice in a
you will amount to nothing
you will be a
bonebrusher all you life
i pity you

come back mr
hammond
it be over

they be so beautiful
they be condemned
be not they
even those embryo fragment
have the same viral contamination

i have a theory

you have a theory

i think that they could never completely
isolate the dinosaur
there be
always some microscopic mosquito
contamination
but at the molecular
level that be enough
every dinosaur
received the same genetic massage the
encode that every mosquito get to
terminate life after a season

so the very process itself be flawed
