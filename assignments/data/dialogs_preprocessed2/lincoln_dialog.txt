now that white people have
accustom themselves to seeing
negro man with gun fighting on
they behalf and now that they can
tolerate negro soldier get the

it be nighttime
the ship moved
by some terrible power at a
terrific speed




though it be imperceptible in the
darkness i have an intuition that
we be headed towards a shore
no
one else seem to be aboard the
vessel
i be alone

i could be bound in a nutshell
and count myself a king of infinite
space
be it not that i have bad
dream
i reckon it be the speed that be
strange to i
i be used to going a
deliberate pace

i should spare you
i should not
tell you i dream

i do not want to be spare if you
be not
and you spare i nothing

perhaps perhaps it be the assault on
wilmington port
you dream about
the ship before a battle usually


rap lightly on his


how be the coconut

beyond description

almost two year nothing mend
another casualty of the war
who
want to listen to a useless woman
grouse about she carriage accident

i do

stuff
you tell i dream that be
all i be you soothsayer that be
all i be anymore i be not to be
trusted with even if it be not a
carriage accident even if it be
an attempt assassination

it be most probably an

it be an assassin
whose intended
target be you

how be the plan for the big shindy
progress

i do not want to talk about party
you do not care about party

not much but they be a necessary

i know
i know what it be about
the ship it be not wilmington port
it be not a military campaign
it be
the amendment to abolish slavery
why else would you force i to

invite demented radical into i
home

you be going to try to get the
amendment passed in the house of
representative before the term
end before the inauguration



do not spend too much money on the
flubdubs

no one loved as much as you no
one ever be loved so much by
the people you might do anything
now
do not do not waste that power
on an amendment bill that be sure of
defeat

do you remember roberts coming
home for the reception

i know you would forget

that be the ship you be sailing on
the thirteenth amendment
you
need not tell i i be right
i know i
am


it be late mrs
Keckley

holding out the bodice

she need this for the grand
reception

it be slow work

good night

concern a little


do you tell she a dream




papa

hmm

papa i want to see willie



i too Taddie
but we can not

why not

willy go
three year now
he be go


the part assign to i be to raise
the flag which if there be no
fault in the machinery i will do
and when up it will be for the
people to keep it up

that be i speech

we be coming father Abraam
three hundred thousand more
from Mississippis wind stream
and from new englands shore

we leave we plow and workshop
we wife and child dear
with heart too full for utterance
with but a silent tear
we be coming father Abraam


even if every republican in the
house vote yes far from
guaranteed since when have we
party unanimously supported
anything
but say all we fellow
republican vote for it
we would still
be twenty vote short

only twenty


only twenty

we can find twenty vote

twenty house democrat who will vote
to abolish slavery
in i opinion

to which i always listen

or pretend to

with all three of i ear

we will win the war soon it be
inevitable be not it

be not win yit

you will begin you second term with
semidivine stature
imagine the
possibility peace will bring
why tarnish you invaluable luster
with a battle in the house
it be a
rat nest in there the same gang
of talentless hick and hack that
rejected the amendment ten month
back
we will lose

i like we chance now

consider the obstacle that we would
face
the aforementioned twothirds
majority needed to pass an
amendment
we have a republican

majority but barely more than
fifty percent

Fiftysix

we need democratic support
there be
none to be have

since the house last vote on the
amendment there be be an election
Sixtyfour democrat lost they
house seat in november
that be
sixtyfour democrat looking for
work come march

about reelection they can
vote however it suit em


i said nothing of buying anything
we need twenty vote be all i
said
start of i second term
plenty of position to fill

mr
president may i present mr
and mrs
jolly who have come from
missouri to


from jeff city president


mr
jolly
madam
this by the
fire secretary of state seward

jeff city

i hear tell once of a jefferson
city lawyer who have a parrot that would
wake he each morning crying out
today be the day the world shall
end as scripture have foretold

and one day the lawyer shoot he for
the sake of peace and quiet i
presume thus fulfilling for the
bird at least it prophecy


launching into his


they only one tollbooth in jeff
city t the southwest n this man
heinz Sauermagen from rolla be in
illegal possession for near two
yar since you man general
schofield set he up there
but
president monroe give that tollgate
to i granpap and quincy adams give
i pap a letter saying it be we
for keep
mrs
jolly get the
to he wife

show mr
lincoln the quincy adams
letter

that be unnecessary mrs
jolly
just tell i what you want from
i



mr
Jollys emphysema do not care
for cigar

madame
do you know about the
proposed thirteenth amendment to
the constitution


yes sir everybody know of it
the
president favor it

do you


we do

you know that it abolish slavery


yes sir
i know it

and be that why you favor it


what i favor ending the war
Oncet we do away with slavery the
rebs quit fighting since
slaveries what they be fighting
for
mr
lincoln you always say
so
with the amendment slaveries
end and they will give up
the war
can finish then

if the war finished first before
we end slavery would


president lincoln say the war
will not stop unless we finish slavery

but if it do
the south be
exhaust
if they run out of
bullet and man would you still

want you uh who be you
representative

jeff city
that be uh congressman
burton


beanpole burton i mean josiah
burton yes sir

to mrs
jolly

republican
undecided on the
question of the amendment i
believe
perhaps you could call on
he and inform he of you
enthusiasm


yeah

madam
if the rebel surrender next
week would you at the end of this
month want congressman burton to
vote for the thirteenth amendment


if that be how it be no more war
and all i reckon mr
Jollyd much
prefer not to have congress pass
the amendment


and why be that


in a hoarse voice

nigger


if he do not have to let some
alabama coon come up to missouri
steal he chicken and he job
he would much prefer that


to lincoln quietly

the people
i begin to see why you be in such a
great hurry to put it through

to mr
jolly

would you let i study this letter
sir about the tollbooth
come back
to i in the morning and we will
consider what the law say

and be sure to visit beanpole and
tell he that you support passage
of the amendment
as a military
necessity

to the Jollys

moment

if procure vote with offer of
employment be what you intend i will
fetch a friend from albany who can

they will vote for this rash and
dangerous amendment only if every

we republican be not

night back

this be an official war department
map


and the entire cabinet waiting to
hear what it portend

bombardment
from the large
fleet the navy have ever assembled



old neptune
shake thou hoary lock

Fiftyeight ship be underway of
every tonnage and fire range

we will keep up a steady barrage
we
first target be fort fisher
it
defend wilmington port

steady barrage

hundred shell a minute

till they surrender

dear god

yes
yes

Wilmingtons they last open
seaport
therefore

wilmington fall richmond fall
after


and the war
be do

then why if i may ask be we not
concentrate the nation
attention on wilmington
why
instead be we reading in the

he smack a newspaper on

that the antislavery amendment
be be precipitate onto the
house floor for debate because
you eagerness in what seem an
unwarranted intrusion of the
executive into legislative
prerogative be compelling it to
it be
to what be likely to be it
premature demise
you signed the
emancipation proclamation you have
do all that can be expected

the emancipation proclamation
merely a war measure
after the war
the court make a meal of it

when edward bates be attorney
general he feel confident in it
enough to allow you to sign



different lawyer different
opinion
it free slave as a
military exigent not in any other

i do not recall bates be any too
certain about the legality of i
proclamation just it be not
downright criminal
somewheres in
between
back when i ride the legal
circuit in illinois i defend a
woman from Metamora named melissa
going year old they said she
murdered she husband
he be
he
be choking she
and uh she
grab ahold of a stick of fire

wood and fractured he skull n he
die
in he will he write i
expect she have killed i
if i get
over it i will have revenge


no one be keen to see she
convicted he be that kind of
husband
i ask the prosecute
attorney if i might have a short
conference with i client
and she
and i go into a room in the
courthouse but i alone emerge
the window in the room be find to
be wide open
it be believe the
old lady may have climb out of
it
i told the bailiff right before
i left she in the room she ask i
where she could get a good drink of
water and i told she tennessee
mrs
going be see no more in
Metamora
enough justice have be
do
they even forgive the
bondsman she bail

i be afraid i do not

i decided that the constitution
give i war power but no one
know just exactly what those
power be
some say they do not
exist
i do not know
i decided i
needed they to exist to uphold i
oath to protect the constitution
which i decided mean that i could
take the rebel slave from em as
property confiscate in war
that
might recommend to suspicion that i
agree with the rebs that they
slave be property in the first
place
of course i do not never
have i be glad to see any man free
and if calling a man property or
war contraband do the trick
why i caught at the opportunity
now here where it get truly
slippery
i use the law allow
for the seizure of property in a
war knowing it apply only to the
property of government and

citizen of belligerent nation
but the south be not a nation
that be why i can not negotiate with
they
so if in fact the negroe be
property accord to law have i
the right to take the rebel
property from em if i insist
they be rebel only and not
citizen of a belligerent country
and slipperier still
i maintain it
be not we actual southern state in
rebellion but only the rebel
living in those state the law of
which state remain in force
the
law of which state remain in
force
that mean that since it be
state law that determine whether
negroe can be sell as slave as
property the federal government
do not have a say in that least
not yet
a glance at seward


then negroe in those state be
slave hence property hence i
war power allow i to confiscate
em as such
so i confiscate em
but if i be a respecter of state
law how then can i legally free
em with i proclamation as i
do unless i be cancel state
law
i feel the war demanded it
i oath demanded it
i feel right
with myself
and i hope it be
legal to do it i be hope still

two year ago i proclaim these
people emancipate then
thenceforward and forever free

but let we say the court decide i
have no authority to do it
they
might well decide that
say there be
no amendment abolishing slavery
say it be after the war and i can
no longer use i war power to just
ignore the court decision like
i sometimes feel i have to do
might
those people i free be ordered
back into slavery
that be why i would
like to get the thirteenth
amendment through the house and on

it way to ratification by the
state wrap the whole slavery
thing up forever and aye
as soon
as i be able
now
end of this
month
and i would like you to stand
behind i
like i cabinet most
always do

as the preacher said i could write
short sermon but once i start i
get too lazy to stop

it seem to i sir you be
describe precisely the sort of
dictator the democrat have be
howling about

dictator be not susceptible to
law

neither be he
he just said as
much
ignore the court
twisting
meaning
what rein he in from
from

well the people do that i
suppose
i signed the emancipation
proclamation a year and half before
i second election
i feel i be
within i power to do it
however i
also feel that i might be wrong
about that
i know the people would
tell i
i give em a year and half
to think about it
and they re
elected i
and come february the first i
intend to sign the thirteenth
amendment


well mr
representative ashley
tell we the news from the hill

well
ah
news

why for instance be this thus and
what be the reason for this
thusness

i

james we want you to bring the
antislavery amendment to the floor
for debate

the amendment manager be
you not

i be of course but
immediately

and we be counting on robust
radical support so tell mr
stevens we expect he to put his
back into it it be not going to be
easy but we trust

it be impossible
no i be sorry
no we can not organize anything
immediately in the house
i have
be canvassing the democrat since
the election in case any of they
softened after they get wallope
but they have stiffen if
anything mr
secretary
there
be not nearly enough vote

we be whaler mr
ashley


whaler
as in um whale

we have be chasing this whale for a
long time
we have finally place a
harpoon in the monster back
it be in james it be in
we finish
the deed now we can not wait
or
with one flop of he tail he will
smash the boat and send we all to
eternity

on the st of this month
of this
year
put the amendment up for a
vote

whaler

that be what he said

the mane never be near a whale
ship in he life


withdraw radical support force he
to abandon this scheme whatever
he be up to he drag he foot
about everything lincoln
why this
urgency
we get it through the
senate without difficulty because

we have the number
come december
you will have the same in the house
the amendment be the easy work
of ten minute

he be use the threat of the
amendment to frighten the rebel
into an immediate surrender

i imagine we would rejoice to see that

will you rejoice when the southern
state have rejoin the union
pellmell as lincoln intend they
to and one by one each refuse to
ratify the amendment
if we pass
it which we will not


why be we cooperate with with
he
we all know what he be do
and we all know what he will do
we
can not offer up abolition best
legal prayer to he game and
trick

he be say he would welcome the south
back with all it slave in chain

three year ago he said that
to
calm the border state when we be

i do not

you said we all know what he will
do
i do not know

you know he be not to be trusted

trust
i be sorry i be under the
misapprehension you choose
profession be politics
i have never
trusted the president
i never

trust anyone
but
have not he
surprise you

no mr
stevens he have not

nothing surprise you asa
therefore nothing about you be
surprise
perhaps that be why
you constituent do not reelect
you to the come term
collecting he cane and


it be late i be old i be going home

lincoln the inveterate dawdler
lincoln the southerner lincoln the
capitulate compromiser we
adversary and leader of the
godforsaken republican party we
party abraham lincoln have ask
we to work with he to accomplish
the death of slavery in america

capacity for astonishment

the president be never to be
mention
nor i
you be paid for
you discretion




hell you can have that for
nothing what we need money for be

how the people love i husband
they flock to see he by they
thousands on public day
they will
never love you the way they love
he
how difficult it must be for
you to know that
and yet how
important to remember it










ah shit on the people and what
they want and what they be ready
for
i do not give a goddamn about
the people and what they want
this

fight long and hard for the good
of the people without caring much
for any of em
and i look a lot
badly without the wig

to represent they
to
lead they
and i lead
you ought to
try it

i admire you zeal mr
stevens
and i have tried to profit from the
example of it
but if i would listen
to you i would have declared every slave
free the minute the first she will
strike fort sumter
then the border
state would have go over to the
confederacy the war would have be
lost and the union along with it
and instead of abolishing slavery
as we hope to do in two week
we would be watch helpless as
infant as it spread from the
american south into south america

oh how you have long to say that
to i
you claim you trust they
but you know what the people be
you know that the inner compass
that should direct the soul toward
justice have ossify in white man

thought of sharing this country
infinite abundance with negroe

compass i learn when i be
surveying it will it will point you
true north from where you be
standing but it be get no advice

about the swamp and desert and
chasm that you will encounter along
the way
if in pursuit of you
destination you plunge ahead
heedless of obstacle and achieve
nothing more than to sink in a
swamp what be the use of knowing
true north

evident truth that thing which be
equal to the same thing be equal
to each other

equality
that be the origin be not
it
that balance that be fairness

to promote you ultimate
and ardent dream to elevate

the true purpose of the amendment
mr
wood you perfectlynamed
brainless obstructive object


you have always insist mr
stevens that negroe be the same
as white man be

the true purpose of the amendment

i do not hold with equality in all
thing only with equality before
the law and nothing more

impermeable to reason with cold
pallid slime in they vein instead

incapable of crushing you



yet even you pendleton who should
have be gibbetted for treason
long before today even worthless
unworthy you ought to be treated
equally before the law

of view
you imagine robert will

he very natural ambition

with a mocking smile

and if i refuse to take the high
road if i will not take up the rough
old cross will you threaten i
again with the madhouse as you do

you think i be ignorant of what
you be up to because you have not

when have i

new orleans slave market
it
sickened i n more than that it
bring a shadow down a pall
around i eye
slavery trouble i as long as i
can remember in a way it never
troubled i father though he hated
it
in he own fashion
he know no
smallhold dirt farmer could
compete with slave plantation
he
take we out from kentucky to get
away from em
he wanted indiana
keep free
he be not a kind man

for fairness for freedom in he
i
learn that from he i suppose if
little else from he
we do not
care for one another mr
Yeaman

i
well i be sorry to hear that

but we be entirely unready for
emancipation
there be too many



we be unready for peace too be not
we
when it come it will present we

state resume they former position
in the union speedily enough to
enable we to block ratification of
the thirteenth amendment

i would like peace immediately

yes and

i would like you state restored to
they practical relation to the
union immediately

if this could be given i in
writing as vice president of the
confederacy i would bring that
document with celerity to jefferson
davis

surrender and we can discuss
reconstruction

surrender will not be think of
unless you have assure we in
writing that we will be readmit
in time to block this amendment





this be the arrogant demand of a
conqueror for a humiliating


you will not be conquer people mr
hunter
you will be citizen
return to the law and the
guarantee of right of the
constitution

which now extinguish slavery
and
with it we economy
all we law
will be determined by a congress of
vengeful yankee all we right
be subject to a supreme court
bench by black republican
radical
all we tradition will
be obliterate
we will not know
ourselves anymore

a nod then

we be not here to discuss
reconstruction we have no legal
basis for that discussion
but i
do not want to deal falsely
the
northern state ratify most of
em
as i figure it remains for
two of the southern state to do
the same even after all be
readmit
and i be working on
that

tennessee and louisiana

arkansas too most likely
it will be
ratify
slavery sir it be do

if we submit ourselves to law
alex even submit to losing
freedom the freedom to oppress
for instance we may discover
other freedom previously unknown
to we
have you keep faith with
democratic process as frustrate
as that can be



come sir spare we at least these
piety
do you defeat we with
ballot

Howve you held you union
together
through democracy
how
many hundreds of thousands have
die during you administration
you union sir be bond in
cannonfire and death

it may be you be right
but say all
we do be show the world that
democracy be not chaos that there
be a great invisible strength in a
people union
say we have show
that a people can endure awful
sacrifice and yet cohere
might not
that save at least the idea of
democracy to aspire to
eventually to become worthy of
at
all rate whatever may be proven
by blood and sacrifice must have be
prove by now
shall we stop this
bleed



once he surrender send he boy
back to they home they farm
they shop

yes sir as we discuss

liberality all around
no
punishment
i do not want that
and
the leader jeff and the rest of
em if they escape leave the
country while i back turned
that would not upset i none

when peace come it must not just be
hanging

by outward appearance you be ten
year old than you be a year
ago

some weariness have bit at i bone
i never see the like of it before
what i see today
never see the
like of it before

you always know that what this be
going to be
intimate and ugly
you must have needed to see it close
when you decided to come down here

we have make it possible for one
another to do terrible thing

and we have win the war
now you have
to lead we out of it




you have an itch to travel

i would like that
to the west by rail

shaking she head no

he wife out buggyriding on good
friday

jerusalem
where david and solomon
walk

ancient city

all anyone will remember of i be i
be crazy and i ruined you
happiness

anyone think that do not
understand molly


when they look at you at what it
cost to live at the heart of this
they will wonder at it
they will
wonder at you
they should
but
they should also look at the
wretched woman by you side if
they want to understand what this
be truly like
for an ordinary
person
for anyone other than you

we must try to be happy
we
must
both of we
we have be so
miserable for so long

i do say some colored man the
intelligent the educated and
veteran i qualified it

mr
stevens be furious he want to
know why you qualified it

no one hear the intelligent or the
educated part
all they hear be
the first time any president have
ever make mention of negro voting

still i wish i would mention it in a
good speech

mr
stevens also want to know why
you do not make a good speech




mrs
lincolns waiting in the
carriage

you of the hour and that you will
have to pick up miss harris and
major rathbone

no sir

thank you mr
slade

i suppose it be time to go though i
would rather stay





the president have be shoot

the president have be shoot at
fords theater



it be
in the morning saturday
the th of april
it be all over
the president be no more

now he belong to the age



fondly do we hope fervently do we
pray that this mighty scourge of
war may speedily pass away

yet if god will that it continue
until all the wealth pile by the
bondman two hundred and fifty
year of unrequited toil shall be
sunk and until every drop of blood
draw with the lash shall be paid
by another draw with the sword as
be say three thousand year ago
so still it must be say the
judgment of the lord be true and
righteous altogether



with malice toward none with
charity for all with firmness in
the right as god give we to see
the right let we strive on to
finish the work we be in to bind
up the nation wound to care for
he who shall have borne the
battle and for he widow and he
orphan to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and a last
peace among ourselves and with all
nation
