but if we hesitate we will lose
this important source of dilithium
trade agreement be in the good
interest of the empire

praetor i recommend we dispatch a
diplomatic mission to Celes to
open negotiation

senator TalAura you disagree with
the motion

no sir
i would say negotiation
be to be advise
i support all
diplomatic overture
but if you
will excuse i praetor i have an
appointment with the Tholian
ambassador

then i will call for a vote on the
motion to open trade negotiation
with Celes

would someone please tell i what
that be
alert security

and have they run a

duty

starship captain life be filled
with solemn duty
i have command
man in battle
i have negotiated
peace treaty between implacable
enemy
i have represent the
federation in first contact with
twentyseven alien species
but
none of this compare to i solemn
duty as
good man

now i know that on an occasion
such as this
it be expected that i
be gracious and fulsome with praise
on the wonder of this blessed
union
but have you two
considered what you be do to
this be all a damn
inconvenience
while you be happily settling in on
the titan i will have to train a new
first officer
no doubt a stern
martinet who will quote the rule book
at i and never
ever
allow i
to go on away mission
then there be the matter of i
new counselor
undoubtedly some
softspoken willowy thing who will
be probing into i dark psyche
as she nod she head and coo
sympathetically
be not that right
deanna

i notice dr
crusher laughing along
with the rest of you
as most of
you know the doctor will also soon
be leaving the enterprise to
assume command of starfleet
medical
again i be forced to ask
beverly have you considered what
you be do to little oleo i
i will probably get some old battle
axe of a doctor who will tell i to
eat i vegetable and put i on
report if i do not show up for i
physical on time

it will serve you right

really it be not too late to
reconsider
no
very well then

will Riker you have be i
trust right arm for fourteen
year
you have helped keep i
course true and steady
deanna
troi you have be i conscience
and best guide the touchstone to
the good part of myself
you
be i family
and in proper
maritime tradition i wish you full
sail and a clear horizon
i
friend make it so

sort of like losing a son and
gain an empath be not it

please beverly this be hard
enough

if you start tearing up i promise
to beam you out
level one medical
emergency
there be no crying in
starfleet

i have never see you captain so
nostalgic
maybe he be get soft
in he old age

not likely
after we install the
new series four replicator he
tried to order he usual tea and
there be a glitch
have we remove
the whole bunch of they and put the
old one back in

there
nostalgic about old
replicator

he just like thing the way he
like they
of course so do i

romulan ale should be illegal

it be old chum

then it should be more illegal

really captain it be a lovely
toast

the least i could do for you
deanna
besides you know i
i be a talk head

and you need not worry
i will brief
you new counselor on everything
she need to know

the hell you will
you know too
much about i as it be
now you
promised there be no speech
during the ceremony on Betazed

no no speech
no clothes
either

lady and gentleman and invited
tran gender species
in i
study of terran and Betazoid
conjugal rite i have discover it
be traditional to present the
happy couple with a gift
given
commander Rikers affection for
archaic musical form i have
elected to present the follow as
i gift in honor of they
conjugation

if you please mister band leader
aone and atwo and

blue sky smile at i nothing
but blue sky do i see
blue
bird singing a song nothing but
blue bird all day long
never see
the sun shining so bright never
see thing going so right


Ugghhh
irving berlin

all right go ahead

may i have this dance

with pleasure captain

commander Worf
do klingon
swing

i be not a swinger
i be unwell

do not worry i be a doctor

i be so glad you make it back to the
enterprise before i left

i be not suited for the life of
a
diplomat

Whod have guess

i have be saving this
chateau
picard
batten down the
hatch

they say a vintner history be in
every glass
the soil he come
from
he past as well as he
hope for the future

so
to happy ending

to happy ending

sir
i notice an interesting
confluence of emotion at the
wedding
i be familiar with the
human concept of tear through
laughter and it inverse laughter
through tear but i could not help
wonder about the human capacity
for express both pleasure and
sadness simultaneously

i understand why it would seem
confuse
certain human ritual
like wedding birthday or
funeral evoke strong and very
complex emotion
these rite
carry great weight with we because
they denote the passage of time

and you be particularly aware of
this feel because commander
Riker will be leaving to assume
command of the titan

will and deanna joining the titan
dr
crusher going to starfleet
medical

and this make you sad

well
i suppose it do a bit
i be very happy for they of course
but i be going to miss they
the
ship will seem
incomplete
without they

that be because you have a
familiarity with they
you can
predict specific reaction and
behavior and be comfortable in
that knowledge

yes
and frankly i envy they as
well
they have make important
choice
they be going to have
great challenge ahead of they
new world to conquer

see will and deanna today make
i think about some of the choice
i have make in i own life
devote
myself to starfleet
not marry
or have child
all the
choice that lead i here

the choice i make have lead i here
as well
this be the only home i
have ever known
i cannot foresee
a reason for leaving

you never know what be over the
horizon data
before too long
you will be offered a command of you
own
data look at he
he have
never really considered this

if i be
i believe i memory
engrams would sense the absence of
you specific reaction and
behavior
i would miss you


now you make a toast

to new world

new world
yes data brave new
world

the fleet commander be nervous
they have agreed to remain at they
give coordinate and await his
order
but they be anxious to
know what be going on here

i do not blame they
we can not keep
they in the dark forever



but in darkness there be strength

do not you agree



consider it the great symbol of
the empire
but the birdofprey
hold planet
romulus remus
they destiny conjoin

yet for generation one of those
planet have be without a voice
we will be silent no longer

join we commander
now what be
the disposition of the fleet

they be holding position

and

they will obey praetor

it be imperative we retain they
allegiance or we great mission
will be strangled before it can
truly draw breath

they support you intention sir
but they require evidence of
you
sincerity

and they will have it
he begin to pace over
the star chart
tell the fleet that the day of
negotiation and diplomacy be over
the almighty federation will fall
before we
as i promised you

the time we have dream of be at
hand
the time
of conquest

cut off the dragon head and it
cannot strike back

how many warbird will you need

none

praetor
you have the whole fleet
at you disposal
they supported
the coup they will follow you

the scimitar will serve i need

but surely

i come this far alone
he look at he Reman
warrior
we come this far alone
we require
no assistance from the fleet
now
leave i to i thought

be we prepare

yes praetor

so many year for this moment
he look up at his
viceroy smile
bring he to i

i will not do it

it be tradition Worf
you of all
people should appreciate that
besides i have already see it

warrior do not appear without
he clthe
it leaf he
vulnerable

i do not think we be going to see
much combat on Betazed

do not be too sure
mother will be
there

i will not do it

will not do what mister Worf

captain
i think it be
inappropriate for a starfleet
officer to appear
naked

come now a big strapping fellow
like you
what be you afraid of

i be picking up an unusual
electromagnetic signature from the
Kolarin system

what sort of signature

Positronic

it be very faint but i have isolated
it to the third planet in the
Kolarin system

what do we know about the planet

uncharted
we will have to get
closer for a more detail scan

theory

since positronic signature have
only be known to emanate from
android such as myself it be
logical to theorize that there be
an android such as myself on
Kolarus

how many of you do dr
soong make

i think only i myself and lore

diverting to the Kolarin system
take we awfully close to the
romulan neutral zone

still well on we side

i think it be worth a look
do not
worry number one we will get you to
Betazed with time to spare

thank you sir

where we will all honor the
Betazoid tradition
no cold foot
or any other part of we anatomy
now if you will excuse i
i will be
in the gym

mister branson set course for the
Kolarin system
warp five
deanna shoot he a
glance
warp seven

plot and laid in sir

engage

you well believe you be engaged

what do you think data a long
lose relative

i read six distinct positronic
signature spread out over a few
kilometer on the surface

what do we know about the
population

isolated pocket of humanoid
it
appear to be a prewarp
civilization at an early stage of
industrial development

captain i do not recommend
transport that ion storm
do not look very neighborly
it
could head this way without much
warn

understand
data Worf you be
with i

captain i hope i do not have to
remind you

i appreciate you concern number
one but i have be itch to try
out the argo

sir

captain prerogative will
there be no foreseeable danger
and you wife would never forgive
i if anything happen to you

you have the bridge mister troi

the close signature be two
kilometer to the west
that
direction sir

thank you data
let we see what she can do

i will always be baffled by the
human predilection for pilote
vehicle at unsafe velocity

monitor with
tricorder
over that rise sir
half a
kilometer

it appear to be
he scan with his
tricorder
an arm

why be it moving

like i it have be design with
modular power source

mister Worf if you please

the next signature be one kilometer
to the south

the final signature be
approximately meter up that
incline

mister Worf accompany data please

to find the head sir

if you do not mind

ten meter

i think it unlikely you will need
you phaser to recover the cranial
unit
of course it could bite
you

it be you

the resemblance be
strike

why be i looking at i

you be not looking at yourself
you be looking at i

you do not look like i

no

i would like to pick you up now
may i do that

you have a pretty shirt

thank you

fascinating

i have two arm and ten finger
do you know where i arm be
i
cannot see where we be going
where be we going
etc
like Threepio in
empire when he be
strapped to Chewbaccas
back


commander



if you would not mind

thank you

you have a shiny head

he be very observant

i can see that

captain

shall we try some unsafe
velocity


you have a red shirt

this be not an appropriate time for
a conversation

why

because the captain have to
concentrate on pilote the
vehicle

why

data

sorry sir

mister data
let we make like the
wind

he must have klingon blood

i think you have nice eye

we eye be identical doctor

Geordi

at work analyze the
torso section
well he seem to have the same
internal mechanic as data but not
as much positronic development
the neural pathway be not nearly
as sophisticated
i would say he be a
prototype
something dr
soong
created before data

do you have a name sir

i be the

benign
dr
Soongs penchant for
whimsical name seem to have no
end

you have a fuzzy face

trying to ignore the
head
keep i informed number one and
please put he back together

can you tell i how you come to be
on the planet where we find you

i be taken from i homeworld by
people called the PakJeds
they
be fat
they trade i to a ship
belonging to the Bolians
the
Bolians be blue
they put i in
a seat and ask i question
then they be attack by another
ship

then people called the
Delviciansans picked i up
they
have long tooth
they ask if i
do anything to help they
i told
they i could do whatever they
wanted
they ask i to clean out
the matrix manifold
i told they
i do not know what an matrix
manifold look like

excuse i
i have some diagnostics
to run on some medical scanner
thing

and after they show i the
engine manifold
then they
show i something called a
plasma mop

then the Cardassians put i
into something called a garbage
chute and i go out into space
again



Worf to commander Riker
i have
the tactical manifest ready sir

quickly tapping he comm
badge
Worf
wonderful
i will be right
there
duty call gentleman
carry on

fuzzy face be go

yes please continue

i be in space for a long time
then a ship belonging to the
Talosians picked i up
they
ask i where i come from
i told
they people called the Pakleds
take i from i homeworld
they
be fat

then i opened i eye and see you

do you know who i be

you be i

no
i name be data
i be you
brother

and after the ceremony on
Betazed three entire week for we
honeymoon

we be going sail on the opal
sea
we have booked an oldfashion
solar catamaran
just we and the
sun and the wave

it seem a very
soft honeymoon

it be mean to be relax

klingon honeymoon begin with the
Kholamar desert march where the
couple bond in endurance trial
if they survive the challenge they
move on to the fire cave of
Feklhr to face the demon of
thor

well that sound relaxing too

it be
invigorating

so they have get he up and running

he be a very unusual android

run in the family

earl grey hot

come
Counselor

do you have a moment sir

of course sit down

it be about data i have watch he
with the and i be trouble
Datas desire for a family be
very strong
i be afraid he may be
investing too much in the

you be speaking of emotional
investment

the be like a slow child sir
and data in he own way have
assumed the position of a parent or
guardian
i be afraid he have
expectation base on he own
experience
he will be disappoint
when the cannot meet those
expectation

as much as we care for he
deanna
we have to remember that
data be not capable of
disappointment

i do not believe that sir
we have
shared many disappoint journey

i be going to miss you

and i you



captain you have an alpha priority
communication from starfleet
command

acknowledge
i will talk to data

thank you sir

admiral janeway
good to see you

jeans luc
how do you like a trip
to romulus
all expense paid

with or without the rest of the
fleet

diplomatic mission
we have be
invited believe it or not
seem
there be be some kind of internal
political shakeup
the new
praetor someone called Shinzon
have requested a federation envoy

new praetor

there be more
as always
he be
Reman
believe i we do not understand it
either
you be the close ship so
i want you to high tail it over
there and hear what he have to say
get the lay of the land if the
empire become unstable it could
mean trouble for the entire
quadrant

understand

we be sending you all the
intelligence we have but it be not
much
i do not need to tell you to
watch you back jeans luc

not with the romulan

the Sona the borg the romulan
the evil Soran and that pesky
nexus
you seem to get all the
easy assignment

just lucky admiral

let we hope that luck hold
janeway out

lay in a new course
take we to
romulus
warp eight

aye aye sir
course plot and
laid in

romulus

i be afraid the opal sea will have
to wait number one
engage

as you can see the habitable half
of remus be always in darkness
because like mercury one side
always face the sun
due to the
extreme temperature on that half
of they world the Remans live on
the dark side of the planet

almost nothing be known about the
Reman homeworld although
intelligence scan have proven the
existence of dilithium mining and
heavy weapon construction

the Remans themselves be
considered an undesirable caste in
the hierarchy of the empire

but they also have the reputation
of be formidable warrior
in
the dominion war Reman force be
used as assault troop in the most
violent encounter

cannon fodder

then how do a Reman get to be
praetor
i do not get it

we have to assume he have romulan
collaborator

coup detat

the praetor power have always be
the romulan fleet
they must be
behind he

what have you learned about
Shinzon

starfleet intelligence be only
able to provide a partial account
of he military record
we can
infer he be relatively young and a
capable commander
he fight
seventeen major engagement in the
war
all successful
beyond that
we know nothing

well
it seem we be truly
sailing into the unknown
keep at
it
anything you can give i would
be appreciate
dismiss

at present he serve no useful
function
dr
soong created we to
become active and useful member of
society
i do not believe he would
have wanted the to live out he
life in he present state

i can not believe the captain go
along with a memory download

captain picard agree that the
be probably design with the same
selfactualization parameter as
myself
if i memory engrams be
successfully integrate into his
positronic matrix he should have
all i ability

he would have all you memory too
you feel comfortable with that

i feel nothing Geordi
it be i
belief that with i memory engrams
he will be able to function as a
more complete individual

an individual more like you you
mean

yes

maybe he be not suppose to be like
you
maybe he be suppose to be
just like he be

okay
we be do

do you know where you be

i be in a room with light

can you remember we father

no

do you know the name of the captain
of this vessel

no

be that you final answer

do you know i name

you have a soft voice

data he be assimilate a lot of
program
remember he be a
prototype a lot less sophisticated
than you be
we just do not know
if he matrix will be able to
adapt
or if he will be able to
retain anything
we should give
he some time

what purpose do this serve

it seem to be a redundant memory
port
maybe it be for provisional
memory storage in case he neural
pathway overload

dr
soong must have find it
unnecessary in late version

it be possible the extra memory port
be interfering with the engram
processing
mind if i keep he
here and run some diagnostics

no i do not mind

but i believe he will prove
incapable of performing high
function

do not give up hope data
i know
i know you be not capable of hope

i be not

no remain with commander la forge
he be going to try to make you
well



captain log
Stardate

the enterprise have arrive at
romulus and be waiting at the
designate coordinate
all we
hail have go unanswered
we have
be waiting for seventeen hour

why do not they answer we hail

it be an old psychological strategy
number one
to put he in a
position of dominance and make we
uneasy

it be work

Counselor

they be out there sir

sir i recommend we raise shield

not yet mister Worf

captain with all due respect to
diplomatic protocol the
federation council not sitting
out here we be

patience
diplomacy be a very
exact occupation
we can wait

captain

slowly rising from his
chair
i god

should i raise shield

no

captain

tactical analysis mister Worf

quickly analyze

Fiftytwo disruptor bank twenty

darkness
we be not comfortable
in the light

praetor Shinzon

captain picard
jeans luc
picard
i do not mean to stare
it be just well you can not
imagine how long i have be waiting
for this moment
i always imagined
you tall be not that odd
you may scan i without subterfuge
commander data

and you be not as we imagined you

no

you be human

commander Worf
i greet you as a valiant warrior
and as i brother

i will save i greeting for a good
brother

why have you ask for we presence
here

praetor

i have never meet a human woman

i be only half human

deanna troi of Betazed
empathic
and telepathic ability ship
counselor
all of this i know
but i do not know you be so
beautiful

you seem very familiar with we
personnel

i be commander Riker
may i touch you hair

praetor we have come to romulus on a
matter we be assure be of
great importance
if you have
anything to say to we as
representative of the federation
i suggest you do so now

on the world i come from there be no
light
no sun
beauty be not
important
i see now there be a
world elsewhere

praetor Shinzon
we be not here to
discuss you lack of a social life

yes i be sorry captain
there be so much we have to talk
about

i would be interest to know what
we be talking about

unity captain
tear down the
wall between we to recognize we
be one people
federation and
romulan
human and vulcan and
klingon and Reman
i be speaking of
the thing that make we the same
we want peace

i want to end the century of
mistrust
i want to be you ally
not you enemy
as a first step i
propose we eliminate the neutral
zone and begin a free and open
exchange of goods and idea

and the senate support you

i have dissolved the senate

right now you be think this all
sound too good to be true

yes

and you be wonder why the
scimitar be so well arm
be this
the ship of a peacemaker
or a
predator
picard be startled at
Shinzons choice of
word
but you be also think the
chance for peace be too promise
to ignore
above all you be
trying to decide if you can trust
i

yes

then perhaps the time have come to
add some illumination to we
discussion
computer raise
light four level

allow i to tell you a story that i
hope will clarify i position
when i be very young i be
stricken with an odd disease
i
developed a hypersensitivity to
sound
the slight whisper
cause i agony

no one know what to do
finally i
be taken to a doctor who have some
experience with terran illness
and i be finally diagnose with
Shalafts syndrome
do you know of
it captain

you know i do

then you know it be a very rare
syndrome
genetic
all the male
member of i family have it
eventually i be treated
now i
can hear as well as you can
captain

i can see as well as you can
i
can feel everything you feel
he stop right before
picard
in fact i feel exactly what you
feel
do not i jeans luc

do you trust i now

we need to talk just you and i

come to dinner on romulus tomorrow
just the two of we
or just the
one of we

you know i need to verify this

i know

tomorrow then captain
we have so
much to discuss

picard to enterprise
five to beam
out

there be no doubt captain
right
down to you regressive strain of
Shalafts syndrome
he be a clone

when be he
created

about twentyfive year ago
they
probably used a hair follicle or
skin cell

i think a skin cello the more
likely of the two

why

believe i number one
i be going
to find out
contact starfleet
command and inform they of the
situation
i need to know where
the hell he come from
deanna

i would say he be be trained to
resist telepathy
what i could
sense of he emotion be erratic
very hard to follow

be he sincere about wanting peace

i do not know
sir the strong sense i have be
that he be more than curious about
you
he very much want to know
you
the same way you want to know he

how could i not

captain do not assume he be anything
like you be
you should resist
the urge to think you know he

i not only know he deanna i be
he
and he be i

will you need to rest
as ship counselor i be
recommend you get i sleep

some honeymoon

we have time
come to bed

Imzadi what be i going to do with
you

Imzadi
this be so good

no

he can never know you as i know
you
he can never touch you as i
touch you

this be not real

can you feel i hand
be they
real
can you feel i lip i
loin



i be with you Imzadi

i will always be with you now
now
and forever

you sick bastard

deanna
what be with the name
calling

then i do not understand the
reason for the delay

you do not have to understand

and bringing the enterprise here
what possible purpose could that
serve

i have a purpose

then perhaps you will enlighten we

silence romulan

you must learn patience commander
do you know where i learned it
in
the dilithium mine of remus
spend eighteen hour every day
under the lash of a romulan guard
whip and you will soon understand
patience

praetor

now go
i have some personal
business

how long before he have we in the
dilithium mine

and when i be ready they be
going to replace you with i an
exact biological duplicate
put a
romulan agent at the heart of
starfleet to influence you command
structure
it be a bold plan

what happen

as happen so frequently here on
romulus a new government come to
power
they decided to abandon the
plan frankly i think they be
afraid i would be discover and it
would lead to war
they be not
ready for that

romulan ale i be surprise
i
can not stand it

you will acquire a taste for it

it be not quite the face you
remember

not quite
i envy the hairline

lifetime of violence will do
that
i nose be broken four
time
and i jaw
but so much
be the same
the eye you
recognize the eye

yes
the eye have it

we eye reflect we live do not
they
yours be so confident

how do you end up on remus

they send i there to die
how
could a mere human survive the
dilithium mine
it be
i be a slave
and a monster
the only thing the romulan guard
hated more than the Remans be i
but one man take pity on i
the
man who become i viceroy
he
taught i how to survive
and in
that dark place where there be
nothing of myself i find i Reman
brother
they show i the only
kindness i ever know

for thousands of year the romulan
senate have meet in this chamber and
dictated the fate of it sister
planet
but the time have come for
we to live as equal

you be do this to liberate the
Remans

no race should be a slave to
another

you do not trust i

i have no reason to

of course you do
if you have live
i life and experienced the
suffer of i people
you would be
sitting where i be now
at least i
hope you would

and if you have live i life you
would understand that there be a
great responsibility in
representing the federation
i
can not let i personal feeling
unduly influence i decision

all i have be i personal feeling
i be not raised with the ideal of
the federation
but i be trying to
understand they now
to live up to
they to live up to you

i want to know where i come from
the Remans give i a future
you
can tell i about i past

there be so much and so much of it
be dull

be we always explorer
PlCARD
no
i be the first picard to
leave earth
it cause quite a
stir in fact
but i have spent i
whole life

look up at the star

yes

and you dream about what be up
there
about

new world

after you praetor

age before rank jeans luc

so i be not as tall as you expect

i always hope i would hit two
meter

with a full head of hair

there be that

Shinzon
i be trying to believe
you

i know

if there be one ideal the federation
hold most dear it be that all man
all race can be united
from the
first time the vulcans come to
earth we have sought a future of
peace
nothing would make i more
proud than to take you hand in
friendship
in time
when trust
have be earned

i be honore to think i might
someday speak with such eloquence

in time jeans luc

in time

this be a mistake

he be gentl than i think
and
he have a sense of humor

do not forget we mission Shinzon
we should act
now
time be
running out

i time
i will spend it how i
choose

we will return to the scimitar
prepare yourself for the bond

sir we have have an unauthorized
access into the main computer

who be it

it be going to take some time to
find out the data stream be
rerout through substations all
over the ship

what program be access

that be what i do not get it be
mostly basic stellar cartography
star chart
communication
protocol
some uplinks from colony
tracking station
it be not even
restrict material

set up a security program to detect
any unusual data stream rerouting
if it happen again we want to be
ready

there be something else
i be
reviewing the sensor log
he refer to some
readout on he console
when the scimitar decloaked there
be a momentary spike in the
tertiary band there you be
not going to believe this but it be
Thalaron

i think Thalaron radiation
be theoretical

which be why we initial scan
do not pick it up
but he be get
it captain

as i remember Thalaron research
be banned in the federation
because of it bioqenic property

it have the ability to consume
organic material at the subatomic
level
i can not overestimate the
danger of Thalaron radiation jeans
luc
microscopic amount could
kill every live thing on this
ship in a matter of second

understand
keep on it
i need to
know what he have and how to
neutralize any threat
give i
option

doctor will you excuse we for a
moment
Geordi please come with
i

come
beverly come in

you be working late

remember he

he be a bit proud as i recall

he be a damn fool
selfish and
ambitious
very much in need of
season

he turned out all right

i so wanted to believe Shinzon
but the Thalaron radiation can not be
explain away
whatever he be
after it be not peace

be he very much like you be

yes



data to captain picard
Geordi and
i have identified the source of the
unauthorized computer access
and
i believe we have also discover
an opportunity to gain a tactical
advantage

on i way

jeans luc whatever you be
right now you be the man you have
make yourself
he be someone else

i wish i could believe that
doctor



Imzadi

you be not here

very logical deanna
but you
heart do not constrain itself to
mere logic
you heart long to discover
i
to know i
to leave all of this behind and
be with i

no

i can feel you desire deanna

i can feel you hunger to know the
Reman way
the old way

do not fear what you desire

the bond be broken

find she again

no this be wasting time

do as i tell you



praetor we have received the
transponder signal

on i way

it be accelerate
you have no
more time for game

have the doctor prepare
i will be
on the bridge

transport

welcome home
begin the download

tea hot

aside from slightly elevate
adrenalin and serotonin level
you be completely normal

can you describe it deanna

it be
a violation

Shinzons viceroy seem to have the
ability to reach into i thought
i have become a liability
i
request to be relieve of i
duty

permission deny
if you can
possibly endure any more of these
assault
i need you at i side
now more than ever i

Worf
raise shields

hello jeans luc

why be i here

i be lonely
he realize picard be
stare at the vein on
he face
perhaps i be not age as well as
you do

what be you do

i need a sample of you blood
what do you borg friend say
resistance be futile

yes
the bait you could not refuse
i learned there might be an
exist prototype from a
Cardassian historian then go to
a great deal of trouble to find it
and scatter it about on Kolarus

i know it would pique you
curiosity and conveniently make the
enterprise the close ship to
romulus when i contact starfleet

all of this so you could capture
i

do not be so vain
after we find
it we make a few modification
an extra memory port a hide
transponder
perhaps you eye
will be a bit less confident when
you learn i have gain access to
Starfleets communication
protocol
i now know the location
of you entire fleet
you may go

where

out of i sight

maybe i will train it to do little
trick for i like you robot do
or maybe i will snap it ugly head
off

what be this all about

it be about destiny picard
about
a Reman outcast who

you be not Reman

and i be not quite human
so what
be i
what do you see
he peer at picard
deeply
do you see a life you might have
lead
lose youth never to be
recapture

i see a young man trying
desperately to deny who he be

i see an old man set in he way
afraid to live without a uniform to
prop he up and a starfleet
regulation to tell he what to do
i see the man i will never be

i will not defend i life to you

i life be meaningless as long as
you be alive
what be i while you
exist
shadow
an enigma

if you issue be with i
this
have nothing to do with i ship and
nothing to do with the federation

oh but it do
we will no longer
bow like slave before anyone
not
the romulan and not you mighty
federation
we be a race breed for
war
for conquest

think about what you be do
Shinzon
be you ready to plunge
the entire quadrant into war to
satisfy you own personal demon

it amaze i how little you know
yourself

i be incapable of such an act and
so be you

i think the fact speak for
themselves
the same noble picard
blood run in we vein
have you
live i life you would be do
exactly as i be
look in the
mirror and see yourself

consider that captain
i can
think of no great torment for
you

it be a mirror for you as well

not for long captain
i be afraid you will not survive to
witness the victory of the echo
over the voice

no response to we hail

he cloak be perfect
no tachyon
emission no residual antiproton

keep at it Geordi
find a way in

will i need to talk to you

i be to take the prisoner to the
praetor

if you resist i will incapacitate
you

where be you taking he

praetor Shinzon want he on the
bridge

so human
you have meet you good
self

what be you do to counsellor
troi

i be preparing she for Shinzon
to
sooth he as she soothe you
to
stand at he side as she do at
yours

that will never happen

listen to he android
such a
small and weak creature
yet he
roar so valiantly
he raise one taloned
claw and put a sharp
fingernail on Picards
chest
it would take i but an instant to
tear that valiant heart from you
chest

Therell be another after i
and
another after that
you will find
we be a resilient species

i look forward to the sport
take he

move

be careful of overplay you
part commander

sorry sir
i think it added a
touch of reality to the
performance

i mission be a success sir
i
have discover the source of the
Thalaron radiation

good work
the download

he believe he have we
communication protocol
but they
will give he inaccurate location
for all starfleet vessel

move puny human animal

bit less florid data

aye sir
this way

this entire ship be essentially a
fly Thalaron generator
all it power relay lead to that
device

weapon

it would appear so

Geordi equip i with the
prototype for the emergency
transport unit
i recommend you
use it to return to the enterprise

it will only work for one of we

yes sir

we will find a way off together
recommendation

there be a shuttlebay meter
from we current location

where be picard

this way sir

looking at door security
panel
it seem to have an encrypted
security system

alacrity would be appreciate
commander

they be trying to override the
access code
Reman be really a
most complex language with
pictographs representing certain
verb root and

while i find that fascinating
data we really need that goddamned
door open

accord to the ship manifest
they be Scorpionclass attack
flier

trying to figure out the
control
what do you imagine this be

port thruster sir
would you
like i to drive

can you open the shuttlebay door

affirmative sir
negative sir
they have instigate security
override and erect a force field
around the external portal

well then
only one way to go

do you think this be a wise course
of action

we be about to find out
power up
disruptors and fire on i mark

ready captain

fire

Worf
lock on transporter

tractor beam
now

number one emergency warp

the enterprise be immaterial
they
will not make it back to federation
space

this have go far enough

i think we discuss patience
commander

and mine be wearing thin young
man
we supported you because you
promise action
and yet you delay
and you waste you time playing
game with picard while

commander Suran the game be
over
in two day the federation
will be cripple beyond repair
do that satisfy you

for the moment

and when i return
you and i
shall have a little talk about
showing proper respect

do anyone in this room harbor any
illusion about what he mean by
showing proper respect

what be happening to he face

i want opinion
he be clearly out
of he mind

but can he complete he mission

should he

be you prepare to have you hand
drenched in blood
he will show they
no mercy
and he sin will mark
we all for generation
be that
what you truly want romulan

i think you should consider that
question now or else you may
have a lifetime to think about it
in the dilithium mine

the more i studied he the more
confuse it get
finally i could
only come to one conclusion
Shinzon be created with temporal
sequence
he be design so
that at a certain point he age
process could be accelerated to
reach you age more quickly so he
could replace you

but the romulan abandoned the
plan

as a result the temporal sequence
be never activate
remember he
be suppose to replace you at
nearly you current age
he be
engineered to skip thirty year of
life
but since the sequence
be never activate he cellular
structure have start to break
down
he be die

dying

he be not design to live a
complete human life span
PlCARD
can anything be do for he

not without a complete
myelodysplastic infusion from the
only donor with compatible
but that would mean draining all
you blood

that be why he go to all that
trouble to capture you
PlCARD
how long do he have

i can not be sure but the rate of
decay seem to be accelerate

then he will come for i as a donor

brother
i cannot move

no i have only activate you
cognitive and communication
subroutine

why

because you be dangerous

why

you have be programme to gather
information that can be used
against this ship

i do not understand

i know

do you know anything about
Shinzons plan against the
federation

no

do you have any knowledge of the
tactical ability of he ship

no
can i move now

no
i must deactivate you

for how long

indefinitely

how long be that

long time brother

it be called a cascading biogenic
pulse
the unique property of
Thalaron radiation allow the energy
beam to expand almost without
limit
depend on the radiant
intensity it could encompass a
ship
or a planet

and that be exactly what he be going
to do

sir

he hatred of the federation be
apparent
he would have build a
weapon of that scope for one
reason
he be going after earth

oh boy
destroy humanity and the
federation be cripple

and the romulan invade

how can you be certain

i know how he think

and there be no way to penetrate his
cloak

no sir

he could pass within meter of
every ship in starfleet and they would
never know

but we do have one advantage
he need you blood to live
he
might come after you first

i be counting on it
we have be
ordered to head to sector
starfleet be diverting the fleet to
meet we there

strength in number

we can only hope so

he can not be allow to use that
weapon
all other concern be
secondary
do you understand i

yes sir

all hand
battle station



captain personal log
supplemental
we be heading toward
federation space at maximum warp
the crew have respond with the
dedication i have come to expect of
they
and like a thousand other
commander on a thousand other
battlefield throughout history i
wait for the dawn

to seek out new life and new
civilization
zephyr Cochrans
own word
when charles darwin set
out on the


beagle on his
journey into the unknown
he
sail without a single musket

that be another time

how far we have come
let i know if
you need anything

jeans luc
he be not you

what make we who we be doctor
can you tell i that

how long

matter of hour now

if you do not begin the procedure
soon you will never make it back to
romulus
you should not have
delayed
you should have killed
picard the moment

how long until we reach the rift

seven minute

show i we current position

how long until we reach the fleet

at we current velocity we will
arrive at sector in
approximately minute

for now we see but through a glass
darkly
he said he be a mirror

of you

yes

i do not agree
although you share
the same genetic structure the
event of you life have created
unique individual

but so much be the same
on a
biological level he be
and i
will not accept the idea that there
be nothing i can do
i have a
responsibility to try to make a
human connection with he

he would deny a human connection
be possible
he consider himself
entirely Reman

he may have already rejected i
humanity but you also have a twin

no sir it be not possible
the
be physically identical to i
although he neural pathway be
not as advance
but even if they
be he would not be i

how can you be sure

i aspire sir
to be good than i
am
the do not
nor do
Shinzon

we will never know what Shinzon might
have be
have he stand where i
do as a child
and look up at
the star

we be passing through the Bassen
rift
the projection will return
when we have clear it

it be interfering with we uplink
from starfleet cartography

yes sir
the rift effect all
longrange communication

commander Riker evasive maneuver

i do not want the enterprise
destroyed

can you learn to see in the dark
captain

report

he be firing through he cloak
we
can not get a lock

he disable we warp drive with his
first shot
we have only get

long range communication be
impossible as long as we be in the
rift

Worf prepare a full phaser spread

PlCARD
agreed

sir we be be hail

on screen

captain picard will you join i in
you ready room

you can not trace i holographic
emitter captain
so do not
bother
and you can not contact
starfleet
we be quite alone

we be

it be just the two of we now jeans
luc as it should be
you ship
and mine
you and i

why be you here

to accept you surrender
i can
clearly destroy you at any time
lower you shield and allow i to
transport you to i ship

and what of the enterprise

i have little interest in you
quaint vessel captain
if the
enterprise will withdraw to a
distance of one hundred light
year it will not be harm
