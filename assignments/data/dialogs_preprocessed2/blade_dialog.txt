guttertongue have you no respect

blood offer we an alternative
enough talk
it be time we stepped out
of the shadow

you be out of line frost

be i
or be i just the first to say
out loud what we have all be
think

the shadow suit we frost
we have
exist this way for thousands of
year

way

someone who be sick of living off
scrap
the come age belong to we

homunculus here

you be looking at a prime
specimen of the homine nocturna

if blade have not bring you here you
would have wind up like he

why do you help i

stupidity

maybe not
i do some checking she be
a hematologist
knowledge like that
might come in handy

it be not worth the risk
we can not
trust she

why

because you be tainted
the venom
still inside you
you could still
turn on we

what happen then

then i have to take you out just
like any other bloodsucker

we hunt they moving from one city to
the next tracking they migration
they be hard to kill
they tend to
regenerate

so what do you use then
stake

some of the old wife tale be true
they be severely allergic to
silver various type of wood
feed
they garlic and they will go into
anaphylactic shock

and of course there be always
sunlight ultraviolet ray

and you honestly expect i to believe
all this

i do not care what you believe
i
saved you life once i do not plan on
making a habit of it
you want i
advice you will be out of the city by
nightfall

tried to keep it from spill over
onto the street
sometimes people like yourself get
catch in the crossfire

i can go to the police
i have blood
sample back at the hospital
i can
show they

do it
you will be dead before you can
file the complaint

that be ridiculous
no one that
powerful

you be talking about a brotherhood
that predate the catholic church by
thousands of year
they survival
depend on they ability to blend in
chance be you have encounter they
and not even known it
on the subway
in a bar

get in
you be leaving

wait

consider it a part gift
vampire
mace silver nitrate essence of
garlic

so that be it
you guy just patch i
up and send i on i way

there be one other thing
i would buy
yourself a gun if i be you
if you
start becoming sensitive to the
daylight if you start becoming
thirsty regardless of much you have have
to drink then i suggest you take
that gun and use it on yourself
well that than the alternative

Halfhuman
halfvampire

what take you so long

do not even start old man

why do not you tell i the truth
about he

we be not sure we could trust you

blades mother be attack by a
vampire while she be pregnant
ultimately she die but she unborn
child live
unfortunately he would
undergo certain genetic change
while in the womb

i find blade when he be thirteen
he would be living on the street
feeding off the homeless
apparently
the thirst manifest itself at
puberty
i take he for one of they at first
almost killed he too
but then i
realized what he be

he take i fuck hand
again

you seem to be in the habit of losing
they fairly often quinn
maybe the
amputee lifestyle just suit you

we need to find he tonight

down boy
blade not going anywhere
i promise
right now though we have
more press business
it be time Dragonetti paid the piper

blade unique you know
one in a
billion anomaly
he can withstand
sunlight garlic even silver
but he
still have the thirst

what happen if he do not take the
serum

the thirst overcome he just like
the other
it be not something he can
control
the problem be time running out
he body starting to reject the
serum
and so far all i effort to
find a cure have end in failure

no offense whistler but you be not
exactly working with state of the art
equipment here
you might have missed
something

which be why you be here
we could use
someone with you experience

this used to be mine you know
it be
be passed down through the
century from one hunter to the
next

why do you hunt they

habit mostly just like this

i have a family once a wife three
daughter
then a drifter named deacon
frost come calling one evening

he killed they

eventually
he toy with they first
he make i choose do you understand
which order they would die in

how do you escape

i do not
he be cruel enough to let
i live
even give i a souvenir to remember
he by

and now you be use blade to exact
you revenge

frost bodycount keep rising and
i be not get any young be i

i would not go in there if i be you
it be good to leave he alone when he be
like this

i will take i chance

blade

it be dark in here

you get used to the darkness

whistler told i about you mother

i can not close i eye without hear
she scream

those be not real memory
no one have
that kind of recall

i do
i remember from day one
people
stare at i sensing i be
different
watch the fear grow in
they eye knowing in they heart i
be not human

if you be not human then why do you
bleed like we
i have see vampire blood you do not
have it running through you vein

just get out of here

blade

i said

rise and shine little wing

right on time

the other elder will never let you
get away with this

do not you see you fool
he will
betray you too
he be planning on
invoke LaMagra himself

the wheel turn old fang
guess you
just get a little too long in the
tooth

Dragonetti be right
you be fool
to trust i

go somewhere

china town
i need more serum
re
new equipment
what be all this

i make a trip to the hospital last
night borrowed some equipment

anticoagulant
we use it to treat
bloodclots sometimes
vampire blood
be thin than human though
watch
what happen when i introduce some
into a sample

can you imagine what a dash of that
would do on you sword

before you go i would like to take a
sample of you blood

you care about he do not you

we have get a good arrangement that be
all
whistler make the weapon i use

story

i mother used to say that a cold
heart be a dead heart

greet card

i would wish you luck doc but i never
put much stock in optimism

how be it going kam

re
calendar
you be a week early

i be in the neighborhood

whistler say i be building up a
resistance to it

i be afraid that might happen

maybe it be time to start exploring
other alternative

there be only one alternative to the
serum

yeah
i know

thanks kam
one other thing
have you ever hear
of a vampire called the sleeper

i find this in there archive

santeria witch

in that tent community down by the
city dump

what you be

you think the human will ever
accept a halfbreed like you
they
can not
they be afraid of you
the human fear we because we be
superior
they fear we because in
they heart they know they race have
become obsolete

look at they just an endless stream
of cattle in a mad race to the
slaughterhouse

the pause that refresh
care for some
smell good do not
it
pungent with just an
irrepressible hint of iron

pass

why do vampire need to drink
blood

they own blood can not sustain
hemoglobin

then vampirism be a genetic defect
just like Hemolytic anemia

so what about gene therapy

basically you would have to rewrite the
victim alter it so that the
will produce protein capable of
generate hemoglobin

how

with a retrovirus
it be inject into
the bone marrow cell it cause the
host to mutate
they have be
use they to treat Sicklecell
anemia

you be serious
you actually think
this could work

on i yes
on blade i be not so
sure
the problem be blade do not contract
the vampire virus from a bite like i
do
he be born with it
the irony
be i could probably cure every
vampire but he

then we be back to square one be not
we
sooner or later the thirst always
win

what happen to the power

i do not know but the backup
generator should have kick in

floodlight be down too

get it

understand this they be monster
hesitate for even a moment and you have
lost



word to live by whistler

it be be a long time have not it old
friend

be something wrong i friend

you be blind

there be other way to see
sit

perhaps you have bring i something
an offer for the orishas

hold out you hand

i do not come here to get i palm
read
i need something translate

show i

Sangre
written in blood

this be an old tongue from an old
world
it concern LaMagra

who be LaMagra

the vampire god
this speak of he
return

there will come a day walker

he blood will call the sleeper from
beyond the veil of tear


he blood

the day walker blood be a disparador
a trigger you see
for LaMagras
return
one need only consume it and
the spirit of he ancestor will
settle upon he
and the sleeper will rise from the
shadow anew cleansing the world in a
tide of blood


the blood tide

yes
the vampire apocalypse
it be
said that all who feel it taint will
succumb to the thirst

how do i stop it

the great wheel turn i friend
the
dark be rise
how would you fight a
shadow

i be tire
dawn be coming

but i just get here

you have be here long than you
think



jesus whistler what do they do to
you

frost take she

do not try to talk

listen
you have to finish i off
you do not want i coming back

no we can treat the wound

too far go you know that

whistler i can not

yes you can
now get on with it

whistler i

i know
just be quick about it will you
do
it right

hello blade
by the time you watch
this whistler will no doubt be
wing he way to heaven thank to
you capable hand
if it make any
difference to you he put up quite a
fight

now i be sure you be wonder about
ms
Jansens wellbeing
she be alive
and kicking ambulatory as they
like to say in the trade
whether or
not she remains so be entirely up to
you
i will make this as easy as possible for
you blade
you can find we at the
Edgewood towers
we will be waiting with
baited breath

well here we be doctor

why have not you killed i yet

deacon like to play with he food
before he eat it

how many of you be there

few thousand scattered about the
globe
in the past we have have to
restrict we number for fear of
discovery
that will not be necessary
after tonight

what happen then

the blood tide
we longprophesied
holy war against the human
there be a
force you see a spirit that exist
in we blood
i have discover a way to
invoke it

LaMagra

that be right
the answer be there
all along of course scribble down
in the forget language of i kind
wait for someone with the patience
to decipher they
i elder be foolish enough to
dismiss they as wife tale
but i
know well
imagine i surprise when blade turned
out to be the key which would set that
force free

LaMagra be not a physical being
he be a
spirit require a flesh and blood
host in order to manifest himself

you

who good to usher in the blood tide

there be no need for any of this
you
condition can be treated
whistler and
i be working on a cure when

what make you think we want to be
cured
blood be only part of the
equation
the hunt the kill
that be what the thirst be really
about

but you use blood bank

only as a last resort
preserved blood
be inferior
there be no flavor left to
it no life
fortunately i have find a way around
that particular obstacle

under these condition i can keep a
donor alive for year producing
anywhere from fifty to a hundred pint
of blood
of course this be just a pilot
program really
once the tide come
we will need to expand production
so
many more mouth to feed

you be a monster

why
because we live at another
species expense
you people farm
cattle and veal do not they
fattening
they up with steroid
it be called
evolution doctor
survival of the
fit

race
