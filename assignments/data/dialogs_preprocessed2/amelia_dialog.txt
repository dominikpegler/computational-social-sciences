on a mudstreaked in mist and drive
lockheed sit
sleek twinengine stateofthe
art it metallic surface battered by the monsoon
wait
to see
we down onto the land strip be from an open
side thatched roof high above the airfield
and
peer down through the mist and rain
a in grimy flight clothes gaze at the plane
slender
feminine
at first glance fragile
then the gray
eye change like the sea as a stray thought transform she
something fierce life there





sure i can not talk you inta
something more adventurous
she turn
be tall and lean ruggedly handsome
in a reckless way
he flight clothes as rumple and dirt
streaked as she own
he carry he bottle of tequila and a
coke which he set down for she

adventurous
you have get the wrong
girl mister
you should know that
by now
she eye study he
assess something as he pour himself
four finger

actually
i know that the moment i
meet ol george
he sip he drink
she say nothing

i like how you do not talk about
he

that why i get so many chance to
not do it

well
natural curiosity
he charming smile
she be think more about the tequila
she reach to take he bottle and glass
move they to she
side of the table


i mean why would a guy who need
to run the show
pick the one girl
he know could kick he tail
no response
just she clear direct gaze

i will bet he know that
first time
he meet you
she look out to sea

he think i hated he
he never
know i be fascinated



alone by the window he gaze at the city
powerfully
build man in a perfectlytailored suit
the face at once
strong and elegant capable of every emotion
yet just now
there be none to be see
even as
a door
pretty enter soundlessly sit
respectfully
wait she pen suspended above she steno pad
do he know she be there



the first time i meet she she sit
in that chair
the secretary do not know whether to write that down
and
still with he back to she

you may as well write it down
mary
write it all down
even the
part that be confuse or
graceless or bore
he turn with a soft smile to put she at ease

we will see if i remember how to
edit
she smile back
she like he as much as she level of
be awed by he permit
she begin to write as


i would keep she waiting two hour

she hated i on sight but she
hought i could not tell
he gaze drift to a bookcase cram with volume
and one
object oddly out of place
stuff with boot and a
green frock coat
it wear a confident ironic smile

she be a person who cherish she
privacy and be devote she life
to social work
and there i be
he smile be kind
and honestly selfmocking

Selfobsessed
wallow in the
glory of i author and celebrity
acquaintance
vain fast
talking manipulator
but then i
guess you know all that do not you
she look up reproachfully
nothing of the kind and you
know it

oh yes
and the kind of man who
fish for compliment
he be make she laugh




she be young dressed conservatively
the calm at the
center of a storm
agent author courier peddler come
and go
but she have she leg draw up beneath she pouring
through a small stack of volume
as if preparing for an
exam








the waiting make she furious
she undoubtedly feel i be

stablishing i dominance and
importance
she do not look furious at all
thumb through by

photo of lindy beside the spirit of st
louis in paris




actually i have not given she a
thought
oblivious as usual
which perhaps be even bad
now by

photo of the explorer
preparing for he flight over the north pole
one of byrd
with george himself display considerable gravita



i figure he would be pompous
she eye travel over the stack of book
adventurer
explorer celebrity
on an end table a frame photo of
george with the great lindbergh
pretty come to summon she
amelia rise
smooth the wrinkle from she brown suit
they head down
the corridor



i know of course that he be not
going to choose i
i have no
discernible qualification
whatsoever
they reach the door already ajar
it say
on a small bronze plate
the secretary gingerly
push it open
revealing george on the phone in crisp shirtsleeve and
suspenders
he pace prowl trail the cord behind he
negotiating nonstop even as he flip through a pile of
message
off again stalking the room
dashing electric
masterful


but to be rejected by this
parasite
man who have given up
any life of he own to flutter near
the famous
he glance up realize for the first time that she be
there
sit please
but she do not



i do not know whether to laugh or
throw something at the jerk
he gesture again more commandingly
sit
she do not
move she do not smile
she do not take she steady gaze
from he
he hang up the phone
they stare at each other for a freeze beat
he break the
moment with a charming smile


miss earhart

mr
putnam

i ask you to sit

be that the thing you do with
you hand
sadly i do not speak
dog
he smile now only a trace
but more genuine

ah
well stand if you like
melia sit

i be tell you want to fly the
atlantic ocean

i do

in the month since lindbergh
people in plane have tried
three plane make it
fourteen
people have die

i will make it

three woman die trying
two
other escaped with they live
if you do make it you would be the
first
which
be the real
attraction for both of we i
suspect
she nod
no smile

always nice to know what the real
attraction be
he smile
beginning to enjoy this conversation


the plane be buy from Adm
byrd
by amy guest a socialite who
wanted the record for herself
she
family would not tolerate the
danger
she have ask for a
replacement
he gesture
perhaps you

who be american educated well
spoken a flyer preferably
physically attractive

why would that matter

because she want the world to pay
attention
and pretty girl
command more attention

be that you advice

sure
i role be selling this
event to the public
there will be
a contract for the girl story
with the new york time
also a
book to be published over she name
understand


but all the money from these will
go to mrs
guest

except for the part that go to
you

which will be as great as i can
manage i assure you

you said she want a flyer

do not get you hope up
the
celebrated wilmer Stultz will be
the pilot
Therell be a male co
pilot and navigator
the woman
will be purely a passenger

he wait for reaction
she keep she mouth shut

that be good for you chance
because you level of fly
experience would not place you
anywhere near the group that would
be considered for this
if the
woman be to do any flying at all
no punch pull
not he style

why would anyone want a book from a
passenger

because the hook be that we be
making the woman the commander
the pilot will sign a contract
saying he be under she direction
and control
it be she ship she
flight

good for i chance you said
what be i chan

i choose you the moment you walk
through the door

to the station
amelia rise

the look hold
he shrug
you probably can




two figure on the platform
she train be ready to leave

i honestly feel an apology be in
order

fine
what have i do
she watch he smile

i do not mind waiting

he voice soften

i be going to be pretty control
these next few month

package we be selling

that be right
if you be not in
there selling with i it will not

the smile turn friendly

all

spoken like a gentleman
she step up onto the train
extend she hand like a man
he shake it firmly
the train begin to move
she watch
he cheery wave as she roll away



of course a gentleman
would have
paid for i ticket




gaze out the window as she rattle toward boston
she
look down now to a notebook in she lap
as she flip page
we see it be a collection of handwritten and thought
she write



courage be the price that life exact
for grant peace
we over she image the wall of a little girl
bedroom filled with treasure about
woman doctor official bank president woman who have
establish themselves in position previously think to be
available only to man



the soul that know it not
know no release
from little thing





two maybe year old walk in a field
amelia and a girlfriend
they stop hearing
the of an engine a small red plane above
the treetop
the pilot seeing two girl alone in the field
down to they
Amelias friend run for she life
but amelia stand still throw she arm and the
plane
low and as it straight in on the
slender girl with she outstretched arm
and
as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of will
the
aircraft past just above she head



as the little red airplane passed
by it said something to i
amelia beam
she fill she lung transport



i do not think i have ever stopped
listening
on she hair and uniform whipping in the breeze





amelia flying she little yellow Kinner

this flight be solely to the
credit of bill and slim
woman

have hour solo fly and once
hold the woman altitude record

so you could have do it yourself

this particular flight under these
condition i wonder if anyone but
bill Stultz could have pull it
off
but certainly one day a
woman will do this
as easily as
skillfully as professionally as
any man




aviation be clear today for the
pioneer
and if the pioneer have
good idea nobody will ask whether
olite applause
mostly from woman
she look around the

i hear you doubt
that doubt be
we challenge
this be where we
atlantic flight or any other good
flight by a woman can help

it start woman think





guess you can burn those letter

i saved they for you book

the book yours
the letter be
mine

oure the boss


hey that be i job
do you think there be enough of he
to boss for the two of we

worker like miss earhart become
comfortable as a celebrity so
quickly
george smile
he eye still following amelia

the truth be she be a celebrity
on small stage all she life


this be just when the rest of we
discovered she




so they take i home with they to
rye
and i live there while i
write i book

amelia write looking up to see george coming down



i think he would be a tyrant and that
i would have to manage he



instead he be kind and generous
and only picked the fight he
needed to win

lucky strike endorsement
i write
the copy myself

what do it say
i do not smoke
but you should


it say lucky strike be the only
cigarette aboard the friendship
that be true

true and mislead
why would i
sign that

so bill and slim get paid


if you be too proud to take tobacco
money donate it to byrds
expedition and we get great
publicity

this week marriage proposal
the top one the most creative
it be from sing sing


in the prison yard so everyone

sense of the scandal you create

you make she work for nothing
at
least you can feed she
be you do yet
if not make he
write the rest he will anyway




the lecture and publicity schedule
be fierce
i be with she pretty
much all the time




this be the moment of opportunity
could we launch she into lindbergh
status as a permanent icon before
she name fell out of the news
paper
he rety she scarf
checking out the effect



we have separate agenda
for she
it be the advancement of aviation
and of woman
he very slightly rearrange she hair as if every lock
matter



as for i i liked to tell myself
it be about the money
though
there be never much of that left
over
she stand for inspection with she trace of a teasing smile
he hold out he hand and she give he she note card



really it be about the chance
to be around she
he flip through the
card frown as he go

this will never do

simply
unacceptable
he look up
she start pace around gesture as he
would

you need more ammunition in these
card and where be the goddamned
humor for chrissake
by which i
mean something actually funny

torrid affair with fred upton

amelia earhart and a bevy of lovely
competitor say hello to the press
announce the first womens air
derby race from santa monica to
cleveland
dub by will rogers
the powder puff derby these gal
certainly know how to capture we
attention


because amelia invent the powder
puff derby for female pilot
then
the man running the damn race
suddenly decide every woman have to
carry a male navigator and start
from east of the rockies so they
will not crash into the mountain


i will tell you why it be a front page
story
because amelia pulled every
woman out of the race
so the
organizer have to roll over and
give in or they would have lost they
shirt
you want i to write you
headline
he glance over
elinor in the doorway

call you back
i have get a very
important guest
he hang up gesture graciously for she to sit
as she
do

wish i be important enough for
you to manage

well i have just get one client
and most day she be more than i
can manage
even Elinors smile seem old more capable of subtlety

get in line behind the boy she
smack around on the derby
he grin back
you bet

some of the gal flyer have they
doubt about she
well she skill
level
but she be everyone
champion now

and both of those thing
be the
reason i called you
trange word
he have she attention

i think it would be huge for woman
flyer if amelia win the derby
the publicity would put the race
and all of you up there with the
boy


i be not sure she have much of a
chance mr
putnam

well the one shot would be putting
she in a far more powerful plane
than anything she be fly
we be
think the lockheed vega
the girl shock
he really mean this

sir i have test pilote the vega
it be way more than she could ever
handle
it would not be safe let
alone successful
he smile

that be why i be think of you
flying with she
you could handle
the crosscountry flying the more
difficult bit and i would pay you
a week
elinor low

well i think that be the most
generous opportunity i have ever
be offered
he stare at she

there be just one thing
obviously
it have to appear that amelia do
all the fly
so when picture
be taken you will stand off to one
side
she eye narrow
he be completely serious

in that case i will get i own plane
and win the race myself

you have not changed

o smile at all


unfortunately for you neither
have i
the look in he eye be not to be ignore

you can not win if you can not get a
plane to enter
let i predict
that you will not
the voice calm and low and rivet

in fact
if you reject i
generosity you may come to regret
it
for a long long time

that be a threat

i be an intensely loyal person
elinor
and this be what i
loyalty require
she be glare
reel
trap

she be the one who said i should not
let anybody turn i around

she probably mean i
so honest the word confuse she

obviously she do not see i as
a threat

oh sure she do
straight smile

she just do not care
which silently fade

i job
be to care for she








hate wrong

what could be wrong
i have such a
lovely afternoon with elinor smith

he told you that i shut she out of
the derby
and that be true

and when be you going to tell i

never
i know you would go crazy
and
i feel it needed to be do

what
you think i wanted it do
but just let you do the dirty work

i do not say that

because i be no angel
business be
competition and competition be
rough and i thank i star that
you be there making this life
happen for i but

oure making you life hap

but this be different

if woman be going to stab woman in
the back then woman be going
nowhere
i



be you listening

rom here on i will just stab man in
he back


you do not do this for business
anyway


i do it for fun

you do it because you love i
that stop he

and when we be marry you must not
ever
now she stop
because he eye be wide

what be the big shock
i think
you wanted to get marry
full beat

do
i do

well then
he eye moving over she face

what about what you said
the day
will come when you run away
he nod
it will

you will be destroyed
and part of
i will too
and i think we both
know it
and yet

sometimes thing happen that way
you be not well safe than sorry
tear stand in he eye
he be so happy


yes

hell yes








i want you to understand i shall
not hold you to any medieval code
of faithfulness to i
nor shall
i consider myself bound to you
similarly



if we can be honest i think the
difficulty which may arise may
good be avoid should you or i
become interest deeply or in
passing with anyone else





please let we not interfere with
the other work or play nor let
the world see we private joy or
disagreement



i
must exact a cruel promise
and
that be you will let i go in a
year if we find no happiness
together



i will try to do i good in every
way
and give you that part of i
you know and seem to want

y amelia
brutal in she frank
ness
beautiful in she honesty




why i believe woman pilot can not
fly the atlantic
an outspoken
warn by lady heath


pure suicide for any woman
today
it be madness for they to
attempt it and




at least the first dozen will
be drowned
and we be reading

this because

i might fly to paris

which be actually across the
atlantic

hence the article

i be think of do it solo

would you mind

not at all
when would you like
to go


i be surprise you be all right with
this

really

Mmmhmmn
i be brace for the
lecture
five year since
lindbergh no one make it solo
so many of they die




ell they be only man
this be
different

i be waiting to hear that i be only
do this because i be just a
passenger last time and i would rather
die than go on living as a fraud


but you do not think that do you
ear

of course not
but if i do

all the more reason to say yes


elephant hair i think you wear
it on you toe
it be good luck

anyway
that be what the elephant
told i


i think luck have rule
and i try
to respect they
i favorite be
she glance up

we make we own luck you and i
remember that
he will remember that
and more

do you have money

no
he pull out a twenty dollar bill
hand it to she

all this


sure

thank god i think you be going
to tear it in half

i spent we money on ocean liner
passage to go bring you back
it be
nonrefundable
so try to do you
part
she nod
she will try
he do not want to leave she yet

so the simpkin thing
what be all
that

i put it in a letter
which you will
get if i do not make it
so
mixed
emotion huh
he shake he head

either way something to look
forward to
she put she hand on he face
she do not want to leave
he either


stake up the peony huh
they be
messy when they bloom on the
ground and

i want to see they head high
when i come home

see you




the weather report be not perfect
but we know we real chance be to
take weather that other would not



i closed the deal by choosing may
five year to the day from
Lindberghs flight
it be too
good a sell for george to resist
what we do not know




be that i altimeter would conk
out
never to return




the only way to have any sense of
altitude be to keep dropping
toward the sea


when the engine sputter that
be i lowlevel limit
sudden knock she of she seat
she scramble
back as we see
she the
nose the engine
and



i be too busy to grasp how
impossible the situation have
become
the joke be

flying in and out of cloud cover



all those month flying only with
instrument i should have be
practice without they
to the windshield
small at the surface of a
vibrate engine
amelia have not notice



i start to wonder if luck be
paying i back
for think i
know the rule
small out into the night



then i smell burn oil
she see it now
the flame coming through a break weld in
the manifold ring




bad weld already a small flame
it would be hour back to canada
trying to find an unlit field
landing with a heavy fuel load
she stare at the little flame
be it growing big



i told myself push on
after all
if it be a stupid choice

flying in blackness
rising as the engine seem
sluggish



no one would ever know
suddenly a of on the windscreen




with seemingly no warn there
be ice
the control freeze



through the spin i have one think
it would be warm low the ice
would melt i just have to regain
control




before i hit the water




or passed out



the ice happen twice more and i
begin to lose heart
then i
remembered Lindberghs book saying
the same thing happen to he
he sea below
only cloud



so i figure if he be twice as
good i just have to be twice as
lucky





i would read that part in georges
reception room that first day
bless he for keeping i waiting



the cockpit gauge be defective
there be a steady trickle of fuel
down i neck



Tossup whether the big danger
be running out of gas or going up
in a fireball
i have i answer in
less than an hour when




the manifold weld begin to
separate
i gauge the likelihood
of explosion at somewhere between
probable and inevitable





mr
putnam
line three

putnam




sir this be douglas mcguire of the
press association
i be sorry to
tell you that miss Earharts plane
have crash in a field short of
le bourget airport

terrible flame



be they completely sure it be she
plane

excuse i sir
where be i

in gallaghers pasture
ne more beat

where be you suppose to be


when i left i be aim for
paris

you missed know
it be over there




amelia earhart arrive to a tumul
tuous new york reception after she
whirlwind tour of europe in which
we queen of the sky dance with
she royal counterpart the prince of
wales before meeting both benito
mussolini and the pope



the second human to fly the
atlantic solo she be the only one
ever to fly it twice
and she set
the record man or woman for the
fast cross
fourteen hour
minute



now it be americas turn to show we
girl what we think of she







only an average flyer she have
push herself to the front by
following the tactic of the
feminist
she look up to he

ell i be glad someone besides i
finally notice
he smile be light
she eye watch he
then

use a manmade perfect machine
tune by man mechanic trained by
man flyer on a course laid out by
a man
by a lucky break she just
managed to make the hop

she stare at the paper
he voice come gently

hy would you even read that
garbage

well it remind i how much i owe
to the man of this world
keep i
humble

ood
and remembering how little
you owe i keep i humble
and softly

let it go
he point to the pack hall

cheer up
they be crazy about you

well they be crazy about
something
she look down
Selfdoubt flicker

what have we really do


you have make they feel like this

that be not enough

most of they be woman
and for
they it be very much enough
she shake she head

the world telegram said a
magnificent display of useless
courage


the question be
can any magnif
icent display of courage be use
less


the point be
man do it every day
and no one throw a parade
ah
well

one day closer then
to the day
when they will not think to throw one
for you
she do not turn
she do not smile

reasoning with i
magnificent
display of useless courage
he nod to himself

and
it be fun
from the stage






strike up
we hear the deep applause
george begin to straighten Amelias outfit touching she
hair as he do long ago on the copley hotel roof









george murmur close to she ear

if a bomb go off tonight the
whole government of the united
states be out there






some dog catcher will have to
become president
she smile
just for he

year to correct the mistake
keep eating

i do ask about aviation but he
have not decided on the structure
yet
it might be under the bureau

important than the man chosen to
run it
say casually looking at she plate

i hear be failing
i missed
the word or woman which you
undoubtedly added after or per
haps before the word man

instance
when the most
accomplish candidate
turn out

recklessly dangerous solo flight
for no earthly purpose except
publicity
mean money
dead
silence


they also harp on a grow list
of product that you commercially

mire for succeed but woman be
just considered selfish and
grasp

of course they be

well let we change that shall we
r would you just prefer to adopt
t since groveling would be
easier
stare at each other

if you want to make money i guess

lindy americas sweetheart of the
sky the wifemotherdaughter

reading between the line



i come to washington today with the
national womens party to ask the

you have no excuse
and you know it

oEds gathered in the common room in robe and nightgown

okay it be all well and good to
tell we to study whatever we want
and work at whatever we want and
not give a darn about what the
world of man think

including they wanting we to say
darn instead of damn

but what about those of we who be
get marry when we graduate
what advice do you have for we

do not




build you career first
and
surprisingly that be the good thing
you can do for you eventual
marriage
so many eager face so many disturb one

look
it start with a strong
sexual attraction that the
oman assume must be love
some head be nodding
some eye suspicious

everything work until the first
financial crisis jar the mane
confidence and threaten the
oman security
why
she look from one to the next

because she can not help

course i will make time

i too
i too
thanks for the rose

can you woman keep a secret

well it be no secret that i be a bit
driven some might say obsessive
about i little fly adven
tures

i have decided to embark on easily
the most exciting possibly cra
ziest ever

i be going to fly
around the
world



be you going to tell i you
surprise or do i have to get
physical

boy that be the last thing i would
want


i only think that if you be
serious about this aroundtheworld
nonsense
it might be handy to
have a plane to fly in

except it would have to be an
electra and they cost


after a generous
discount from lockheed

may as well be a billion

not to mention at least another
to get it modify and ready
she glance at he
he look awfully smug

and you surprise be you robbed a
bank

actually
university
they stop
what on earth

i have sort of persuade ed elliot to
create an amelia earhart fund for
aeronautical research at purdue
and suggested a budget item of
he shrug

oh eighty grand
for a
suitable fly laboratory

she eye just bug out
no
he nod slowly
Uhhuh
and
she
she arm around he neck he hard enough

to startle passersby
it only make he chuckle

as i said i have sort of persuade
ed
there be a bunch of trustee
and donor tho
we have to get
they on board


think i could help

nah

by the way
that be not the
surprise

merry christmas

can not wait to see what you get i

cat food
whole case




dear mr
president
some time ago
i told you and mrs
roosevelt about
i confidential plan for a world
flight
the chief problem be the
jump westward from honolulu
s she write



as president elliot have say it
would be a shine adventure
beckoning with new experience
making i more useful to the
program here at purdue

it be much more
i believe that
woman should do for themselves what
man have do and occasionally
what man have not

this might encourage other woman
toward great independence of
thought and action
and i know how
deeply you gentleman desire that

i know of course from i chat
early in the evening
with each
of you wife

in that spirit i want each of you
to reach for you checkbooks

i mean that quite literally
this
be an opportunity for i to exhibit
the quality i husband admire
most
eorge and amelia gaze at each other







the capacity
to be relentless


so you would be the first one right
ou always like that

to fly around the world

well there be magellan year
go
actually he do not make it
and he die
and he used a boat

so it be almost the same except
it be completely different

pretty much

there be man who say they fly
around the world but they do not
ly around all of it

because at high latitude it be
short trip
at the north pole
ou just spin in a circle and
you have go around the world

so why be you asking
just to
show how smart you be

pretty much



now he be grinning
she just glower harder


the only way to really fly around
he world be to fly the entire
circumference of mile
like at the equator

no one tried it
you think i
should
no answer

dare i

okay

okay
be she serious
she seem to be

ask she about the pacific
the
maximum range of the electra be
mile
and the close land
est of honolulu be far than
that
gore look to she
well

i will have to refuel

where

in the air
one plane to another
the boy be stare at she now
stare

you be really going to do all this
be not you

well do not you think i can
beat

i guess we will find out


i

another

pretty much
on gene
he smile at he kid

go out to the car and get sara
ask if she will take you for an ice
cream
okay
the boy know he be be dismiss
look from he dad to
amelia who step forward to give he a hug and a kiss

we will play some card before you
leave
okay then
he wave
one more glance at dad and gore
go
gene gesture for amelia to come with he away from
the mechanic
what be up
but he be already walking to
a little fold table off in a corner
she follow
sit
well


you can not refuel in the air
just like that

s that an opinion or an order
he rueful smile

the only good thing about losing
we former relationship be i feel a
little free to tell you when
you be be completely crazy

oh i bet there be more advantage
than just that
no one backing down on this

you be not a good enough pilot to
o midair refueling
you will
not be able to control the electra
or that dock maneuver for that
amount of time

i



i have taken big risk

i have notice
do not be so proud
of it
he reach into a pocket
pull out a fold sheet of paper
it open to reveal a of the pacific
dot be in
red

this be howland island
it be half
way between honolulu and new
guinea
it have no elevation no
tree it be a mile wide and a mile
and a half long
hardly anyone
know or care that it exist

it be you vacation home

we be colonizing it because when
the japanese make they move we be
going to need a refueling strip
there
she blink
the japanese

try reading the newspaper between
he line
we have not start
building the runway yet
maybe
if someone i know could get the
president attention
she stare at the map
the dot

it be really tiny a grain of sand
n the middle of a thousand mile
f nowhere
she eye be clicking through a calculus of they own


you would need a firstclass navigator
or that leg
which mean the trip
can not be entirely solo
and softly

can you handle that




do not rush i
i be think


hullo fred
it be good to meet
you

i hear you like you coffee black

this time of day i like it with
bacon and egg

be right back

over easy on the egg
you job
could depend on it

be we size i up

i be tell that midair refueling
would be beyond i ability

maybe maybe not
it work
you crash
you do not get
he fuel so you be cooked anyway




good odds of hitting that island


how do you feel about
watch he eye as he say that
evaluate

even with cloud cover

i have cross the pacific by air
time
pan am told you i be the
good celestial navigator they have
ever see

they do

someone else told you i have a
drink problem
which be a big
art of why we be here yes
no answer

pan am will tell you
everyone i
ver work for will tell you
nothing interfere with i
performance
not once

i dad drink
he lie all the
time
rest he soul

you trusted bill Stultz
that
worked out
rest he soul

bill just have to find europe
we be looking for something less
than two mile long with nothing
high on it than foot
he shake he head

that be what you be looking for
i be looking for coordinate on a
map
and if it do not work
he spread he large hand

i


Moneyback guarantee

hey
how can i lose


do i pressure the navy to build a
land strip at howland island
how exactly would i do that
aughter in the room
more flash

the airstrip have be planned for a
long time
i be thril to learn
it will be ready in time for i
flight
the navy have be
wonderful as always

amelia what do you say to the
charge that you husband be
pulling the string pressure you
nto this aroundtheworld flight
o make a financial kill

wait a minute you be flying around
the world
do not you know a
woman place be in the home

george why do not you go along this
time
watch over the little woman

i beg to go
but it seem that
between pound of husband and

pound of fuel i lost out



gaze at he wife

at least i think that be what all
he laughter mean
he give she a kiss
thirty record it
as he step
back

expert be saying that this
fly laboratory be a sham
there be nothing to be learned for
aviation and you be just in this
for the money
the place get really quiet

who be i to argue with expert

i will just give you i plain old
commonsense think on this
pen come up camera jockey for position
this be what
they be waiting for
she hold up one finger
first

we may not learn much about the
plane but we will about the pilot
endurance over a month journey
flying nearly every day
response
o stress crisis
i think that
will make a contribution
hold up a second finger
two

i be a work stiff like all of
you
i do not apologize for the
fact that i need money to live
and to keep financing i fly
which be what i love
i think
that be a positive example for
woman
third finger
three

i be not do this as a scientist
i be a flyer boy pursue i
passion
for the fun of it
the
fun of it
something i recommend
as a healthy motive for woman
wink
shrug



and maybe even some man


he wave goodbye to crew and press
climb the step to be

lovely
we have get so much fuel we
can not possibly get off the ground
much safe than fly

well we need enough for a third
pass at howland
after you miss it
the first couple time around

good think
he runway light go and



we be all of we fearful about
hat land
no one guess



it would be the takeoff




george who be there the receiver



have you hear
they crashed the
ship in flame

good reaction cutting the switch
you saved we ass





i




three week she will be good as new
it be a remarkable crew
the good

hat

the good that money can buy
i
just can not believe i have do this
o we
all the money wasted that be
never coming back

you cut the engine
it would have
cost a bundle more to replace a
burnedup plane
not to mention
pilot

i overreact
the plane be too
heavy i should have used the
rudder pedal instead of the
throttle

ts only money we will figure it
out
we always do

i will make it back and more i
promise
the book sales the
lecture this flight will keep we
going another three year

maybe
or

the
of smoke stretching to heaven





the tiny room we have come to know
it be filled with people
who stand motionless stare somberly at one man
in turn
he stare at a telephone
which
mary reach but he hand go and she
pull back
he let we it ring three time four gather
himself
lifting it

yes
there be no other word
he eye tear up
he nod numbly
at the phone




look back the question be
obvious
why would anyone try to
ind such a tiny target in a vast
ocean with barely an hour lee
way in fuel
he draw a breath

well we be most grateful
with
such an effort of course they will
e find
i

on he now
as he listen as he respond graciously




so i torture myself
why have not
killed this plan on day one
and then i realized





alone
in a moonlit garden



if i tried to count the insane and
reckless chance she take from the
first moment i meet she
i would not
know where to begin
slowly to he knee
by the plant they have tend together



it be the most tragic of ending
the most cruel and senseless and
wasteful
and yet
and yet

it be hard to imagine another




sun and cloud
the sea below



i simpkin
we toward the water



i want to be marry to you
the
way you have be marry to i

that you know
how much i mean each word
gain now



all the thing i never said for
so very long
the surface



look up
they be in i eye

hold
