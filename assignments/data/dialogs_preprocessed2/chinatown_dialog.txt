the problem


i husband i believe be seeing
another woman

i be afraid so

i be sorry


can not we talk about this alone mr
gittes

i be afraid not mrs
Mulwray
these
man be i operative and at some
point they be going to assist i
i
can not do everything myself


of course not

now what make you certain he be
involved with someone


wife can tell

mrs
Mulwray do you love you
husband


yes of course

then go home and forget about it


but

stare intently at
she
i be sure he love you too
you know
the expression let sleep dog
lie
you be good off not knowing


but i have to know

all right what be you husband
first name


hollis
hollis Mulwray

water and power
she handbag shoe etc


he be the chief engineer

chief engineer

this type of investigation can be
hard on you pocketbook mrs
Mulwray
it take time


money do not matter to i mr
gittes

very well
we will see what we can do


gentleman today you can walk out
that door turn right hop on a
streetcar and in twentyfive minute
end up smack in the pacific ocean
now you can swim in it you can fish
in it you can sail in it but you
can not drink it you can not water you
lawn with it you can not irrigate an
orange grove with it
remember we
live next door to the ocean but we
also live on the edge of the desert
los angeles be a desert community
beneath this build beneath every
street there be a desert
without
water the dust will rise up and cover
we as though we would never exist
pause letting the
implication sink in



the alto vallejo can save we from
that and i respectfully suggest
that eight and a half million dollar
be a fair price to pay to keep the
desert from we street and not on
top of they

mayor Bagby
let we hear from the
department again
i suppose we good
take water and power first
mr
Mulwray

in case you have forgotten gentleman
over five hundred live be lost
when the van der lip dam give way
core sample have show that beneath
this bedrock be shale similar to the
permeable shale in the van der lip
disaster
it could not withstand
that kind of pressure there
refer to a new
overleaf
now you propose yet another dirt
banked terminus dam with slope of
two and one half to one one hundred
twelve foot high and a twelve thousand
acre water surface
well it will not
hold
i will not build it
it be that
simple
i be not making that kind of
mistake twice

that be where life begin
marsh
slough tidepools
he be
fascinated by they
you know when
we first come out here he figure
that if you dump water onto desert
sand it would percolate down into
the bedrock and stay there instead
of evaporate the way it do in
most reservoir
you would lose only
twenty percent instead of seventy or
eighty
he make this city
