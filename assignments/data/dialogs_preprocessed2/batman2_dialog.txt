year old

and up
be perched at the
entrance
beneath he array jacket be a grubby sweatshirt
with the familiar yellowandblack logo
in gotham this
winter Batmania be everywhere
two hour later the snowstorm grow into a fullfledged
blizzard
the drift be two foot deep and the street be
all but empty of car
massive the size of a
panzer tank rumble past
and revealing as it pass a group of all
bundled up in muffler and parka
unbothered by the weather
they walk the street sing spreading cheer and goodwill to
the few passersby
they have just go into a lovely
rendition of silent
night when an oversize outfit with snow
chain clank slowly past in the wake of the plow
it side
be decorated with cartoon igloo advertising a popular ice
cream snack oddly inappropriate for this time
of year
streetcorner with bell and bucket at the truck
as it round a corner
the carol
then
a rock the street follow by the
sound of and a high wailing
around the corner there be on the street
the window
have blown out of Gothams lead jewelry store
gutshot
stagger and go face down in the snow as
dressed in white camouflage gear clamber out through
the shatter glass with
spill around the corner to see what be going on but a
spray of send they scatter in panic
the
truck pull even with the jewelry store and as it do
the open
slide down from the back of the
truck
the scramble aboard and mere second later
out riding atop five

appear taking the corner just a
trifle too fast on the icy street and plow
into a drift
the gun the engine but they wheel be spinning in the
snow no traction
they be about to climb out and give
chase on foot when through the windshield they see the
salvation army

the
windshield disintegrate and the sink from view as
race off to the last of the snowmobile which be already
burdened with
converge on the jewelry store but it be
difficult to carry on a highspeed pursuit when the snow a
foot deep and the good you can do be
the skid
to a halt blocked by the rumbling
by now of
course the be go scoot off on either side of
the plow sticking to the snowy sidewalk
glide across the sidewalk sending the few hardy
soul who be out on the street
couple
of be cower behind a fire hydrant trying to
avoid get run over
every time they poke they head out
another whizze past missing they by inch
the fan out in various direction
these guy be
obviously going to get away clean
the point up at the night sky where a be
blaze in the darkness

take a radio call as he streak down the
long wide avenue which border gotham park one of the few
street which be relatively clear
the at the wheel go
wideeyed and nudge he partner in disbelief
before they eye appear from the cross
street up ahead and at the entrance to gotham park
bring up the rear be

what the hell

squad car be now mass at the
entrance to the park but there be one problem
the city
snow plow do not operate on the park road and the entrance
be blocked off with reading

huge steep drift prevent they from enter and so all
they can do be stand by helplessly as the
snowmobile vanish into the tree
the race about like headless chicken trying to concoct
a plan
couple of they be trying to scale the stone wall
of the park
another be at he car bark into a radio
mike

yeah you hear i
snowmobile
so what do we do
chase they on foot
at the blare of a horn
the peer down the
long corridor of the cross street and see a
barreling toward they at with no intention of
stopping

dive leave and right
splitsecond
later
a of erupt from the
front of the jetblack supercar instantaneously
the drift that block the entrance to the park turning the
ice and snow on the path before it into water
the scream past in the wink of an eye
the
get to they foot
cold as it be they be
they mop he brow and announce dumfounded
i
that be


yank i into the near squad car and the other
follow suit

as long as the BATMOBILEs clear
a path they might as well join in the chase
both dressed in and
with visible underneath be
trudge along the path when they be by a pair of
speed
moment later they spot a on the
horizon
and they as the roar into view

thril beyond word they
slapping highfives as the car streak past
he face be weirdly illuminated by the flame still spit
from the front of the car
cool as ever approaching the
chase as a simple problem in logic he check a radar
display on he dashboard and see
the cop follow along in BATMANs path
the lead car
and plow headlong into a drift
the jam the
pedal but he rear wheel end up digging a deep rut in the
ice
he sit there curse pumping the accelerator as other
race past he on foot
the various have spread out they vehicle
over the hilly terrain of the park
he spot two of they up
ahead
as he draw closer they veer off to the
leave and right
on the front fender and rotate
into place
the Batmobile fire a pair of
which into the snow on either side and
disappear
the look back over he shoulder and see what appear
to be a plow through the snow behind he

he take evasive action but the
always seem to follow
just as he approach the crest of a
hill
the slam into the rear of the
the
force of impact knock the cleanly off
he land
in the snow beside he but the keep going
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rock
beyond with a deafen
this robber a little smart than he buddy
when he see
the shark fin on he tail he nose he snowmobile off into a

the tree be too closely space for the
torpedo to maneuver
it strike the near tree trunk and
explode harmlessly
the be feeling good about himself because the
Batmobile can not follow either
but have a plan
as
he drive alongside the grove he
passing the snowmobile on it left
attached to
a cable launch from the side of the Batmobile and
into a distant
the cable go taut and the tree directly into the
path of the second
the vehicle crash into the
trunk and the hapless go cartwheel headover
heel into a drift
in the distance appear racing to the scene on foot
ready for mopup duty
kill the flamethrower hit
the brake and do a quick on the snow
he be just spotted fresh quarry
snowmobile three and four
whizzing over a roll white pasture in the distance
we be at a makeshift where a cluster of
be burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm
they
look on in puzzlement as the two whiz past and
disappear over a crest of a hill
they bounce down the hillside and arriving at the edge
of a frozenover
with the roar of the Batmobile behind
they the two get the same idea simultaneously
smiling they rev they engine and set out over the surface
of the lake
now the Batmobile crest the ridge
the care weight tip
suddenly and it begin to skid down the hill toward the lake
see what be happening and kill the flamethrower just
in time but he can not brake the car on the snowy slope
the
prow of the Batmobile slide out onto the edge of the lake
and under it weight the begin to crack
the left
front tire take a sudden dip and badly yet the car be
sliding forward
he shift frantically from drive to reverse trying to rock
the car out of it predicament but he rear wheel find no
purchase
he can hear the ice cracking beneath he
grimace he throw a switch on the dashboard
and the trunk pop open
an industrialstrength
shoot upward and dig in at a point beyond the crest of
the hill
and a conceal begin to grind away
haul the Batmobile uphill out of danger
suspended just above the icy lake he see the
vanish into the distance
he open panel on
the dashboard
the give each other a big thumbsup
they be almost
halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile be disable
all at once they hear a strange overhead
firework
no it be a rockete past they
hitting the ice some forty foot ahead and
break free and in the frigid water
and the be skid into the drink before they
know what be hit they
the last of the robber be he big sack filled
not with toy but precious stone
he approach the edge of
the park negotiating he way through a maze of rocky
outcropping
he squirt out from behind a boulder into a
clear
and in as a erupt
behind he
the speed out from the other side of
the boulder
twist he accelerator desperately trying
to build up speed
as it be he be barely manage to stay ahead of the
flamethrower
but the jet of flame suddenly
the of
the Batmobile rise half a foot
and launch into the air
heavy be
strung between they and it land
entangle the snowmobile and stopping he in his
track
immobilize he watch through the net in horror as the
Batmobile barrel down
when the great black machine be
almost atop he
it stop on a dime six inch from he heavilypadded
frame
the be spread out near the entrance
they have rounded up
the other and return most of the loot
they hear a
dull in the distance
and a few second later the streak into view
drag the behind it he loot and he
snowmobile all tied up in one tidy parcel
at the entrance to the park the detach itself from the
Batmobile dump into the hand of the waiting
without stopping the roar out of the park and

the first car smack into a
and
the second car
and the
pigeon continue to pour down from the heaven onto

the
roof be icy and treacherous but he match she step for
step leap for leap as she vault from one build to the
next leading he on

building on the corner of the block
there be no place to go
but down

dropping he another foot or so
he manage to brace he leave foot against the wall
it be a
massive strain but he be momentarily safe if he can keep from
moving
the alternative be a twelvestory drop straight down
to the pavement
she be wrapped the handleend of the whip around an expose
pipe on the roof anchoring in place
with a cheshire
cat grin she remove the from she knapsack and hold it
on the edge of the cornice

extend toward the catwalk
and he force she to
now he have to follow
the
prospect make he nervous but it be a short hop and he

they be cautiously making they way up toward the
when appear suddenly at the far end of the

cautious step backward
he free hand close around a flick it open
they have pull almost even with the rock formation

be visible through a small gap in the rock

no sudden move
it be a long way down

across the rock
with screaming all around she take a deep breath
and toward the
she be a foot short
she grab
hold of the railing and over the trying to
pull herself up
race toward she
but the clamber down across the rocky
outcropping have managed to grab hold of he
the
have begin to swirl up toward the high recess of the
cavern and he be able to draw a clean bead on
reverberate through the cave as the first
shot strike and knock he backward

spin he around
as the third send he

scream
manage to grab the rail with one hand

down at it and two beat later
it begin to emit an
within

over to pull she up drape he cape around she
protectively
gradually as the recede to they distant
perch he stand and help to she foot
they embrace
on the edge of the abyss
