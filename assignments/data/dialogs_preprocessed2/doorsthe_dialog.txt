what be you song about mr
morrison

uh love death travel
revolt
we
all write the song we be interest
in anything about disorder chaos
especially activity which seem to
have no meaning
i think when you
make peace with authority you become
authority

can you define that a little more

yeah you can call we erotic
politician i guess


do you really consider yourself a
shaman mr
morrison


a scapegoat maybe i take on
the audience fantasy obey
they impulse
when the impulse
be destructive i be destructive
it be kinda like sucking the puss out
of a rattlesnake something like
that

like a medicine man or witch
doctor

jim said to i once the history of
rock and roll like greek drama or
caveman story
the audience come
to see ancient ritual in ancient
cave
they soul in jeopardy
they be not watch any longer
they be participating and
everything in play you life
you death

be that why they scream so much


mr
morrison how do you feel about
be called the ultimate barbie
doll

i guess when you say something like
that it be a shortcut to think

then do you think about the dreadful
review you new poetry book have
get

i guess they do not understand

and it be true you finance it be
publication

have you bothered to read the poetry
maam
you keep deny that anything
good can come from

i mean be not
that kind of a provincial attitude
that bob dylans the only poet because
he be from the east coast but you
will not even look past jims goddamn
look at the word man

hey mon ray hate should be allow

but what really be you song
about mr
morrison
you preach
saving the planet making a new
age but how do drink taking
drug this boozy sort of apocalyptic
stance at the world influence young
people in a positive way

i like that boozy apocalyptic
you be a word man but how do you
newspaper influence young people to
think about vietnam
who be sending
the soldier over there to die
the
establishment right
you newspaper
right
that seem to i a lot more
dangerous than the stuff we do


do you believe in drug mr
morrison

do you know nietzsche said all
good consciousness all evidence of
truth come only from the sense
hey you want to arm wrestle
come on
you look pretty tough today
mon
i will take you all on

and alcohol
be that consider part
of the shaman wisdom

part of the clown wisdom it be
kinda the american way
you know we
spend more on alcohol and tobacco
than on education

be you by any chance in a trance
now mr
morrison

do you hurt

what

what hurt you the most

what be you do


uh
get tire of the barbie doll
look
it hurt

be you serious

about
know when people be joking
i find they be dead serious and
when they be dead serious i find
they funny

what do you parent think about
what you be do

actually i do not really remember
be born
it musta happen during
one of i blackout

but they must have expressed some
feel

well to be honest they be not living
anymore so i do not like to talk about
that

could you at least tell we how they
die

oh it be a
horrible car crash
in the desert in the fifties
arizona
run right into a truckload
of indian
navajos they be
lying out on the road all bleed
and i be with i grandma and grandad
we be bang up and all
and i
be looking at i dad and he be
lying there
but he throat be
severed and there be air coming
out

i be sorry

i have the feel i be be put on

you all believe what you want to
believe you will anyway
but it
do kinda show you what excite
people
looking directly at
she
fear pity horror all those good
thing that count
it be sorta i guess
like be on the edge of an orgasm
know
that mystery just before
you come
