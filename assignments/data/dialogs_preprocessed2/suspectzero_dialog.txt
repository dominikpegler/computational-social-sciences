Mackelway be expressionless
but something about these
draw he close
he lean in then
we be rocket
into a series of dark disjointed image
seem like we be standing in a field of
we can not

Everythings wet windwhipped

someone just fired a gun
we slump hard to
the ground
then we look up

and ORyan begin to hurriedly
only half of he face
be visible to we but we can tell that he concentration be
total

gun Mackelway
then the pen be set down
the draw be complete
ORyan eye it calmly then check he watch jot down the
exact time and date on to the draw
then he slip it into a
folder marked


picket fence a swing on the porch a lawn that need mowing
file in each bringing food
and tissue to
cry into
shock face
food on unmatching tray

running somewhere
a rising above the wind seem to
be saying

the sound echo oddly as if bouncing off a satellite
somewhere or a distance of time and space
then the sound and the soupy grayness
this vision just
end

she know that
still she
eye she leave hand selfconsciously while Mackelway lose
himself in those lidless eye of Fulchers
then there be a
they turn
charlton stand on the other side of a
in a adjacent to this morgue

Amayzing grace how sweet the sound

in the back some of the have gathered for this

ORyan stand among they
no expression on
he face at all

threestory victorian residence in decay next door to a
in the middle of oklahoma Citys skid row
rain fall
the street be still
Mackelway approach this halfwayhouse
few light shine
within and the blue glow of a tv
upstairs can be hear the
strident offkey voice of somebody singing
the front door be open
through a Mackelway can
see an oldfashion foyer
he knock
wait
two sound dominate
the buzz from that tv and the strident
singing which we realize be an a capela version of la vida
loca audible through an open bedroom window
but no one coming to answer the door and it be wide open
anyway
so Mackelway enter

hello
room be to he left
there a single yearold
sit watch behind the
music on
tonights subject
leif garret
piper do not look up or acknowledge Mackelway at all

which seem to be intentionally offkey
torn couch stain carpet crack window
poster and
flier on the wall
upstairs



agent Mackelway
Mackelway turn
descend a creaking stairway be

lean with a friendly smile


we be stare at a that have be covered floor
to ceiling with identical rendering of that same
symbol
the
of they in bright red paint against pitch black
enamel
only a machine could have achieve this kind of
repetition
or a maniac
this basement be leaky drafty poorly lit
but it be also
quiet
the sound of that awful sing upstairs have be
by the basement door and the rain itself

benjamin spent hour down here
Mackelway take it all in every corner of this basement
he
note a row of standing

re
locker

no
they be staffonly

would you mind opening they for i
dyson shrug
he think it be a waste of time but he will do
it
Mackelway follow he across the dank room

he be here

guest to vanish for month at a time
dyson work a combination lock on the first locker

i run the name through we database just
to be sure
there be never be an agent
benjamin ORyan in the bureau

wait

Mackelway climb under the stairs crouch down pushing
aside all of the aforementioned junk
he grab the box
sure enough that bucket once hold red paint same color
ORyan used to cover that wall
there be also a bucket of
here
and some use brush
Mackelway bring the box into the meager light
we get a look
now
so do dyson
inside beneath the paintbuckets we see a few a
yoyo a football
then a on
Mackelway grab it eye it
he flip through a few page odd image
a with
eye rolling back in he head strange rite etc
Mackelway set the book down
then amidst the other material
in this box he spot a large fold
he grab it begin to unfold it
we see that this map be
written on in pen
city on it have be
but before we can get a good look at it Mackelway spot
something else at the bottom of this box a shocker

Mackelway lean in looking around

small endtable
bathroom
window without bar

from down the hall we hear the sound of a then
a transmission
an old fax machine begin to whine
noisily creaking
it be a distraction
but Mackelways focus be in this room
the wall have be newly
painted
but there be a hint of barelyperceptible color
beneath one of they
rain from a be cause some of
the new paint to peel a bit
collect drop in the center of the room
the feel
in here be damp mildewy creepy
Mackelway remains in the
doorway

it be that same
sound that ORyan make
blowing through a
ghost town
build then falling again
piper smile back away enjoy the theatricality of it
stifle a giggle
then suddenly everything turn
we have jump into a distort of this same scene
as if watch it through a crystal ball or a break lens or
a distance of time and space
we see image fragment
piper the tv the sofa Mackelways

start on ORyans
then a pad of paper
the spasm of a
pen scrawl a on to it
piper

whistling
we be
in another nondescript
a night
he hold down the point of he pen on a wavy line beside that
list of word keeping it there for a few second as if
expect to receive some kind of pulse from it
no more pulse
he have lost the connection that have somehow
transport he
he note he watch
jot down the exact time
slip the pad into that
Mackelway

of they correspond to a yellow pin on the map


why you

huh

he could be sending these to any agent in
any office in the country
but he be
sending they to you
why

i do not know

this be agent Kulok
who be calling

to Mackelway

do you know a professor named Daitz
say
he be from tulane

yeah
criminal psych
i have be trading e
mail with he

one moment please


beautiful campus quiet tonight
in it center lie a vast
expensive structure the behavioral science build
the
place go on forever
Mackelway exit an elevator on the level
corridor
octopus they way from these elevator confuse we
every door look the same
Mackelway follow the number
can not believe how long these hallway be
turn a corner
air can be hear moving through the corridor
but he have
find the right number at last
tiny fasten to a wall read dr
emile Daitz
professor emeritus criminal psychology
it also list his
office hour
Mackelway knock at a door

professor Daitz



yes
Mackelway open the door
look inside
here sit ORyan looking as much like a tweedy professor as
he can look
he rise smile warmly

agent Mackelway
come in

tiny cramp hovel
book paper and all of it jam to
overflow
Mackelway sit across from ORyan

as Daitz

the name of this theory be suspect
zero

the idea of suspect zero posit that if a
serial killer be diabolical enough he
could traverse the country without ever
be catch killing randomly


tell i what make a killer catchable

pattern repetition of behavior

now imagine a killer with no pattern no
telltale fetish no ritual no hidden
desire to be catch
perfect vessel of
evil kill without ever leaving a
single meaningful clue in he wake
he would be immune to capture would not he
you task force you forensics team
they would be helpless

be that something you believe in
professor
evil

as a citizen of the world it be hard not
to
would not you say
evil be all around we i think a part
of the natural order of thing
like
gravity
like wind
vast black wave
corrupt everything it touch
virus
invade a cell cause it to
dysfunction
perfectly logical
but do
it ever occur to you that something may
have invaded that virus something
capable of use it to mutate so
powerfully

just because something invisible to we
do not mean it do not exist

have you ever see a fiftyfoot shark


i be sorry

shark as we know will only attack
human if he run out of food
but
biologist have theorize that for a
shark of fifty foot the ocean would be an
endless buffet
he would never run out of
food so he would have no need to come to the
surface
consequently we would never see
he
do you follow
we will never see one
but that do not
mean they do not exist
hence suspect
zero

some of i colleague think i be
fascinated with evil
i think the truth
be just the opposite
evil be fascinated
with we
what good vehicle could there
be for create havoc in the world what
good instrument than man
we be vain
we be stubborn we be deceitful we have
an imagination that be limitless in it
perversion
of course evil keep trying
to harness we
would not you

excuse i

oh
i be sorry
i be looking for
professor

just like that ORyan have bolt past the coed literally
tossing she onto Mackelway explode into the hall

Mackelway sneak around the side of the house pulling on a
lever to unlatch the sidegate
he emerge into the tiny backyard making a beeline for that
storm cellar door
he know he should not be do this

tiny hallway with four door
up ahead dangle from the
ceiling be a tiny rope which promise a set of hide fold

Mackelway wait here
piper in he usual spot in front of the
dyson descend
the stairs a bit testy tonight

welcome back
that have some edge
Mackelway do not reply

Mackelway stand in the center of this room dyson in the
doorway
that down the hall be at it again offkey as
ever
tonight it be the Gilligans island themesong

i will be in i office
dyson back away leaving the door ajar
now Mackelway be alone eye the tiny bed sink window
the leaky ceiling the bucket the peel paint
this room be
heaving with energy
he sit on the bed check he watch

p
m
opposite this bed be that repainted in industrial
white with the hint of a shape underneath
it be what
Mackelways come here to investigate


ORyan sit at a desk
eye closed writing pad at he wrist
on it more of those unidentifiable line become visible to
we
they be called
he hold the point of he pen down upon one of they as if
receiving information from it and we jump back into
Mackelway
sitting
stare
outside this room we hear that
awful toneless sing as it fill the hallway
Mackelway rise approaching that repaint wall
he pull
out he key
check to see that no one watch
ORyan he pen on that pad he concentration total
we hear the sing the the rain that bucket collect
drip
semidarkness
until throw a burst of
white light against that wall
faint shape become visible just beneath the white paint
then it vanish again
use he key he begin to scratch away at the white paint
it be an irrational thing to do but in the context of the
last few day it make an odd kind of sense
instantly a hint of can be see underneath
ORyan at that desk
outside he can hear an
rumble by
he do not allow it to distract he
Mackelway scratch more of the white paint off of that wall
more appear beneath it
then a behind he
he turn
the door to this room just
someone outside must have
push it
he keep scratching at the paint
rage outside
we away from that wall
which give we the opportunity to see something that Mackelway
be too close to the wall to see for himself

there be indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white
paint
it be the shape of a vast black
handpaint
image as large as this wall itself
Mackelway seem tiny by comparison and the mere inch of black
that he have uncovered so far seem infinitesimal
in fact it almost look as if the wave be poised to swallow
he whole
and he can not even see it
but we can
must have taken ORyan day to paint something this
large
vast black wave
evil itself
and Mackelway without meaning to be about to unleash it
ORyan somehow seem to be sensing what be going on in that
room
or maybe he be just feeling the power of that wave from
memory
or maybe he be just plain crazy
but he and Mackelway on some unspoken psychic level be
feeding one another
Mackelway chip away at that white paint moving rapidly
revealing more of the blackness underneath
we on it
moving past Mackelway and he frantic scraping
then we be beneath that thin coat of white and
somehow we have submerged into the wave itself
black tidal
force of nature
and it be
alive
we hear the of it
a suck
a yawn as if a tide be draw back just before
explode forward
the sound blend in with the wind the rain the drop in that
bucket
evil itself on the move gather might
and we be
along for the ride
the wave begin to roll forward now as if shoot from a cannon
it be massive powerful dark
and we be right on it forward
edge as if surfing it somehow
ORyan react
something just changed

the wave be rush we forward with this speed and power of a
tsunami
which be when we hear the laughter of a
ORyan just hear it too
then new image come at he but
they be at first
the sound of that wave become faint recede to the
background giving way to that sound of laughter and the
squeak of a
like an old tv slowly gain reception the image take a
moment to crystallize before we
but then it sharpen
we be in the of a but it feel
like we be looking at it through a break lens
the image
appear to we surround by darkness
before we a year old play on a swing
call he
Mackelway have scrape away more of the white paint now
enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave
it lip
he continue
ORyan tighten
we can not tell if he experience something
from the past the present the future
we quickly get a look into the diner itself
there through a window we see a presumably charlies
mother
she name
kathleen have she back turned to we because she be busy
diapering she nine monthold at a table
ORyan at he desk seem to be get all of this
and it
be agitate he
there be perspiration on he forehead

the sound of that wave be still a presence
charlie look up
at we as he swing
he smile be pure genuine
we whip around for another look at kathleen
she be still busy
with that diaper
then we look back to charlie
ORyan keep he eye shut he focus total
but every part
of he be becoming tense
Mackelway be beginning to perspire from the effort
more of
that wave be visible to he
but he do not step back to take
that in
that swing be now dangle gently
and we be running
we know not where
ORyans foot start to tap
anxiousness discomfort
we run
toward a
but we do so smoothly without
effort as if be carry by that relentless black wave
then bleed in
the of the diner back
door which lead on to that play area
and we hear a horrify yell



charlie
charlie where be you honey
charlie
honey be you out here
the sound begin to break up as if on a bad radio be taken
over by the sound of that awful
Mackelway suddenly stop
as if some electric charge have
just shoot through he shortcircuiting he into stillness
he
begin to step away from the wall

ORyan have lost the pulse the connection that have allow
he inside what we just witness
he rise hurry into a tiny bathroom
we
trying to decipher these line and squiggle
the ideogram as we hear the sound of ORyan retching
Mackelway sit on the bed looking at what he be just
uncovered
an awesome sight
he head be pounding bad than
ever
so he reach for the Vicoden
we have step out of that now
kathleen grab
she infant distraught as another massive
blow by we in the distance
ORyan wash he face eye he reflection in the mirror
scrutinize himself
on the wall opposite Mackelway that huge black wave be now
entirely visible to he
bit of chipped white paint litter
the floor
vast black wave
it fill the whole wall
Mackelway eye he watch
it be one of the clock in the morning
he be be in here for four hour
that seem impossible

a box slamming down hard on a desk
we be

a
m
Mackelway be in here by himself angry
he reach
into that box
inside
more pin

he cross to
the map
he start pulling out the we have grow accustom
to seeing on this map replace they with the
tossing the discard onto the floor

as Mackelway replace pin after pin
Mackelways face as he back away from that huge map
ten minute have passed but Mackelway have see a revelation
we can read it on he face
he eye the map
which have now be stick with over
one for each city with a to it
credit
and those black pin see from a distance form a pattern we
be not expect something that never quite take shape when
the pin be yellow
look like a big black
and that be just what it be
black dot conspire to form the same exact shape that
ORyan have painted onto the wall of he room a massive wave
of darkness gather strength
but this black wave be consume america
Mackelway stare at it
awed even a bit frighten
the thing
seem vast unstoppable
black wave pure malevolence
covering the state like a fog
one blue dot lie in it center
that blue pin in the heart
of greenville texas
then piercing the silence



get one of those pin in denton yet
Mackelway turn
charlton lean in the doorway

ORyan be spotted there tonight
take a
squadcar and a sidearm from a state
trooper
bout an hour later a fiveyear
old boy be abducted roughly a mile up
the interstate
it be a
m
what be this guy do here

the vehicle be find in an abandoned
lot
we be establishing a perimeter
around the city now


but the trooper be not hurt

what make you so sure

professional courtesy

be that
possible sir
an agent can
just be delete

look like it
Mackelway pause
it be a depressing reality

i could not understand it before pushing
speck car onto the state line
make
sense now
he wanted to make the case
federal
he be draw we in

why would he do that

so we would be paying attention when he find
suspect zero

you know what
i be get extremely tire
of hearing that word
in fact that be
going to be policy from now on
no zero

sir profile the guy
he be straight outta
quantico
all he be do be working a
case like we would
he be not kidnapping
little kid he be chasing the guy who be
do the kidnap
look at the map


what be you saying that all these
abduction be the work of one guy
do
you know how fucking insane that be
not let we try something that actually
make sense
he send in these fax
pick off three scumbag
for what
so
we will think exactly what you be think
right now that we have get a friend out
there somebody will to take out the
garbage for the rest of we
and it be all
horseshit

what if it be not
what if there really be
a zero out there and ORyans the one guy
who be get a shot at he

fuck sake Mackelway when do you
start buying into this guy

he be smart than we be

speak for yourself

sir
what if i told you i know how to
catch he

do you

and what if i told you that the way i would
catch he involve sitting in a dark
room with nothing in front of i but a
pad of paper
until i would tapped into
some kind of
energy out there
the
collective unconscious
something
if i
told you i think i could target and


locate he without ever leaving this
build what would you say

i would say you would watch too many XFiles


ever hear of a project called
icarus sir

no

agent trained to see distant
location use nothing but the mind
they called it remote view

army steal it from the soviet
the
bureau steal it from the army used it
to track serial killer
experimental program
ORyan be the
first agent they recruited

good for he

voodoo right
pure bullshit
except it worked
it be how he draw
this

he would never be in that house before
he
just see what be in there the bureau
taught he how
same one that delete

same one that be trying to catch he
now
do anything about all this

machine past those lady selling ticket

rig then turn a corner and
run smack into benjamin ORyan
the shock be so total it take each of they a moment to
recover from it
but here he be

second ago he be chasing a possible zero
now he be face to
face with ORyan

together

i can not do that

then i can not help you
Mackelway disgust pull out of the lot
through sparse traffic heading for an interstate onramp

i be talking about uncompromised justice
no trial
no lawyer
no hiccup in a
chain of evidence that can set a monster
free
you of all people should be able to
appreciate the value of that

where be the boy

i will not be do this much longer
actually this be the end of it
i have


come to accept that
but there be one
last thing to

where be the boy ORyan

do we have an understand

enough of this shit
where be the boy

good
this be good
sort of thing you would
never find in a procedural manual

tell i i be right about you

i will kill you ORyan

i know
but we have work to do first

where be the goddamn kid

this be the guy who put all those pin in
that map of yours
and i can take you to
he

fine
where be he
where be he

silence punctuate by ring
then ORyan smile
and
point to he own forehead

right here
Mackelway let we out a disgust sigh

fuck you
he punch the talk button taking he eye off ORyan for a
split second
what follow be a blur
ORyan lunge forward like an animal throwing he cuff
wrist over Mackelways head yank Mackelway out of he
seat with a violent tug
the gun fall
we pulling back
obscure we view
of what be going on inside that truck
that celphone continue to ring
we keep pulling back
under this sparselytrafficked overpass rain falling
the celphone stop ringing
taking in
the expanse of highway car rolling by without a hint of the
peril beneath they

fran have just arrive
she scan the place
do not see
Mackelway
great
she reach for that celphone again

Mackelway awaken
the room feel like it be swimming
he arm
and leg be bound
he mouth have be
and he be stare into he own
he lie on he side
have be prop on the floor
just inch from he face leaving he with nothing to look
at but himself
he strain against the rope but there be no give to they
he be helpless powerless
and that mirror be forcing he to
watch it all with perfect clarity


be you afraid

quoting himself as Daitz

imagine a killer with no pattern no
telltale fetish no ritual of any
kind
no hide desire to be catch

perfect vessel of evil


and the name we give that killer
be
zero
again

be you afraid

it would be customary at this point to start
praying
i hear a lot of that
have not
see too many answer though
i would not
hold i breath waiting for another
janitor to break in here and save you
either
you be alone

where be the boy

re
the mirror
i i
must be extremely satisfy to
watch yourself say something so heroic
i be almost envious


the boyo under the bed
in piece
be
you afraid

i know what you be think
there be
pain come
be i going to take it like a
man
let i put you at ease
you will not
none of they do
man woman child
they all weep they all beg
they pass
out they piss themselves
they attempt
negotiation
you would not believe how
many man have lie right where you be
lying right now grow man with wife
and child back home offering all
kind of sexual gratification in exchange
for a five minute reprieve
it be
pathetic
be you afraid
then there be that moment when they
realize there be nothing left to be
negotiated
they be just mine
and
they be helpless
and the look in they
eye the level of surrender
well
it be almost pornographic
i put this
mirror here because i do not want you to
miss it
be you afraid

how about now

be you afraid


hmmm
agent Mackelway
be you

be you

be you afraid

open you eye
open you eye goddammit
or i will cut the fuck lid off



then
we be helpless to beat they
back
out of a soupy darkness a dreamlike spin on a location we have
visit before
it be the wheat field that ORyan have remote
view countless time
only this time we see it through
Mackelways fever or nightmare
we see the tall wheat the
wet wind familiar image to we
all to the pound chant of
the navaho
but then enter this world
they be jar
that eye rolling back foam the mouth
dancing around a fire in a frenzy
then a curtain of wheat
obscure he reveal
fran and katie giggling crook finger as if invite
we
look like they be naked
but as we approach they they
seem to get farther away
then that curtain of wheat that
separate we from they reveal
charlton extend a hand to we warmly congratulate we
for something a job well do when
Mackelway himself be hunting through the wet wheat gun draw
he
then look to see who he be just shoot
body
he turn it over
and be stare at himself lying dead on the ground in the
mud and pour rain
it be a moment of shock and horror
giving way as we
on ORyan at a desk sitting upright making note on a
pad
calm
businesslike
he back turned to we
time have passed
we do not know how much
or maybe we be dead
or dreaming
it be hard to say
but there be ORyan at a desk
write
Mackelways eye be open
he have a bright red
raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror
but the brain be functioning
it start running through a
checklist
