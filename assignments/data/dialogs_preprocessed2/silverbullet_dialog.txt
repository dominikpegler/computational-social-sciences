it be going to be the cheap funeral this

i mother and father i mother in

duty as taking marty to the funeral
of he good friend

be no mass said here this afternoon
there

of comfort to you if i could

if there be any word of comfort i can give
you it be just this
the face of the beast
always become known
the time of the beast
always pass

if there be time when we feel alone and
afraid only small creature in the dark
then these be the time when we must turn
to one another for we comfort and we hope
to we neighbor
to we community
to we
love for each other
i alone cannot ease
the pain for herb and naomi kincaid nor can
i ease you pain nor you ease mine
but if
i believe anything it be this
we can comfort
each other
we can heal each other
we can
go on together

the bible tell we not to fear the terror
that creepeth by night or that which flieth
by noonday and yet we do
we do
because
there be much we do not know and we feel
very small
but we must not be alone
we must
not allow ourselves to be alone for there be
the wide gate to the hell of terror
turn to
each other
join hand in you sorrow and try
to remember that the face of the beast always
become known
the time of the beast
always pass

i think i know

i mail another letter for marty the
next day
a third the day after that
then on saturday

we told uncle al what we would be up to
he reaction be less than serene

HolyjumpedupbaldheadedJesusCHRIST

uncle al

from he i would expect it
i sometimes think
he common sense get paralyze along with
he leg
but you jane
you
little
polly practical

you do not understand

oh i understand plenty
i understand that
i niece and nephew be sending the local
catholic priest little love note suggest
that he gargle with a break light bulb or
eat a ratpoison omelet

it come for i
i shoot it in the eye
now he be
wearing an eyepatch

i called Peltzer on i way over here
marty
father lowe come into the drugstore
two day ago for a bottle of otic solution
that be a fancy way of saying eyewash
he be
get a corneal inflammation

be it a prescription

what the hell do that matter

it be not i will bet you it be not
because
to get a prescription he would have to see a
doctor

marty marty you should hear yourself

well
be it a prescription

i do not know
but i know you do not see
any werewolf the other night marty
you
have a dream that be all
an extremely
realistic nightmare bring on by what be
be happening in this town

what about the baseball bat jane see in
he she would
you know who used to have a
baseball bat like that
mr
knopfler
he
be so proud of it he used to carry it in
the fourth of july parade
jane said it
look like the green giant used it for
a toothpick

you want to know what i think

no we just get you out here so we could
admire you pretty face

watch it dear boy
i think it be a
hallucination
probably a broomstick or
something

it be not
you want i to show you
come
on
i be not afraid
i will show you right now

no thank you jane
i be a little old for
palying the hardy boy meet the catholic
werewolf

never mind jane
he will have get rid of
it by now anyway

if father lowe be an innocent little lamb
why have not he picked up the telephone and
called constable haller to tell he Martys
sending poisonpen letter

i do not accept the idea that he know who his
letter writer be jane
because i do not accept
the idea that there be a big bad wolf who see
marty in he wheelchair

why have not he picked up the phone and told
constable haller that someone be sending
he poisonpen letter

well
he probably do
i mean he could
make a complaint without taking an ad out
in the paper could not he

i will bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff
be nonprescription
and i will bet you
another quarter he have not say anything
to mr
haller

marty do you see you suspect

yes i see he

do you really think that a man who take
a rocket in the eye three night ago
could be out mow he lawn
he would either
be in the hospital
or dead

i do not shoot he when he be a man
i shoot
he when he be

when he be a werewolf
yes
right
jesus
jane you do not really believe this madness
do you

i do not know exactly what i believe
but i
know that what i see be a baseball bat and
not a broomstick
i know there be something
strange about the way the house smell that
day
it smell like an animal den
and i
believe in marty
i mean there be time
when he make i so mad i could kill he but
i still believe in he
you used to
believe in he too uncle al

kid

little bastard

you comino down to Robertsons for a
soda marty

bastard

oh you bastard

come on baby
come on

marty

i be very sorry about this
i do not know if
you believe that or not but it be true
i
would never willingly hurt a child
you
should have left i alone marty
soft
soothing
i can not kill myself marty
you see we
religion teach that suicide be the
great sin a man or a woman can commit
stella randolph be going to commit suicide
if she have do so she would be burning in
hell right now
by killing she i take she
physical life but saved she life eternal
you see marty
you see how all thing serve
the will and the mind of god
you see you
meddling little shit

you be going to have a terrible accident
marty
you be going to fall into the river

mr
Zinneman
mr
Zinneman

i run out of gas

spooky in there ennit

it sure be


well
it be a lot easy to swallow
without the hair and the foaming jaw
also i checked on the otic solution
it be counter brand
no prescription
needed

i told you

shut up dear boy no gloat allow

do you talk to the constable

after marty called i with he late
thrilling tale of wonder i do

he be have no poisonpen complaint lodge
at all

i told you

shut up marty

there be something else


i probably should not tell you you be
both hysterical on the subject
i be
starting to feel like a guy hand
out free arthur murray coupon to
victim of the dance sickness

uncle al if you do not tell i

i go out to that rest area

you find the tracer

no
but i find some blood smeared on
a tree trunk in that grove

there
you see

it could have be anything marty

what about father lowe chasing i in his
car and trying to run i down
you do not
think that be a dream do you

no

lowes car

blue
this blue

jesus

that be just about the crazy damn story
i have ever hear al

i know
i could have edit out all of the
completely crazy stuff but i think you
deserved to hear it with the bark on

i appreciate that
now the next question
do you believe any of this
you do do not you

let we just say i believe lester lowe should
be check out

that can be arranged

mr
haller said he would check he out and
guess what
no one see he again

and what do you suggest i do about it
dear boy

i want you to turn this into a silver
bullet

you be not going to let it go be you

i see what i see

marty the moon be not even full

in the madeup story the guy who be the
werewolf only change when the moon be full
but maybe he be really that way almost all
the time only as the moon get full

the guy get wolfier

here
take mine too

jane
you do not have to do that

do not tell i what i have to do and what i
do not boogerbrains

will you marry i jane

would you kid mind telling i how this guy
lowe become a werewolf to begin with

i do not know
maybe he do not know either

no one know how cancer begin either or
exactly what it be but people still
believe in it

the kid be eleven year old and already
he sound like a jesuit
french jesuit

i think he be going to come for i
not
just because i know who he be but
because i hurt he
only i do not think
he will try again as lowe

dear boy you have go right out of
you mind

uncle als friend mac be more than a
gunsmith
he be uncle al said an
oldworld craftsman a sort of wizard
of weapon

god know what sort of story i uncle
told he but i think that for man who
have be marry as often as uncle al
invention on short notice become
something of a specialty

the gunsmith confirmed the highgrade
silver content of i crucifix and Martys
medallion

melt they down

and mold they into a silver bullet

here it be

nice piece of work i ever do i think
it be get a lowgrain load so it will not
tumble
should be pretty accurate

it be just a gag that be all
what would
you shoot a silver
bullet at anyway

how about a werewolf
