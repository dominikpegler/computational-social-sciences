well grace you see
pilgrim just
be not the same horse he used to be
as a matter of fact maybe now not
the good time to

i really want to see he

hello beautiful boy



you should have tell she annie
i
tried to explain to you how bad it be
i guess you have to see it
but there be
nothing to be do
this animal beyond
help
annie can i have you permission
now to put he down

no



it be in america that horse first
roam




million year before the birth of
man they graze the vast empty plain of
grass and crossed to other continent
over bridge of rock
they first know
man as the hunt know the hunter for
long before man see horse as a means to
killing other beast man killed they for
meat





the alliance with man would forever
be fragile for the fear he would strike
into they heart be too deep to be
dislodge
since that neolithic moment
when a horse be first halter there
be those among man who understood
this





they could see into the creature
soul and soothe the wound they find
there






for secret utter softly into
trouble ear these man be known as
the whisperer


hey darlin

hey rona
sorry i be late

i would not know what to do if you be
on time

you be looking fit

fit
you want to check i tooth
good crowd today
i think you will have
some fun
you going to stay for dinner

if it be not too much trouble i think
i might

kind of trouble i be in the mood for

Ohoh
maybe i well get back in the
truck

it be always kind of interest to
hear the horse side of the story

now if he be cranky or lazy like you
say he be we would be seeing he tail
twitch there and he ear back
maybe
but this be not a cranky horse
it be a scare horse
you see how brace
he be up around the neck back there
he just do not know which way to turn

you see how he keep pointing his
hindquarter in at i
well i would guess
the reason he seem reluctant to move
out be because when he do he get in
trouble for it

he be not good at transition you know
when i want he to move from a trot to a
lope say

well i be sure that be what you think but
that be not what i be seeing
you may think
you be asking for a lope but you body
may be saying something else altogether
you might be putting too many condition
on he
for instance you might be saying
but hey do not go too fast
he can
tell that from the way you feel
you
body can not lie
you ever give he a kick
to make he move out

he will not go unless i do

and then he go and you feel like he be
going too fast so you yank he back
and next thing you know he be bucking
well if someone told you to go stop
go stop you would buck too

it be a dance see
somebody have to lead
and somebody have to follow

i want he to get so he can leave real
soft
he be get the idea now
he be
not all brace up and tense like he be
at the start
he be finding out it be okay

you see that
he be get good
already
pretty soon if you work at
it you will be able to make all these
transition easy on a loose rein
yeah and pig fly
he be going to be okay so long as you
do not go yank on he

look the truth be it be all about self
preservation
these animal
well they just have such big heart
you know
there be nothing they want more
than to do what you want they to do
but
when the message get all confuse the
only thing they know to do be try and
save themselves
now why do not you go
saddle up and see what happen

they will not ever hold a thing against
you
they be the most forgive
creature god ever make

okay who be next

now god have another idea entirely with
the mule

excuse i

hi

get over the way he feel under i after

be going through but i be afraid you have
misunderstood whatever it be you read
i

how you feel all right about
telling liz to put he down

i think we should
it be not fair to let
he suffer
he be not much use anymore
he would hate living like that

i think that be
very compassionate
and
mature way of looking at it

mom

yeah

maybe they should put i down too

what

i mean i be not much use anymore
why
can not they be compassionate to i

how be the dinner

all we favorite people be there
saying all they favorite thing about
they favorite subject
i think to
myself we have be friend with these
people almost twenty year and nobody
know anybody

like each other and have nobody go to
dinner with

why do you go

they be still we friend annie
it be
nothing serious
you kid about they all
the time
and i could tell paul really
appreciate i be there

do you get a hold of that horse guy

about the three of we going someplace
warm
remember that house we rent in
bermuda
the pink one with the

shit

what be i saying

about we going someplace warm
someplace Gracell have to wear shorts

robert i want to take pilgrim out to mr
booker
drive he out to montana
with
grace

i do not understand
you just said he
said no

he do but
i think i can change his
mind

that be the crazy thing i ever hear
absolutely not

robert grace be not adjust to school
and she can not sit in this apartment all
day
i think it would be good for she


what be you you be serious about
this

i have called liz
they can set i up with
a trailer for pilgrim
i think we would
stay at motel along the way

you have already make arrangement

calm down

i come home and you tell i we be going
to drive a psychotic horse to montana

i will do it

you want to do this by yourself
how
you can not take care of pilgrim all the

he will be sedate
i know horse robert

what
bo

for a couple of month
i will just take
that time now
i can still oversee
thing from montana

i computer

she need
security now
stability

i can not say he be be all that effective
with she

be you a psychiatrist
he said it take
time

i do not care what he say
we have to do
something robert
i can not sit here and
trust everything going to work out just
by pretend it will

i be not pretend anything

accident i just think we

i really wish i could understand why
you think this be so necessary

robert we be losing she
we be losing
she
i do not care what the doctor say
the
truth be they do not know anymore than
we do less when it come to grace
this may not sound sensible or
logical
but nobody suggest anything well
i can not explain it robert
i just have
this feel
this annoy
bloody
feeling that if
if somehow pilgrim
can be make all right
then so can grace
i just know it

what if she do not want to go

she will if you think she should

and you think it be good if i do not come

no that be not what i said
i be not a
dictator
if you feel you should come
then come
just do whatever you think
be right

i be not going
i do not care what she
say

when i be working with a horse i like
to know it history
now most time
the horse can tell you pretty much the
whole story but sometimes he can be
so messed up in he head that you need
more to go on
you need to know exactly
what go wrong
often time it be the
obvious thing but something that go
wrong just before that maybe even some
little thing

it be like if i be driving and run into
a tree
when somebody ask i well
what happen
i do not say well
i plow into a tree
i would say the
sun be in i eye
or i skid
or
i take i mind off the road for a
second
see what i mean
i do not know how you feel about talking
about it and i can understand you might
not want to
but if i be going to figure
out what be going on in he head it would
sure help if i know exactly what
happen that day

not today whenever you feel like it
i leave it up to you

Ohoh

sense in looking for a reason why
thing happen
i used to try and
always come up
short
i do not think the why so be
important as
what we do with what
we get
i remember this boy i would see
up on the Blackfeet reservation
he
be sixteen
great kid
strong
he would
go swim and dive headfirst into
a rock
snap he neck paralyze
he
after the accident i would look
in on he from time to time
and he
be not there anymore
his mind his
spirit whatever you want to call it
it just disappeared
and what be left
be nothing but anger
it be like the
boy i know just go away somewhere

i know where he go

i know you do
do not you disappear
you do whatever you have to to hold
on
i will tell you one more thing
when
pilgrim rear up to face that
truck
you know what i think
i
think that damn horse loved you so much

what i think

take you time



play that sweet one you know
the one
make i wife here so friendly

you

day off from you work huh

i know
i could talk i way back if i wanted

to

guess you do not have to figure it out
until you go home

do you always know this be the life
you wanted

i fell in love
after that i never
think about be anything but a
rancheros wife
i never see it like i
be losing some other life just feel
like i be gain one
i know that be
not a popular opinion nowadays and i
be not saying it be the right one
we
all have to find the life mean for we

franks a good man

they do not come well
but i do not
deny there be time i wonder about
thing i will not have
maybe one day i will
get to see egypt

if you try too many different live
you can wind up with no life at all

sound like something tom would say

go looking here for whatever you looking
for
do not make that man go through

anything he do not want

he be a good man tom be
he be get a
gift come from heaven above i swear

and a woman can
lead a man into the middle of a mountain

everything right if i be the good
husband i could be the good father
even be a good lawyer only matter

if i could do all that it
would not make any difference if we

life with i anymore
