i
can not do it
do not you think i would if
i could




all rise for the honorable judge phillip
McNeily

there be an unhealthy reversal of
role here
as you can see from she drawing she
have an exaggerate sense of
responsibility
lucy feel she have to
take care of she father
although at
she birthday party she true feeling
about she father be revealed

objection
true feeling revealed

the state be paying miss geller for she
opinion

then every child who rage because they
do not get to stay up for that extra
hour of

objection you honor

in fact any child who said they hated
they parent because they do not want
to take a bath would be a prime
candidate for foster care

objection

i think they want you to stop

really
thank you sam

we all appreciate you assistance mr
dawson continue with you witness mr
turner

now ms
geller i assume in you therapy
session mr
dawson extol he
parent ability

on the contrary mr
dawson admit he
feel profoundly inadequate that he be
terrify he would make and would continue
to make and i quote
huge mistake
huge mistake mistake that be huge


no far question

you be a mother be not you ms
geller

yes

would it be fair to say that as a
parent you have feel confuse from time
to time possibly overwhelmed on
occasion even though you be a wonderful
mother

objection
it be mr
dawsons parent
not ms
Gellers that be at question
here

but if ms
geller have never have a moment
where she feel confuse as a mother it
would bias she opinion
and it be she
expert opinion we be all after be not
it mr
turner

overrule
i will allow it

thank you you honor
ms
geller i
know there have be many moment as a
parent where i have feel i have make huge
mistake mistake that be huge
and
i have have to admit they to myself
i
husband
but most importantly to i
therapist
which be the guise mr
dawson think he be seeing you under
be not that right ms
geller

objection

get to the point ms
harrison

the point be you have never have those
moment have you ms
geller
moment
that every parent i have ever spoken to
have moment when you have feel the task
be so unbelievably challenge that you
feel retard disable in some way
moment when you feel everyone have the
key but you
but you have never have those
moment have you ms
geller

i

yes or no

i

let i rephrase the question
when you
son od

objection

but if ms
geller do not feel she have
make mistake mistake that be huge
it might bias she opinion toward mr
dawson

i will

thank you
so ms
geller yes or no
when you son od do you feel you
might have make mistake mistake that
be huge

yes

you make she cry

you get lucky

that be not nice
not very nice

only in there

you just trying to

trying to what

you know trying to act like a

like a what

like a
a

real man

i do not say that

you be i lawyer and you think what they
think
i do not have a chance
no
chance at all
even with an expert
witness

i think
you deserve
a fair trial

again

objection

turners mother

real

motion to strike that from the record
irrelevant immaterial and immature

parent i be talking about the right of
a child

year old welfare in the hand of
someone whose record show he be
diagnose with infantile autism mental
retardation

sams i most reliable employee
he be
never missed a day of work in eight
year
always warm always friendly

admirable quality for a single father
mr
walker in these eight year have
mr
dawsons responsibility
which
let i see
would include
buss table replenish sweet n
low and sweeping up the place
increase

no
not really

and be not that because he be mentally
incapable of learning management skill
or working the cash register or even
making a cup of coffee

objection
leading the witness

you may answer the question

well as a matter of fact sam and i have
be discuss a promotion that i be
planning on putting into effect at the
end of the week

oh boy
thank you george

yes
thank you george
now after
eight year sam can finally measure out
a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water
now he must certainly be able to help
lucy with she geometry

objection

no far question

and when i ask another question

i answer in one sentence

yes
short and sweet

yes
one sentence
short and sweet
i aunt be short and sweet
but she
cook be too spicy she

annie
i can not believe it

tell they to take i quickly

give i one minute with the judge

besides be Lucys godmother be not
you also Lucys piano teacher

yes

Lucys very lucky
do not you graduate
magna cum laud from the Julliard school
of music

summa cum laud

excuse i
now ms
cassell in all the
time you have known they have you ever
question sams ability as a father

never

never

never
look at lucy
she be strong
she be able to display true empathy for
people all kind of people
i know you
all think she be as bright as she be
despite he
but it be because of he


can sam add

yes

how about multiplication

he be learning

so what you be saying be that sam can
not even multiply two time two

i do not know about you mr
turner but
i fond memory of i parent have
nothing to do with time table or state
capital

i bet he be knocking on you door all the
time with question

yes
all the time
the last question
be whether to use biz or clorox to get
the grass stain out of Lucys soccer
uniform

so let we see
he do not know math
he
can not even wash she clothes
how about
puberty
i can only imagine how much
insight he will bring to approaching the
sensitive issue of a young girl
development

mr
turner show i a father any
father who know how to do that and
i will give they the parent of the year
award

and you have have plenty of opportunity to
observe father have not you

objection

but the fact that ms
cassell have not
come out of she room in year might have
some effect on she perception

listening to nina simone
there be a
line in it that go something like i
love you i love you i love you

they put that into the song
it
would not be the same song without that
it make the song complete
that be why
the whole world cry when they broke up
on april

living at home

no

be you living with you mother and
father

in an institution

so you parent put you in an
institution

only after i mom get sick

what about you father
where be he

go with the wind when sam be born

so you be not raised by you mother

i see she i see she

when

christmas easter and i birthday

so in
a way the people at the institution
be you parent
be they nice to
you

some yes
some on
some yes

do they hit you

sometimes
sometimes they do
sometimes

like when you hit Lucys friend at she
birthday party

objection
nobody hit anybody

let i rephrase that strongarmed
so
what role model do you call upon as a
father when you be parent lucy
the
head of the institution
the principal
the warden

no
not mr
whitehead
not he

then who

myself

you have the mental capacity of a seven
year old
so you ask yourself a seven
year old

i be not a sevenyear old

how to parent a fellow sevenyear old

yes
no
what be the question

the question be
what make you think
you can be a parent
you background
you
you friend who can not even
testify for you

objection

i friend

objection

i friend love lucy even if rita
think they be not smart enough to
testify
even if she said you would wipe
the floor with they

excuse i mr
dawson you lawyer just
object
that mean you do not have to
answer the question
you can not even
follow the simple rule you have watch
here day after day
you really think
you can raise a sevenyear old
ten
year old
thirteenyear old
that mean she will be six year more
advance than you

i have have a lot of time to think about
whatever it be that make somebody a
good parent
it have to do with
constancy
it have to do with patience
it have to do with listening
to
pretend to listen when you can not even
listen anymore

it have to do with love like she say

and i do not know where it be written that
a woman have a corner on that market
that a man have any less of those
emotion than a woman
billy have a home
with i
it be not perfect
i be not a
perfect parent
sometimes i forget he be
just a little kid
we build a life together and we love
each other and if you destroy that it
may be irrep irrep irrep

irreparable

no
we already do
do not tell

a lovely

it will look
great on lucy

furthermore so that

up

all of that be well and good but the
fact that mr
dawson quite he job
missed he hear and do not even
show up for he visit with he
daughter

the fact that i client go through
profound depression be the most natural
reaction any parent could have

but once again he have no idea how he
behavior during that depression impacted
on he daughter

in these next month mr
dawson will be
expanding he support system to include
social service program tutor

it be too late
the foster family be
petition the court for sole custody
of lucy and i fully support they
request

be not it illegal

it be very
complicate

parent lobby for a child it change

he do not exist
as if he be a ghost

there be one option we have never talk
about sam
i know what you go through the last
time you take the stand
we could
settle out of court ask for the most
incredible visitation right it would
almost seem like joint custody

that be what you said last time and look
