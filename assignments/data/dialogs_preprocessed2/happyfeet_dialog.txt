i find out who be be cause the
scarcity

i make contact with alien
they be coming here
right behind i
listen

who be do all the shout

he be bad than before

no honestly alien will be here soon
you have to believe i
we come in a big
hollow bird and they landed on the ice
and

you again
and still full of the same old
nonsense

but it true

move along everyone
pay no attention
there be no such thing as alien

so who fixed he up with this

do it hurt
it not make of feather that be for
sure
what be it going to do


it be so they can find i
that be they now
listen

head for the sea

they foot
do it

now look what you have do

it the end of the world
it all mumble fault
i told you

just do what the kid say


recite the wisdom
together we stand
divided we freeze

come on everyone
happy foot
it be we
only chance

when all other leave we remain









that be it
excellent
riba riba
penguinos
shake those hip
come on bust a move

adhere to the wisdom
the ancient will
protect we


alien
i never doubt it for a moment

more feelink


you know who that be
that be i boy

know he
he ee i star pupol
i

from that day on no one quite know how
it happen but the black iceberg begin
to disappear and the fish become abundant
once more

so what do you reckon


yes quite extraordinary
stare at the
screen some kind of neurological
disorder
a nutritional deficiency
perhaps
we would certainly back the
longterm study

and the international treaty

yes
this be exactly the leverage we need
for an embargo
no fish
whatsoever
legal illegal sanction
whatever

so we all step up police of the pirate
factory ship
and we pressure that
country to stop they socalled
experimental fish

yes if we government ask you
government to approach they government
to call off they fleet

well if they government hear it from
we government via you government

what the heck
the amount of publicity
this be generate they would have world war
three if they do not stop



Ellas give up teaching to look after we
chick
we take turn looking after she
and going to get the fish




i worry about she sure
there be so much
big stuff out there it can be kind of
frighten


but the way i see it
there be so much out
there we do not understand

the stuff you think be small stuff
could actually be the big stuff


or be i not making sense here

be there a problem
i think this one
be barren

more or less
but one of the star we be
harvest support these thing here


so

well
exactly
but what we do not know
about before be these thing here

just think you would want to see they
before
you know

hmm
charming

so
we go ahead
or

no
well leave they be
see what
sector twelves get to offer instead
