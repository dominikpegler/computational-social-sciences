there be not anyway known to

oh certainly man can try to fight
it
but faith and believe be
mane only chance
you must have
faith

i have faith
but not always
sometimes it elude i
i can not
remember to remember it

but that be natural
you can not expect
to be perfect in what you try to
do

i do not know

i hear what happen at breakfast
this morning with the
guard

will they do something to i
what
have you hear

putting he arm around

nothing absolutely nothing
do not
worry about it
i just wanted you
to know that i believe you handle
yourself admirably

that be one time i do not care for
the laugh i be get from some
of the man

of course you do not
but i be sure
you know man laugh for two reason
one because something be funny
two because they fear showing fear
they laugh because there but for
the grace of god go i


do you really think so

i be certain of it

thank you johann
i always feel so
much good after you talk to i

i be glad helmut i be very glad
you know you can always talk to i
about anything

oh
i almost forget

before breakfast this morning i
speak to one of the guard a very
intelligent one and he seem quite
nice and friendly too
well he
said that the gestapo have set up a
special review board to handle case
just like mine
and he said he would
get i a form a special form
just
be printed up
and i be to fill it
out
be not that good

how many time since you have be
here have you filled out form
twenty
thirty time

but this be different
it be entirely
new

see
these be make up by the gestapo
itself
and the form will go
directly to berlin to gestapo
headquarters
that be the important
thing about this
the Gestapos in
on it
that be a very good sign
be not it a good sign

yes i son it be a good sign

in fast excite
scanning the paper
and i have to be very careful of
everything i put down on the form
the tiny detail could make the
difference
do not you agree

be not it strange
they be free to
go anywhere they want and they come
here to nest

watch the bird eat helmut
it be
so cute

i be sure i have get everything here
the important fact from the moment
i be arrested the question the
gestapo officer ask i
now
what be he name again
i can not
seem to remember what he name be



what the devil be he name



oh yes johann
i be sorry
you
be saying

you be not a religious man be you
helmut

well i
ah

not sure i be myself anymore

yet
when i see those bird i
wonder
be they send here to
let we know this place really be not
god forsake

he should have send they elsewhere
they could be eat here


i think we should eat it

not on you life
er that be
i would not

put it somewhere so it can brighten
up the place

it would take a hell of a lot more
than that to brighten up this place

it will be good than looking at you
long face

do you see the way it be sprout
i told you it be not completely
rotten

that be nice johann
do you remember
when i filled out those last form
the date might be important

about four week ago i think

i will put it up here on the window
sill it will get the morning sun

think you can trust you potato so
close to i reverend

it be you he
do not trust
