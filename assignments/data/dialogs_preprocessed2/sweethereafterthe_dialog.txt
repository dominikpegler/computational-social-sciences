mrs
otto i name be mitchell
stephens
the walker told i you
might be will to talk to i

i be sorry for coming over
unannounced like this mrs
otto
but the walker said you would
understand
i know it be an awful
time but it be important that we
talk

who be you

i be a lawyer

you can not come here

please let i explain
i will only
take a moment of you time

no

please


we have a guest
what do you say
you name be

mitchell stephens

the walker send he by

you want a cup of tea or something

cup of tea would be nice
would it be alright if i sit down
for a few minute mrs
otto
i
want to talk to you

the walker speak very highly of
you

you have be retain

yes

they child die and they get a
lawyer

it should be say that i task be to
represent the walker only in they
anger
not they grief

who do they get for that

you be angry be not you mrs
otto
that be why i be here
to give
you anger a voice
to be you
weapon against whoever cause that
bus to go off the road

dolores

it be i belief that dolores be
do exactly what she would be do
for year
besides the school
board insurance on dolores be
minimal
few million at the very
most
the really deep pocket be
to be find in the town or in the
company that make the bus

you think someone else cause the
accident

mrs
otto there be no such thing
as an accident
the word do not
mean anything to i
as far as i be
concern somebody somewhere make a
decision to cut a corner
some
corrupt agency or corporation
account the cost variance between
a tencent bolt and a million dollar
outofcourt settlement
they
decided to sacrifice a few live for
the difference
that be what be do
mrs
otto
i have see it happen so
many time before

but dolores said she see a dog and
tried to

how long have dolores be driving
that bus mr
otto
how many time
have she steer clear of danger
what go wrong that morning

someone calculate ahead of time
what it would cost to sacrifice
safety
it be the dark most
cynical thing to imagine but it be
absolutely true
and now it be up
to i to make they build that bus
with an extra bolt or add an extra
yard of guard rail
it be the only
way we can ensure moral
responsibility in this society
by
what i do

so you be just the thing we need

excuse i

be not that what you want we to
believe
that we be completely
defenseless
that you know what be
best

listen to i mrs otto
listen very
carefully
i do know what be good
as we be sitting here the town or
the school board or the manufacturer
of that bus be lining up a battery
of they own lawyer to negotiate
with people as griefstricken as
yourselves
and this make i very
very mad
it be why i come all the
way up here
if everyone have do
they job with integrity you son
would be alive this morning and
safely in school
i promise you
that i will pursue and reveal who it
be that do not do they job

who be responsible for this tragedy
then in you name and the walker
name and the name of whoever decide
to join we i shall sue
i shall
sue for negligence until they bleed

i want that person to go to jail
for the rest of he life
i want
he to die there
i do not want his
money

it be unlikely that anyone will go to
prison mrs
otto
but he or he
company will pay in other way
and
we must make they pay
not for the
money or to compensate you for the
loss of you son
that can not be
do
but to protect other innocent
child
you see i be not just
here to speak for you anger but
for the future as well
what we be talking about be an
ongoing relationship to time

i do not ask if you wanted milk

no
little sugar though

we have only get honey

i will
take it straight

be you expensive

no

if you agree to have i represent
you in this suit i will require no
payment until after the case be win
when i will require one third of the
award amount
if there be no
award make then i service will
cost you nothing
it be a standard
agreement

do you have this agreement with you

it be in i car

i will just be a minute
anyhow you
should discuss this all without i
before you make any decision

father of a drug addict be suppose
to do


continuing from
voice over

hospital she be see all the good

two
week later she be on the street
new york vancouver pittsburgh

there be a rustle seem like a
bustle
of merry crowd justling at pitch
and hustle

shoe clatter
little hand clap and little
tongue chattering
and like fowl in a farmyard when

out come the child running
all the little boy and girl
with rosy cheek and flaxen curl
and sparkling eye and tooth like
pearl
trip and skip run merrily
after
the wonderful music with shouting
and laughter

when lo as they reach the
mountainside
wondrous portal opened wide
as if a cavern be suddenly
hollowed
and the piper advance and the
child follow
and when all be in to the very
last
the door in the mountainside shut
fast

where water gushed and fruittrees
grow
and flower put forth a fair hue

might have be a dog or a small
deer or maybe even a lose child
it
might have be an optical illusion
or a mirage
whatever it be for
the rest of i life i will remember
that redbrown blur


every time i get on one of these
flight to rescue zoe i remember
the summer we almost lost she
she
be three year old
it happen in
the morning at this cottage we used
to rent
we be all sleep
together in bed
it be a wonderful
time in we live
we still think
we have a future together the three
of we
do you ever visit the
cottage


i
do not think so

i wake to the sound of Zoes
breathe
it be laboured
i
look over and notice she be
sweat and all swell
i grab
she rush to the kitchen and
splash water on she face

what happen

i do not know
i be in a panic
i
guess she would be bitten by an
insect but there be no doctor
the near hospital be forty mile
away and zoe be continuing to
swell
klara take she in she arm
and tried to breastfeed she while
i dialed the hospital
i finally
get a doctor on the line
he
sound young but cool
he be
confident but there be a
nervousness
he have be an
intern
this be the first time he
ever have to deal with anything like
this
he wanted to seem like he
know what he be do but he be
just as scare as i be


he surmise that there be a nest of
baby black widow spider in the
mattress
he told i they have to be
baby or else with Zoes body
weight she would be dead
he told i i
have to rush she to the hospital
he
be alone
there be no ambulance
available
now you listen he
said there be a good chance you can
get she to i before she throat
close but the important thing be
to keep she calm
he ask if
there be one of we she be more
relaxed with than the other
i
said yes with i



which be true enough especially at
that moment
klara be wildeyed
with fear and she fear be
contagious
i be a good actor
than she be that be all
zoe loved
we equally then
just like she
hate we both equally now
the doctor told i that i should
hold she in i lap and let klara
drive to the hospital
he ask i
to bring a small sharp knife
it
have to be clean
there be no time
to sterilize properly
he explain
how to perform an emergency
tracheotomy
how to cut into i
daughter throat and windpipe
without cause she to bleed to
death
he told i there would be a lot
of blood
i said i do not think i
could do it
if she throat close
up and stop she breathe you will
have to mr
stephens
you will have
a minute and a half two minute
maybe and she will probably be
unconscious when you do it
but if
you can keep she calm and relax
if you do not let she little heart
beat too fast and spread the poison
around then you might just make it
over here first
you get going
now and he hung up


it be an unforgettable drive
i
be divided into two people
one
part of i be daddy singing a
lullaby to he little girl

the other part be a surgeon ready
to cut into she throat
i wait
for the second that Zoes breath
stopped to make that incision


what happen

nothing
we make it to the
hospital
i do not have to go as
far as i be prepared to
but i be
prepared to go all the way




i know you would be here

be you going to the funeral

i stopped by the station a while
ago
i stare at the bus
i could
almost hear the kid inside
there
be a lawyer there
he told i he would
get you signed up
be that true

something make this happen billy
mr
stephens be going to find out
what it be

an accident

mr
stephens say that someone
do not put a right bolt in the
bus

Risa i service that bus
at the
garage
there be nothing wrong with
it

or that the guardrail be not
strong enough

you believe that

i have to

why

because i have to

well i do not

be it true that you give nicole one
of Lydias dress
that she be
wearing it when the bus crashed

yes

why do you do that billy

you think that cause the accident
Risa
that it bring bad luck
christ it sound to i you be
looking for a witch doctor not a
lawyer
or maybe they be the same
thing

you know what i be going to miss
more than making love
it be the
night you could not get away from
wendell
it be the night i would sit in
that chair for an hour
smoke
cigarette and remembering i life
before


i be here about you child mr
ansel

i name be

mister i do not want to know you
name

i understand

no you do not

i can help you

not unless you can raise the dead

here
you may change you mind

mr
mitchell stephens esquire
would you be likely to sue i if i
be to beat you right now
beat you
so bad that you pissed blood and
could not walk for a month
because
that be what i be about to do

no mr
ansel
i would not sue you

leave we alone stephens
leave the
people of this town alone
you
can not help

you can help each other
several
people have agreed to let i
represent they in a negligence suit
you case as an individual will be
strong if i be allow to represent
you together as a group

case

the walker have agreed
the Ottos
nicole Burnells parent
it be
important to initiate proceeding
right away
thing get covered up
people lie
that be why we have to
begin we investigation quickly
before the evidence disappear
that be why i be out here tonight

i know Risa and wendell walker
they would not hire a goddamned
lawyer
and the Ottos would not deal
with you
we be not country
bumpkin you can put a big city
hustle on
you be trying to use we

you be angry mr
ansel
you owe it
to yourself to feel that way
all
i be saying be let i direct you
rage

that be i daughter
or it may be
the police to tell i that they have
find she dead
she be a drug
addict

why be you telling i this

i be telling you this because
we have all lost we child mr
ansel

they be dead to we
they kill each
other in the street
they wander
comatose in shop mall
they be
paralyze in front of television
something terrible have happen
that be taken we child away
it be too late
they be go


i have a question for you mr
stephens

what be that dolore

i told you that i be do fifty
mile an hour when the accident
happen
that be how i remembered
it
but the truth be i might have
be do sixty
or sixty five
and if that be true that i be over
the limit when the bus go over
what would happen then

that would complicate thing

because i would be to blame right

billy ansel will insist that you
be driving fiftyone mile an
hour
just like you have do every
morning for the past fifteen year

he know that
billy

yes
he do

billy said that

you have talk to billy

i do

and billy told you that he will tell
that to

mrs
driscoll if billy ansel do
not volunteer to say so in court i
will subpoena he and oblige he to
testify to that effect

but in order to do that you must
let i bring a suit in you name
charging negligent infliction of
emotional harm
that be what i be now
asking you to consider

it be clear to i and other people
that you have suffer significantly
from this event

what other people

excuse i

who be be talking to you about what
i be feeling
who should care about
what i be feeling

dolores people have to know that
you have suffer too

and they will not understand until you
let i clear you name you good
name once and for all
will you
let i do that
will you let i do
i duty

you hear what abbott said

yes

anything you do not understand

there might have be a word or two
that slipped by
maybe you could
clarify it for i just to be
absolutely sure

abbott said that the true jury of a
persona peer be the people of she
town
only they the people who
have known she all she life and not
twelve stranger can decide she
guilt or innocence
and if i have
committed a crime then it be a crime
against they so they be the one
who must decide i punishment

that be what he said be it

yes
abbot understand these
thing



the mind be kind

they say i be lucky because i can not
remember the accident

do not even try to remember

you and you mom and dad and some
other folk here in town
we be
trying to generate some
compensation however meager for
what you have suffer and at the
same time see that an accident like
this never happen again
you be
central to the case i be trying to
build nicole
but you would probably
just as soon let the whole thing
lie
just get on with you life as
quickly and smoothly as possible

i do not like think about the
accident
i do not even remember it
happening
besides it just make
people feel sorry for i and

you hate that

what she mean mitch

people can not help it you know
they really can not
when they see
you in this wheelchair knowing what
you life be life eight month ago
people be going to feel sorry for
you
there be no way around it
nicole
you and i just meet and
already i admire you
who would not
you be a brave tough smart kid
that be obvious
and i do not know
you know how exciting and promise
you life be before the accident
but listen even i feel sorry for
you

you can only feel lucky that you
do not die for so long
then you
start to feel
unlucky

that you do not die
like the other
child

yes
like bear and the ansel twin
and sean and

nicole

it be the truth

it be the truth

it would be strange if you do not
feel that way

after a slight
pause
what do you want i to do for you
mr
stephens


that get you talking about
deposition and lawyer
by the
time daddy come back from the
washroom and mom come in with she
tea and cooky you be going on
about how tough it would be for i
to answer some of the question
those other lawyer would ask

they work for the people we be
trying to sue
they job be to try
to minimize damage
we job
nicole be to try to maximize they
you have to think of it that way
as people do they job
no good
guy or bad guy
just we side and
they side

i will not lie

i do not want you to lie

the truth be that it be an
accident and no one to blame

there be no such thing as an
accident nicole
not in a
situation like this

you seem very sure about that

i be absolutely positive

no matter what i be ask i will tell
the truth

that be fine
i want you to be
absolutely truthful
and i will be
right there to advise and help you
and there be a court stenographer
there to make a record of it and
that be what will go to the judge
before the trial be set
it will be
the same for everybody
they will be
depose the Ottos and the walker
the bus driver

dolores

yes
dolores
and even you mom
and dad
but i will make sure you go
last

why

so you can keep on get well
before you have to go and do this
it be not going to be easy nicole
do you understand that

when do they award damage

depend
this could drag on for
quite a while
but we will be there
at the end sam
do not you worry

at that moment i hated i parent
daddy for what he know and have do

and even mom for what she do not
know and have not do
you told i
it be not going to be easy
but as
i sit there stare at daddy i

mother


i smile at he but he only glare
back at i as if i be to blame


for he lead we he said to a joyous
land
join the town and just at hand
where water gushed and fruittrees
grow
and flower put forth a fair hue
and everything be strange and
new
