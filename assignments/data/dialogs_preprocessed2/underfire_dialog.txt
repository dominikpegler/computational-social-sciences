offensive the people of nicaragua

even washington be
starting to admit that the butcher
somoza be not loved by he people
they have detain twentyfive million
dollar in new arm shipment for
somoza at an airfield in florida
until they find out if rafael be
alive or dead

do you understand

yeah
Commandante
soy un periodista

this have nothing to do with journalism
there be more to the world than
journalism
we be going to end this
war with you or without you
people do not really believe in rafael
they believe in the idea of rafael
no
because for now the idea of rafael
be enough for the people of nicaragua
when the war be over none of this
matter

i do not do thing
like this

enough live have be lost already
it be difficult i know but you
must do it

in the morning eh
when there be
well light


i spend i whole life separating how
i feel from how i think and what i
see from what i say that be called
journalism be not it

it be disciplined
it civilize
it
involve distinction
i be great at
distinction
i wish i be not so
good at they
sometimes i envy you
you do not make any it be very
convenient
the only time i do not worry about
all those thing be when i be with i
daughter

or when you be in bed

yes
beat change
direction
i job be to find a story then tell
a story whatever it be because
i believe that if enough people hear
enough story then somehow through
information alone we all have a
good chance to survive
i believe in information
that be a very romantic streak i have
running through i maybe it be a
weakness
information be good
lack of information be bad
simple
eh

not so simple

you be god damn right it be not
you take that picture you will take it
for all the right reason i
understand

i be not going to take it

that be fine for you
but do i go
back and say i interview rafael
do i go back and say i missed the
big story of the war
or do i
say rafael be stone cold dead
that be the information be not it
or
do i say he entertain we all in
he inimitably charismatic manner
around the ol revolutionary campfire
can we throw up we arm and say we
fell in love with the querillas
because they because be
sympathetic
journalist do not fall in love
which story do you want i to tell

do what you want to do

christ what the fuck be we do
