an empty breeze blow across a desert cemetery
we
hear the sound of then nineteenth
century boot
we they strolling past
the headstone and mausoleum
the sound of a and
in the distance



there come a time for every vampire
when the idea of eternity become
momentarily unbearable
as we an old stone tomb the boot leap up and

to reveal
stand steadily atop the roof of the tomb
silhouette against the moon like a large black bird



the wound suffer from love and
fail friendship do not heal like
a human but seem to only gape
large
the long to be mortal
return a long for finiteness
beat as the indistinct figure gaze out at the night






the figure enter an alabaster tomb and close the door



in i suffer such a spell
and decided to cease feeding on
blood
just lie in the earth and
let time return to it natural
state
as the the of a fledgling vine
growing up the side of the tomb begin to
and until curiously time seem to speed up
night pass to day and back to night
shadow from the
sun and moon drift across the tomb
as day and month
fly by the vine wind and grow in circuitous pattern
all around the tomb






i have hope the sound of the
pass era would fade out and a
kind of death might happen

kind of forget where i would
be heal from i wound
the of and the of
the and of



but as i lay there the sound
do not fade but grow with the
world
the of the sound of a
overhead

a medley of from this century




and gradually the world do not
sound like the place i have left
but something different
well
as we the now vinecovered tomb of
the s s s



new fearless attitude have
possess the world brave and
godless
i begin to wonder if it
be not time to resurrect
but
the thing that eventually bring
i back the decisive thing
really come like a bolt out of
the blue
and the raw
and dark

slender hand with long painted nail gothic ring and
a halfpound of silver bracelet play they instrument
long hair body piercings celtic tattoo and brightly colored
nylon show a lot of pale smooth flesh
in the
confusion of glimpse it be hard to tell who be a boy or
girl but they be all young and beautiful
break in
on the of and
than the rest






music so sublime so deeply
vampiric i have no doubt it could
be hear in hades

ah jesse
you want to come and
play with we do not you



jesse

soon soon little one
i will make
sure you be with we forever



jesse



no























i have reason to believe Lestats
the real thing
vampire
and
an ancient one

i do not know jesse
it look to
i like the guy get a good

man with a flair for the
theatrical

lean forward
eagerly
it would appear that way
but
have you listen to he song
read he lyric




well i have
in one of he song
he refer to a pub called the
sailor arm
i think it be a
clue

where be you now
back in the
sailor arm somewhere in the
back street of soho
i track
down the old lease in london
it
turn out in the late s
there be a pub right in the
backstreet of soho called the
sailor arm

and it have a reputation for
dealing with black magic
witch coven seance that
sort of thing

and most importantly report of
people be lure there and
subsequently attack by
bloodsuck fiend

here where you could find the
sailor arm in old london




and here be where it would be
today
of course the sailor
arm be not there anymore
that
part of london be mostly old
warehouse meatpacking plant

in a few year it will be artist
loft and pretentious french
cafe

yes but right now there be only
one place to get a drink of
sort
private club in
exactly the same place
the
waverly arm

well what happen at the waverly
arm now make the sailor arm
look like a happy meal at
mcdonalds

it be a vampire coven
and
Lestats leading we to it

and what make you think so

jesse can you uh focus that any
well




excitement dampen
by embarrassment
well
it be taken
while
in motion

quickly trying to
cover
but listen if you look closely
you can see they be vampire
i be
sure of it
and Lestats lead
we to they and

interesting
perhaps we should
assign someone to observe

oh please base on this socalled
data
that be a waste of time

but
uh

looking up for a
moment interrupting
wait a second
who take this
picture

i do

you go there

yes
last night

and who give you this directive




no one
i
just
go
look i know it be breaking
protocol and i be really sorry
it be just i think

jesse
you be just an apprentice
here
you must follow we
rule
or perhaps we need to
reconsider you position

for century we mission as
Talamascans have be to observe
and record paranormal behavior
but never get involve
you be
get far too close

gesture to photo
defending herself
hey do it look like i get
involve
that be not called
involvement
that be called
run

leaning forward
trying to help
but jesse tell we what do you
see

vampire
gathering
i be sure of
it

you have to listen to Lestats
lyric
they be amazing




many of the reference could only
be derive from year of research
in the Bibliotech de paris which
seem unlikely for a young rock
star in he early twenties
plus
there be historical detail
dating back hundreds of year
lestat describe that do not exist
anywhere
except in we library
he refer to marius the great
white lord who rule over a group
of island off the bay of naples
in the late th century
what
i be trying to say here and maybe
i be not do the good job of it
be that lestat may be the old
and most powerful vampire ever
documented

it do not make any sense
why
would he be forecasting this to
the world
he be all but draw a
map and marked an
what
vampire hold sacred be keeping
they kind a secret
you never
name other immortal tell where
they lair be
they would be hunt
down

right
that be the good part
Lestats not afraid to piss they
off
he want mortal and
immortal to know he be there to
know he exist
i do not know
why
glance at skeptical
Talamascan
but this have never happen
before
do not you see
he be a
one man revolution




and this photo be you evidence
it be hardly conclusive
mon
it look like the blair
witch

fine
well then i guess i will
just have to go back and get
well more conclusive evidence
maybe you just can not unravel all
the mystery of the world out
there by sitting around all day
in a dusty old library in here



jesse

i office
now

lestat lunge like a phantom a flash of tooth as
they the distinct sound of

over this scene the rush in



lestat enter
dab he mouth politely with a white
handkerchief the sound of the practice from

je suis le vampire lestat
i be the vampire lestat








it be the winter of and i
be bring to a mediterranean
island by the man who make i



if a man be what you would call
he



lestat
welcome




who be you
do i know you

i be unknowable by nature

but you may call i marius

i be the lord of a great manor
they will send an army of man to
look for i

i doubt they will find you
lord de Lioncourt
you be a long
way from home

you be weak
near pass
i
can barely hear you heartbeat

i will kill you

you really do fear nothing
it be
why i choose you
because you
think thing be possible which
be not possible

choose i
for what

i companion
someone to share i
burden

you have lost a great deal of blood




i be dying

then drink

good be it not

drink and live
you have be brave
enough for one night i son



drink
drink and learn




there
there
that will do

no
no more
lestat no more

do not be afraid it be only you
body that die

more





i impress i maker with i
thirst for thing
he set out to
educate i in the unknown
teach
i all about the world it hide
history
and about myself




that be enough i son
when you
feed you must hold back from the
moment of death
you must never
take the last drop or it will
draw you in and you will die

remember there be wisdom in the
flesh lestat
man wear his
history on he skin

i be talking about humanity

humanity
we be murderer

we be more than that
they blood
that we take into we carry with
it life
they life they
knowledge they complexity
appreciate you prey lestat








i sense run amok like a newborn
child
and as for i new power
i be beside myself with the
pleasure of it all

the trick be to find the way to
face eternity head on
the
spirit can be annihilate by
boredom just as the body can be
destroyed by sun or fire
i
solace i delight be witnessing
the unfold of human destiny

from christ to the dark age
to the enlightenment i have never
be able to divine what be coming
that be what keep i going i
can not wait to see what human
being be going to do next

who could have predict the
enlightenment
or hannibal and he
elephant

careful




but why must we hide marius
we
be the powerful we be the
immortal
we should walk fearless
in the open

shhh
the life of a vampire be a
life of discretion
we must sleep
during the day when we be
vulnerable to the sun
mortal
must never know about we
it be
forbid for the sake of all we
kind

gazing at violin
player as it sink in
so i could never know she

not unless you wanted to kill she

beat quietly
intensely
so i can never be known

you be known by i
i grant you
that
there be other of we
kind
though most be solitary
creature

i god

forget god
you be no longer in
he realm
now we must leave




fantasma
Teras

stop she lestat

you must





i will not have you put everything
at risk
you will mind we law

we remain in the shadow
to do
otherwise be a road to
destruction

i see you still have a few
lingering mortal emotion
they
will serve you no good lestat

i god what have you do to i

she be just a child
forgive i







the face of i victim haunted
i rising behind i eye
remind i of i fate
i
play for day trying to expel
the last bit of i human
feeling
and face the cold
dark wasteland of eternity













wow
this be the cool after
hour club ever
you sure you
do not want a drink

soon





every coven going









come here often

sure all the time




do not see any mark

you have not see the rest of i
body

be that an invitation

so where be you host

i host
oh he be here somewhere

you host
what be he name

marius



sorry
do not know the guy




marius have the blood of the
ancient flowing in he vein

there be not any ancient left
they all turned to dust

that be a myth
marius be around
here somewhere

you
you really should meet he

and why be that

because
because
he be wise a
philosopher
he ask the big
question
like how be you going
to get through eternity
it be
easier for we mortal
life be
brief but for you

i mean
what can you really do
with immortality besides just slip
from one day to the next trapped
in a void of meaninglessness
relieve only by you next victim
how do you not give in to despair
and just wither away from boredom
hopelessness




you know it be like they say
the more thing change the more
they stay the same
for you
that be forever right

you know you be really a
downer




now this be not going to hurt
you
might even enjoy it




you saved i

perhaps

jesse close the journal she eye wide with the new
knowledge of Lestats past
she sit there a moment
speechless then stare out at the vast black night





to lestat standing on the edge of a very high
fence high above the sparkling light of downtown
gazing into the dark night
the fence encircle his
hollywood hills home a hightech modern version of a
medieval fortress of steel and glass hidden deep in
the canyon he only neighbor chaparral and coyote
lestat close he eye as if listening to something
as
we again and the sky a
begin to play and magically we be in the
and with a visual splash we be

the globe with the as we the world
the west and
the night fallen over asia
where we soon find ourselves in

where play for the evening shift over a
sweatshop

where play from in a shop
window
we

where the
ground split open before we very eye
from out of the dirt a beautiful teenage boy stand
naked

he pull the piece of a wormeaten coffin from his
person as the travel far to

parting as another resurrected figure rise from the
darkness and reveal itself to be


with one selfassured twist of she head she shake the
red dust from she hair to reveal long curl black
tress falling down over she darkskinned shoulder
the travel far to

hold by a camel driver camping out in the sahara desert
he fearfully
the camel driver stare
before he dropjawed and terrify and we now see what
he see

corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begin to move as
a figure in tattered rag emerge from the sarcophagus and
unbandages he face and neck shake the sand from his
hair and eye to reveal a skeletal form with white
leathery skin bulge with strange blue vein

the offer the driver a polite smile
the driver faint back into the sand as the camel bolt
off
and still play as we finally


an the of Enkil sitting motionless in
he throne not resurrect at all
akasha and she
throne remain

we to reveal
Enkils
throat gape torn open and whereas before he skin
be pale it be now a chalkish powder
and next to he

immediately

lestat and then will go back to she
slumber
that be we only hope
