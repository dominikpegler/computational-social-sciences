come to think of it you well turn
around and drive right back to aspen

they be murdered
i find the body
on alder crick northeast of here
like i said if i be you i would go
back because the man who killed
they might be on this road

back to what

why back to aspen where you come
from

aspen do not want we mr
graham
they threw we out

they should not have do that

we tried to point that out
but there
be some pretty nosey citizen who
would not listen to reason
they said
aspen have outgrown we
it be all right
to play poker in you own home but
not in a saloon

i know something would happen when

he know what root to eat when you be
clear out of food
he know the
difference between a possum and a
coon just by lookin at the track
more than most trapper know

after a backward
glance
they be stragglin

he letter will keep

steve i want you to learn to read

you but i do not want you forgettin
you job

i will not again

this be not like other trip we have
taken
for one thing we have get a
wagonload of woman
for another
there be a guy wanderin around hopin
to put a bullet in i back

Okeh i be wrong
but you can not
expect a fellow who never see Lednov
and never hear he name until a
while ago to do too much worryin
you have be sorta close mouth about
he

i guess i have
you be pretty little
when they locked he up
i do not
suppose you even remember that time
i be go two month

sure i remember
you go to mexico
lookin for cattle

nod
then after a
moment
you remember jeff rawson
we used
to go fish and hunting with he
when you be so high

sure i do
go off down to mexico
or something

that be what i told you then
only he
do not
Lednov killed he

oh
that be the time you go away

i caught up with Lednov in nogales
he do not like the idea of comino
back across the border but he come
i turned he over to the sheriff and
that be the story

maybe you shoulda killed he

maybe i should
but i be never much
on killin
anyway he moved too
quick and i just get he through the
shoulder
look pretty peaceful up ahead

yeah it do

but you never can tell
why do not
you get that new rifle out of the
wagon

and while you be there you might as
well find out what come after



elaine stop it

she should be in bed where it be dry

but the near shelter the wyatt
ranch and that be maybe five hour
away

can we get a doctor at that ranch

then i know i alphabet

from to
all you have to do now
be figure out what they mean put
together in word

and that be tough be not it

without someone to teach you it be
tough

he know he alphabet

that be fine

i will bet i would be reading in a week if

maybe clay will take up where i left
off

i do not think it be fair

leaving they here when we could just
as well take they
we get plenty of
room in the wagon
and and
they cook and drive the mule
they
do not bother anybody

finish son

there be only two of they now

i will round up the horse
throw that
junk in the wagon

you be right a man have only so
many noe in he
but he have i
worried that last one sound so
final



it be a lot tough than i figure
Knowin i letter be one thing
but
makin sense out of word be hard
trackin weasel after rain

and even if i do learn to read
what use it be
i be going to live
on a ranch

there be plenty of use for read
you will see

younicorn
what in heck
that

unicorn a kind of animal

what do they look like

hmmm
sort of like a horse with
a horn in the center of it forehead

horse with horn
huh
do we have
they in nevada

no

how about california

would they be good to eat

kind of tough i guess
but you be
not liable to hunt they i do not
think there be any alive now anyway
and i be not sure but i do not think
there ever be

then if they be not alive how can
they be an animal

an if you can not hunt they and even
if you could they would be tough what be
the use of knowin how to spell they

you do not read to fill you stomach
poetry for instance
all the poem
in the world would not fill you half
as much as a bowl of eatmeal but
they make you feel good

i feel good anyway

do not go argue with you teacher

i be not but there be some of it i
do not see any sense to

there be a lot of thing i do not see
any sense to
but make up you mind
learn to read or
go back and watch the horse

till i say the
word you be do what you be tell

you oughta say you be sorry that be
what you oughta do

you keep you nose out of i life

of they you do
i do not blame you
because i understand you way of
think and why you think that way
you want you woman on pedestal
but they have to be born on they
they can fall off but they can not
climb back up

i can not help how i think
