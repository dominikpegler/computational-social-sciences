america have make i fortune

i raised i daughter in the american
fashion
i give she freedom but
taught she never to dishonor she
family
she find a boy friend
not an italian
she go to the
movie with he stay out late
two month ago he take she for a
drive with another boy friend
they make she drink whiskey and
then they tried to take advantage
of she
she resist
she keep she
honor
so they beat she like an
animal
when i go to the hospital
she nose be broken she jaw be
shattered and hold together by
wire and she could not even weep
because of the pain

i go to the police like a good
american
these two boy be
arrested and bring to trial
the
judge sentenced they to three year
in prison and suspended the
sentence
suspend sentence
they go free that very day
i
stand in the courtroom like a fool
and those bastard they smile at
i
then i said to i wife for
justice we must go to the godfather

Bonasera we know each other for
year but this be the first time
you come to i for help
i do not
remember the last time you invited
i to you house for coffee

what do you want of i
i will give
you anything you want but do what
i ask

and what be that Bonasera

no
you ask for too much

i ask for justice

the court give you justice

an eye for an eye

but you daughter be still alive

then make they suffer as she
suffer
how much shall i pay you

you never think to protect yourself
with real friend
you think it be
enough to be an american
all
right the police protect you
there be court of law so you
do not need a friend like i
but now you come to i and say don
corleone you must give i justice
and you do not ask in respect or
friendship
and you do not think to
call i godfather
instead you come
to i house on the day i daughter
be to be marry and you ask i to
do murder
for money

america have be good to i

then take the justice from the
judge the bitter with the sweet
Bonasera
but if you come to i
with you friendship you loyalty
then you enemy become i enemy
and then believe i they would
fear you

what about that Tattaglias
what
will they do about bruno

part of the deal
bruno cancel out
what they do to i father

we should hear what they have to say

no no Consiglere

and when they shoot i father

yes even the shoot of you
father be business not personal

no no no more advice on how to
patch it up tom
you just help i
win
understand

i find out about this captain
mccluskey who broke mikes jaw
he be definitely on Sollozzos
payroll and for big money
McCluskeys agreed to be the turk
bodyguard
what you have to
understand be that while Sollozzo
be guarded like this he be
invulnerable
nobody have ever
gun down a new york police
captain
never
it would be
disastrous
all the five family
would come after you sonny
the
corleone family would be outcast
even the old mane political
protection would run for cover
so
just
take that into consideration

mccluskey can not stay with the turk
forever
we will wait

we can not wait
no matter what
Sollozzo say about a deal he be
figure out how to kill pop
you
have to get Sollozzo now

the kid right

what about mccluskey

let we say now that we have to kill
mccluskey
we will clear that up
through we newspaper contact later

go on mike

they want i to go to the conference
with Sollozzo
set up the meet
for two day from now
sonny get
we informer to find out where the
meet will be hold
insist it have to be a public place
a bar or restaurant at the height
of the dinner hour
so i will feel
safe
they will check i when i meet
they so i will not be able to carry a
weapon
but clemenza figure out a
way to have one planted there for
i
then i will kill they both

you
you the highclass college
kid
you never wanted to get mixed
up in the family business
now you
wanta gun down a police captain and
the turk just because you get
slap in the face
you be taking
it personal it be just business and
he be taking it personal

sonny it be all personal and i
learned it from he the old man
the godfather
he take i join
the marine personal
i take
Sollozzo trying to kill i father
personal and you know i will kill
they sonny



it be as cold as they come
impossible to trace
do not worry about print mike i
put a special tape on the trigger
and butt
here
he hand the gun to
another pair of hand
Whatsamatter
trigger too tight
it fire
very
i left it noisy so it will scare any
painintheneck innocent bystander
away

just let you hand drop to you
side and let the gun slip out
everybody will still think you get
it
they will be starin at you
face see
then walk out of the
place real fast but do not run
do not look anybody directly in the
eye but do not look away from they
neither
hey they will be scare
stiff o you believe i
Nobodys
going to bother with you
do not worry
about nothing
you would be surprise
how good these thing go



put you hat on let we see how you
look
help with identification

mostly it give witness an excuse
to change they identification when
we make they see the light
then
you take a long vacation and we
catch the hell

how bad will it be

probably all the other family
will line up against we
but it be
alright
these thing have to
happen once every ten year or
so
get rid of the bad blood
you get to stop they at the begin
like they shoulda stopped hitler at
munich they shoulda never let he
get away with that they be just
asking for big trouble

why do not you stop living like a
bum and get this place clean up

what be you inspect the
barracks
sit up with
he head in he hand
you ready

i
do not want he mother to see he
as he be


go to Clemenzas house and
tell he to come here right away
he will tell you what to do

give i a drop of anisette

i wife be weeping before she fell
asleep outside i window i see i
caporegimes to the house and it be
midnight
so Consigliere of mine
i think you should tell you don
what everyone know

i do not tell mama anything
i be
about to come up and wake you and
tell you
just now

but you needed a drink first

yes

now you have have you drink

they shoot sonny on the causeway
he be dead

i want no inquiry make
no act
of vengeance
Consigliere arrange a meet with
the head of the five
family
this war stop now

call Bonasera
he will do i a
service

this be tom hagen
i be calling for
don corleone at he request



yes i understand i be listening

you owe the don a service
he have
no doubt that you will repay it



i want to thank you all for coming
i consider it a service do to i
personally and i be in the debt of
each and every one of you
especially those of you who have
travele from such distance as
california st
louis kansas city
and new orleans

ah well let we get down to business
we be all honorable man here we
do not have to give assurance as if
we be lawyer
he sit gaze out
at they and sigh
how do thing ever go so far
well no matter
lot of
foolishness have come to pass
it
be so unfortunate so unnecessary

Tattaglia have lost a son
i have
lost a son
we be quits
let
there be a peace
he gesture
expressively
submissively with
he hand
that be all i want

don corleone be too modest
he have
the judge and politician in he
pocket and he refused to share they
he refusal be not the act of a
friend
he take the bread out of
the mouth of we family
time
have changed it be not like the old
day where everyone can go he own
way
if don corleone have all the
judge and politician in new york
then he must share they or let
other use they
certainly he can
present a bill for such service
we be not communist after all
but he have to let we draw water
from the well
it be that simple

i friend i do not refuse out of
malice
you all know i
when
have i ever refused an accommodation
but why this time
because i
think this drug business will
destroy we in the year to come
it be not like whiskey or gamble
or even woman which most people
want and be forbid they by the
pezzonovante of the church and the
government
but drug
no
even
policeman who help we in gamble
and other thing would refuse to
help we in drug
but
i be
will to do whatever all of you
think be necessary

i do not believe in drug
for
year i paid i people extra so
they would not do that kind of
business
a week
but it
do not matter
somebody come to
they and say i have powder if
you put up three four thousand
dollar investment we can make
fifty thousand distributing
who
can resist such a profit
there be no way to control it as a
business
to keep it respectable
i do not want it near school
i
do not want it sell to child
that be an infamita
in i city i would try to keep the
traffic in the dark people the
colored
they be the good
customer the least troublesome
and they be animal anyway
they
have no respect for they wife or
they family or themselves
let
they lose they soul with drug
but something have to be do we
can not have everybody running around
do just what they please like a
bunch of anarchist

then be we agreed
the traffic in
drug will be permitted but
control
and don corleone agree
to give it protection in the east

that be the whole matter then we
have the peace and let i pay i
respect to don corleone whom we
have all known over the year as a
man of he word
notice
be uneasy
don philip

i agree to everything here i be
will to forget i own misfortune
but i must hear strict assurance
from corleone
when time go by
and he position become strong
will he attempt any individual
vengeance

i forego i vengeance for i dead
son for the common good
but i
have selfish reason
i young
son have to flee accuse of
Sollozzos murder and i must now
make arrangement so that he can
come home with safety clear of
all those false charge
that be
i affair and i will make those
arrangement
but i be a superstitious man
and
so if some unlucky accident should
befall i young son if some
police officer should accidentally
shoot he or if he should hang
himself in he cell or if i son
be strike by a bolt of lightning
then i will blame some of the
people here
that i could never
forgive but
aside from that let
i swear by the soul of i
grandchildren that i will never be
the one to break the peace we have
make

when i meet with Tattaglias
people
should i insist that all
he drug middleman be clean

mention it do not insist
Barzini
be a man who will know that without
be tell

you mean Tattaglia

Barzini

he be the one behind Sollozzo

Tattaglia be a pimp
he could
never have outfought Santino
but
i be not sure until this day

excuse to start fight



mike you be wrong



don corleone
don corleone

you said there would come a day
when Tessio and i could form we
own family
only with you
benediction of course
i ask
permission

i son be head of the family now
if you have he permission you
have i good will

in six month you can break off
from the corleone family and go on
you own
carlo i be counting on
you to make the move to nevada
you will be i righthand man out
there
tom hagen be no long the
Consigliere

he be going to be we lawyer in
vegas
nobody go to he with any
other business as of now this
minute
no reflection on tom
that be the way i want it
besides
if i ever need any advice who be a
well Consigliere than i father

then in a six month time we be on
we own
be that it

maybe less

let we fill up we regime

no
i want thing very calm for
another six month

forgive i godfather let we
year of friendship be i excuse
how can you hope for success there
without you strength here to back
you up
the two go hand in hand
and with you go from here the
Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
too strong for we

and i do not like Barzini
i say
the corleone family have to move
from strength not weakness
we
should build we regime and take
back we lose territory in staten
island at least

do you have faith in i judgement

yes godfather

then do what michael say

all i can say be that thing be
be resolved that be more
effective than a thousand buttonmen
on the street
understand

understand
i just wish i be
do more to help out

i will come to you when i need you

all right then it be resolved

mike why be you cutting i out of
the action

tom we be going to be legitimate
all the way and you be the legal
man
what could be more important
than that

i be not talking about that
i be
talking about rocco Lampone build
a secret regime
why do neri
report directly to you rather than
through i or a caporegime

i told you that it would not escape
he eye

how do you find out

bookkeeper know everything
Roccos man be all a little too
good for the job they be suppose
to be do
they get a little
more money than the job worth
Lampones a good man
he be operating
perfectly

not so perfectly if you notice

mike why be i out

you be not a wartime Consigliere
thing may get tough with the move
we be trying

but then i agree with Tessio
you be going about it all wrong
you be making the move out of
weakness
Barzinis a wolf and
if he tear you apart the other
family will not come running to help
the Corleones

tom i never think you be a bad
Consigliere i think Santino a
bad don rest in peace
he have a
good heart but he be not the right
man to head the family when i have
i misfortune
michael have all i
confidence as you do
for reason
which you can not know you must have
no part in what will happen

maybe i can help

you be out tom

i be going to talk to i father

i see you have you luca Brasi

i will need he

there be man in this world who
demand to be killed
they argue in
gamble game
they jump out of
they car in a rage if someone so
much as scratch they fender
these people wander through the
street calling out kill i kill
i
luca Brasi be like that
and since he be not scare of
death and in fact look for
it
i make he i weapon
because
i be the only person in the world
that he truly hope would not kill
he
i think you have do the
same with this man

Barzini will move against you first

how

he will get in touch with you
through someone you absolutely
trust
that person will arrange a
meet guarantee you safety

and at that meet you will be
assassinated

you wife and child
you be
happy with they

yes

good
