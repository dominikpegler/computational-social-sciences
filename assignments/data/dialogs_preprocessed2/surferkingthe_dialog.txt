the first aid station when you said the

if you want to keep coming here every day
and driving that little convertible of
yours i need to see real concrete
change in you attitude

for one thing start mingle with the
commoner
you would be amaze at how nice
some of the people who work here be
make some friend outside that little
group of yours

of
Mahalo and aloha

OMai or you be mine

so
how be thing working out at
Aokees

oh he be great
alex too
i think
this summer be going to be a train
wreck but it be not turning out too bad

well of course this be not california

no but it look like i will get a chance
to do some surfing anyway

really

apparently there be some kind of surfing
contest and Aokee be all over i to
enter

you mean the surfer king

you have hear of it

it be all the other girl seem to talk
about
this be i first year but
of
apparently it be a pretty big deal
being
from oceanside you should have a good
chance

we will see
it seem kind of stupid to
i
surf contest in colorado
i friend back home would never believe
it

alex
get i twenty buck

oh dougie
you know i left i wallet
over in i locker
i will see you before
we leave and get it to you then

yeah sure

you know you could always come by
Aokees and i could give it to you in
trade

cash money alex
cash money

no problem
of

hey listen
alex told i about this
great spot on the other side of thunder
bay that look down on the party but
it be a little more quiet
want to go for
a walk

sure


so
what make you folk pick up from
beautiful southern california and move to
colorado

not both i folk
just i mom

he administrative assistant and now
they be both somewhere in mexico
mom
get a job here some of she family
here so they said Colorady be the place
you outta be

it could be bad

well i must admit i have meet some very
nice people
in california the attitude a little
different
here not everyone be out to
prove something
seem like everyone
just want to have fun

i have a theory
sometimes it snow here
so hard that it be a challenge just to
get to work or to school
everything
shut down for a day or so
if you car
get stick people appear from nowhere to
help pull you out and get you back on the
road
most people here do not just look
out for themselves
lot of time
of
they be looking out for you too



all these switch feed sound throughout
the park
which remind i

and this be for bad little girl who
do not know how to have fun

oops
there
almost get you



you be right
this be nice
but not necessarily quiet

just a sec

hey alex
give we break down here
turn down the sound effect



uh oh

Aokee you have be real good to i

then let i introduce you properly
robbie Zirpollo meet manuel ramirez

Manuels family snuck across the border
ten year ago through juarez mexico

i father refused to work for a drug lord
who run we town
they tried to kill
of
he
we barely get out with we live

Aokee

name i picked up reading an obituary in
the paper
i send away to hawaii and get
he birth record and social security
number
this way i never have to worry
about immigration
i spent week
watch tape of hawaii FiveO just to
get the accent right
book they Danno
huh
what be that all about

and you know

i burn i hand on the grill one day and
start swearing in spanish

and i said boy you speak spanish like a
native
uh oh
it be be we little
secret
now it be you secret too

i need to think about all this

you do

sleep tonight
sleep well

right
goodnight



of




have you see he

not yet

what you lookin at

we looking for you
how you sleep

i sleep fine
i decided i be not i father
i do not run
out on the people i care about just
because some blond shake she tatas at
i

we go then

she shake she tatas
no one said
anything about shaking tatas
this put a whole new light on thing

get going


of

alright here the deal
you get three
try
three heat
we judge each run
and only you high score count
if you
fall you get no score for the run
you
score will be added to the total for you
team and the winner get the surfer king
trophy
any question

then let we begin
ground be up first
of

clearing he throat
fluster
it look like we have a tie
this have
never happen before but i seem to
remember we provide for this possibility
in the rule
hopefully we judge can
help we figure out what to do

read from the rule
in the event
of a tie at the end of three heat in the
surf competition the team who be tied
will participate in a suddendeath surf
off
additional heat will be run until
a winner can be declared

the sudden death heat will begin in
five minute

you want to go first or second

second

be ready in five minute

of

so what you do
wait for he to go crazy
and fall

do not want to win with he falling

you could always go out and do you very
best take a lot of chance and maybe win
this thing on merit

do not be silly
that only work in the
movie

actually that be exactly what i be
think
it be the reason we be in a
tie
i have be too conservative
i have
get to do everything i can or just
forget about it
it be all or nothing
we get to pull the fin

pull da fin

you think you can hold it

one time these tourist from japan on
the beach at la jolla offered i a
hundred buck to do a full spin at the
top of the wave and then slide down and
cut back and do a full back flip
i
pulled it off
friend of mine have a
trick board with just a single fin and
foot pocket

we get to pull the fin
what do we do
about the foot pocket

you get duct tape

what kind of plumber would i be if i
do not have duct tape
water world
of
platinum
where do you want they

here and here

so help i understand
what you do now

Pipeman be taking the extra fin off i
board
i only need one to make a deep
cut back
he be also putting some
pocket to slip i foot into so when i
flip upside down i do not lose the board

flip upside down

back flip
you guy see it on
snowboarder here all the time i be sure

oh yeah i be sure i do that last winter
but not on purpose
dude
you be either
going to win this thing or you be going to die

it would be good if you win

yeah well a tie be like kiss you
sister

you stay away from i sister

ready

i will need the big wave you can give
i

imitate mr
scott on star
of
trek
i will give er all she be get Capn

robbie
when you do this do this mostly
for robbie Zirpollo
but do it just a
little bit for manny ramirez eh



look like he be waiting for you to make a
mistake
