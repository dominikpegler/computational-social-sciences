oh dear girl you
extracurricular activity be
of no consequence to i
i
do not give a damn who you
sleep with
i be concern
about david

yes sir


it be a full moon
where be
he

at i flat
i be off at
midnight and


the number alex
you
number









he be not there

he be not


alex have david persist in
he werewolf fantasy

well yes but he seem to be
more upset by the death of he
friend


have he friend appear to he
again

yes


what do he say

david say jack come to warn
he


warn he

dr
hirsch what be wrong
be
this more serious than i know


i tried to investigate the
attack
there be no record
the case be closed and now
they have misplaced the file
davids laceration be
cleaned and dressed when he
arrive here and yet
supposedly no doctor examine
he before i do
the goodman
boy be already in the ground
so he be no good to we
so i
go to the pub in east
proctor where i be convince
of two thing

yes


they be lying
there be
no witness no escaped
lunatic
the whole community
be hide the truth of what
actually happen up there

and what else


i think the village of east
proctor be hide some dark
and terrible secret
i be
convinced that like david
they believe in this werewolf


you have absolutely no idea
where david might be

no
he know no one in
london besides i
i
should not have left he alone

surely you be not
suggest


david have suffer a severe
trauma
i myself witness
some form of mass neurosis in
east proctor
if all the
villager believe that jack
goodman be killed by a
werewolf why should not david
and then it follow that if he
survive an attack by a
werewolf would not he himself
become a werewolf the next
full moon

dr
hirsch


oh i do not mean running about
on all fours and howling at
the moon
