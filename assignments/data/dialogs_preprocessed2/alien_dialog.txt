oh
god
be i cold

be that you roby

i feel like shit

yeah it be you all right

ohh
i must be alive i feel dead

you look dead

the vampire rise from they grave

shake he fist in the
air triumphantly
we make it

be it over

it be over hunter

boy that be terrific

well how do it feel to be rich
man

cold

okay
everybody topside
let we get
we pants on and get to we post

somebody get the cat


i be going to buy a cattle ranch

cattle ranch

i be not kidding
you can get one if
you have the credit
look just like
real cow too

all right tycoon let we stop
spending we credit and start
worrying about the job at hand

right
fire up all system

sandy you want to give we some
vision

feast you eye

where be Irth

sandy scan the whole sky



where be we

sandy contact traffic control

this be deep space commercial vessel
registration number
calling antarctica air traffic
control
do you read i
over

i do not recognize that constellation

dell plot we location

i get it
oh boy

where the hell be we

just short of zeta reticuli
we
have not even reach the outer rim
yet

what the hell

this be chaz speaking
sorry but we
be not home
we present location
seem to be only halfway to Irth
remain at you post and stand by
that be all

chaz i have get something here on i
security alert
high priority from
the computer

let we hear it

computer you have signal a
priority three message
what be the
message

i have interrupt the course of the
voyage

what
why

i be programme to do so if certain
condition arise

computer this be captain standard
what condition be you talking
about

i have intercepted a transmission of
unknown origin

transmission

voice transmission

out here

i have recorded the transmission

play it for we please



the bizarre voice speak a long sentence then fall

computer what language be that

unknown

unknown
what do you mean

it be none of the dialect
spoken by technological man

just
hold it

hold it
computer
have you attempted to
analyze the transmission

yes
there be two point of salient
interest
number one
it be highly
systematize indicate intelligent
origin
number two
certain sound
be inconsistent with the human
palate

oh i god

well it be finally happen

first contact

sandy can you home in on that beam

what be the frequency

computer what be the frequency of
the transmission

dash

i have get it
it be coming from
ascension minute second
declination degree second

dell show i that on a screen

i will give it to you on number four

that be it
let i straighten it out

can you get it a little close

that be what i be going to do

planetoid
diameter kilometer

it be tiny

any rotation

yeah
two hour

gravity

point eight six
we can walk on it

martin get the other up to the
lounge


if it be an


we be morally
obligate to investigate

right

i do not know
seem to i we come on
this trip to make some credit not
to go off on some kind of side trip

forget the credit
what we have here
be a chance to be the
first man
to
contact a
nonhuman intelligence

if there be some kind of alien
intelligence down on that planetoid
it would be a serious mistake for we to
blunder in unequipped

hell we be equip

hell no
we do not know what be down
there on that piece of rock
it
might be dangerous
what we should
do be get on the radio to the
exploration authority
and let
they deal with it

except it will take year to get
a reply back
do not forget how far
we be from the colony martin

there be no commercial lane out
here
face it we be out of range

man have wait century to contact
another form of intelligent life in
the universe
this be an opportunity
which may never come again

look

you be overrule martin
gentleman
let we go


dell i want great magnification
more surface detail
i want to see
what this place look like

i will see what i can do

it be out of focus

no that be atmosphere
cloud
layer

i god it be stormy for a piece of
rock that size

just a second
those be not water vapor cloud
they have no moisture content

put ship in atmospheric mode



dell set a course and bring we in
on that beam



activate lifter quad

activate
vertical drop check
correct course
on tangential
course now orbit
brief pause as he
study he instrument
crossing the terminator
enter
night side



atmospheric turbulence
dust storm

turn on navigation light



approaching point of origin
closing
at kilometer and slow
ten
five
gentleman we be
directly above the source of the
transmission

what be the terrain down there

well line of sight be impossible
due to dust
radar give i noise
sonar give i noise
infrared
noise
let we try ultraviolet
there
flat
it be totally flat
plain

be it solid

it be
basalt
rock

then take she down

drop begin
now
fifteen
kilometer and dropping
twelve
ten
eight and slow
five
three
two
one kilometer and
slow
lock tractor beam

lock

kill drive engine

engine off

nine hundred meter and dropping


hang on gentleman



and we be
down



jesus christ

what the hell happen

engine room what happen

just a minute hold it i be
checking

have the hull be breached

uh
no i do not see anything
we have
still get pressure

martin this be jay
the intake be
clogged with dust
we overheated and
burned out a whole cell

damn it
how long to fix

how long to fix

hard to say

well get start

right
talk to you

let we take a look outside
turn the
screen back on

can not see a bless thing



kick on the flood



not much help

well we can not go anywhere in this
darkness
how long till dawn

well
this rock rotate every two
hour
the sun should be coming up
in about minute

good
maybe we will be able to see
something then

or something will be able to see we





there could be a whole city out
there and we would never see it

not sitting on we butt in here
that be for sure

just settle down
sandy you get any
response yet

sorry
nothing but that same damn
transmission every second
i have
tried every frequency on the
spectrum

be we just going to sit around and
wait for an invitation

hello faust

yeah

how be it coming on the engine


i never see anything as fine as this
dust
these cell be all pitted on
a microscopic level
i have to
polish these thing smooth again so
it be going to take a while
okay


yeah okay

sandy
how far be we from the
source of the transmission

source of transmission be to the
northeast
about meter

close

close enough to walk to

martin would you run i an
atmospheric

punch button and
consult he panel
argon nitrogen neon
and some trace element

Nontoxic
but unbreathable
pressure

ten to the fourth dyne per square
centimeter

good
moisture content

zero
dry as a bone

any microorganism

not a one
it be dead

anything else

yeah rock particle
dust

well we will not need pressure suit
but breathe mask be called for
sandy can you rig up some kind of
portable unit that we can use to
follow that transmission to it
source

no problem

i volunteer for the exploration
party

i hear you
you want to break out
the side arm


adjust the radio on his
mask
i be sending
do you hear i

receive

receive

all right
now just remember
keep
away from those weapon unless i say
otherwise
martin do you read i


read you chaz


open the outer door


which way sandy

that way

you lead

okay martin
we be on we way


okay chaz i hear you
i have get you
on i board

good
i be get you clear too
let we just keep the line open


can not see more than three meter in
any direction out here
we be
walking blind on instrument

what be wrong

i signal fade


it be the dust it be interfering

hold it i have get it again
it be
over that way

what be happening

hell


it be close real close

how far

we should be almost on top of it
i
just can not quite

martin uh we have find it

find what

it appear to be some sort of
spacecraft
we be going to approach
it


there be no sign of life
no
light
no movement

we be uh approaching the base


appear to be a door hanging open
the entrance be clogged with debris

look like a derelict

martin we be going in
i be going to
hold the conversation to a minimum
from here on


air lock

who know

let we try and find the control room

look at these hole
this place
look like swiss cheese

this hole go up several deck
look like somebody be firing a
military disintegrator in here

climb gear

i will go first

no you will follow i


holy christ

look at this

something have be scratch here
into the veneer
see



keep away from that gun

just machinery

but function

that be where the transmission be
coming from

recording
damned automatic
recording



this be the control room

some detail of the control
room

this be the skeleton
another
view of the skeleton
the
transmitting device

this be a closeup of the triangle
we find scrawl on the console in
front of the skeleton

and that be it

phenomenal
staggering

we have get to go back and take a lot
more picture holograph
everything

and bring back as much physical
evidence as possible too
the rest
of the skeleton
some of the
machinery
write record if there
be any

martin

i agree
this be the single most
important discovery in history

but

what killed it

hell that thing be dead for
year
maybe hundreds of year
the
whole planet dead

the way i figure it they landed
here for repair or something then
they could not take off again
maybe
the dust ruined they engine
they
set up an


beacon but nobody
come
so they die

he
die

what

not
they
he

there be only one skeleton

jay
how be it coming on the
repair

well
i be going to have to blow the
engine out

and when will you be ready to do
that

oh i be not near ready yet

then why the hell be you sitting
around here

right

and there sit mane first contact
with intelligent life in the
universe



you ready up there


sure we be ready


okay
i be going to start the
extraction procedure now


alas poor yorick

find anything we missed

i do not even know what i be looking
for

still worry

oh well
you know i

i have always respected you opinion
martin
if something worry you it
worry i

what would you say that be suppose
to mean

well
it be obviously intentional
some kind of attempt at
communication
maybe it be a symbol
that mean something to they

but why draw it on the wall

picking a hair out of
the coffeepot
this ship be full of cat hair

tell you what martin
as soon as
the engine fixed

this be chaz

chaz this be dell
can you come
topside for a minute

what be up

well the sun just come up again
and it seem the windas die down
it be as clear as a bell outside
there be something i think you ought
to see

i be on i way


what be it

take a look



i be scanning the horizon to see
what i could pick up
look there on
that screen

what be it i can not

this be chaz
all hand topside
now


do not seem much doubt about it
do there

that creature sure must have
considered it important
use he
last strength to draw it

maybe they build it

as what

marker for bury instrumentation

or a mass grave

maybe the rest of the crew be in
there in some kind of suspend
animation waiting to be rescue

it be not necessarily build by they

here come the dust again



well do anyone else agree with
martin that we should
not
explore
it

then the sooner we get moving the
well


we can not make out any detail or
feature yet
but it be definitely
too regular for a natural
formation


there be one thing i can say for
sure though

now what be wrong

i have completely lost they signal

can you get they back

i be trying


this look ancient

can not tell these weather
condition could erode anything
fast

there be no entrance

maybe the entrance be buried
could
be under we foot

maybe there
be
no entrance
the
thing may be solid


well there ought to be some way we
can get through to they

sorry to interrupt but i be going to
charge up the engine for a minute
okay

yeah okay
go ahead

yes

i have a temporary sequence on the
monitor

hold it i can not hear a damn thing

go ahead

you mean
you have translate it

well come on come on
what do it
say

what
what be that

the computer just translate the
goddamn message
it be not an


it be a warn


maybe we can get in by the top

you want to try

sure

you guy just wait down here till i
say it be okay to come up


there be a hole at the top


can we come up

no it be too small only room enough
for one person

can you see anything in the hole


i can see
partway down
it just
go down like a stovepipe
smooth
wall
i can not see the bottom
light will not reach


yes
what be it

jay we have get a problem
i be
wonder if there be any way you
could shortcut the repair and give
we immediate takeoff capability

why what be wrong

the computer translated the alien
signal and it be kind of alarm

what do you mean

it could not translate the whole
thing only three phrase
i will just
read it to you the way i get it






and that be all it could translate


dell you want to come down we can
figure out where to go from here

no i want to go in


okay dell but just for a
preliminary lookaround
do not
unhook yourself from you cable
and
be out in less than ten minute


right

okay i be in the mouth of the
chimney now and i be starting down

take care


it be noticeably warm in here
warm
air rising from below

be you okay in there

yeah i be okay
have not hit bottom
yet
definitely a column of warm air
rise
it keep the shaft clear of
dust

what be that dell i lost you do
you read i

yeah but this be hard work
can not
talk now

i be way below ground level


Whatd he say

i could not make it out too much
interference


i be get nowhere
the whole area
around the pyramid be dead to
transmission
i think we should go
after they

no

what do you mean no

we be not going anywhere

but they do not know about the
translation
they could be in danger
right now

we can not spare the personnel
we have
get minimum takeoff capability right
now
that be why chaz left we on
board

why you chickenshit bastard

just can that crap
i be in command
here till chaz return
and nobody
leaving this ship


tunnel go cave or something
below i feel like the tropics
in here
air be warm and humid
high oxygen content no dust
it be completely breathable


it be unbelievable
it be like some
kind of tomb
some primitive
religion
hey be anybody there
do
you read i
standard


if we do not hear from he soon i
think we well go in after he

sun will be down in a minute


i do not know if you can hear i but
the place be full of large bottle
or jar just like the one we find
on the other ship except these
be all sealed
also they be soft to
the touch

another funny thing i just put i
hand on it and now there be these
raise area appear where i
fingertip be


let we go



here he line
we can haul he out
of there if we have to

it will yank he right off he foot if
he be not expect it
the line
could get tangle in something

but what can we do
he be out of
radio contact

maybe we should just wait a few more
minute

no i told he to be out in ten
minute
it be be much longer
let we get he out of there

the lineas slack
christ do you
think the idiot unhook himself

there it caught

be it still coming up or be it
hook on something

no it be coming

can you see anything

no i can not see far enough
the
lineas moving though

i can see he
here he come

get ready to grab he

look out
there be something on
he face

what be it

do not touch he watch it

oh god oh god no

help i i be going to try to get
it off

it will not come it be stick

what be it

how the hell should i know
come on
give i a hand let we get he out of
there


i have get they
they be back on i
screen

how many

three blip
they be coming this
way

hey can you guy hear i

yeah we hear you
we be coming
back

thank christ
we lost you
listen
there be be a new development

can not talk now
Broussards injured
we will need some help get he
into the ship

oh no

jay this be cleave
meet i at the
main air lock


martin i be by the inner lock door
i will wait here for you to let they
in


right


what the hello going on

do not know broussard get hurt
somehow

hurt
how

do not know maybe we will be real
lucky and he just broke he neck
i know we should not of come down
here


martin be you there

here chaz

we be coming up now open the outer
lock door

chaz what happen to broussard

it be some kind of organism it be
attached itself to he
let we in

you hear i martin
open the outer
door

chaz if it be an organism and we
let it in the ship will be
infect

we can not leave he out here open
the door

chaz listen to i we have broken
every rule of quarantine
if we
bring an organism on board we will not
have a single layer of defense left

martin this be an order
open the
door


outer door open

you man stay clear there be a
parasite on he

oh god oh

be it alive

i do not know but do not touch it
give we a hand here let we get he
up to the autodoc


help i come on let we get he up
here

that thing god almighty do not you
try to get it off he

it would not come

medical glove

it be really on there tight

here let i try

stop it you be tearing he face

it be not coming off not without
he whole face coming off too

let we let the machine work on he

hey now what be this

ask he

slowly put he hand
to he cheek
i understand why you do that

good

he would not open the lock
he be
going to leave we out there

yeah
well maybe he should have
i
mean you bring the goddamn thing
in here
maybe
you
deserve to get
slap

excuse i i have get work to do

i keep i mouth pretty much shut
but i do not like hitting

i guess i have it coming
let we call
it settled

would somebody fill i in

he go into the pyramid alone
we
lose radio contact with he
when we
pulled he out it be on he face
it will not come off not without
injure he

where do it come from

he be
the only one that know that

how do he breathe

blood thoroughly oxygenated

yeah but how
he nose and mouth
be blocked

let we look inside he head

look at that

what be it i can not tell
anything

it be some kind of organ it be
insert some kind of tube or
something down he throat

oh
god

i think that be how it be get
oxygen to he

it do not make any sense
it
paralyzes he
put he into a
coma
then keep he alive

we can not expect to understand a life
form like this
we be out of we
back yard
thing be different
here

well can not we kill it
i mean we
can not leave the damn thing on he

we do not know what might happen if
we tried to kill it
at least right
now it be keeping he alive

how about cutting it off
we can not
pull it loose but we can cut off
everything but the bottom layer
where it be stick to he face

you be right
we can not stand here
and do nothing

somebody give i a scalpel

i have make an incision
it be not
react
but some kind of
yellowish fluid be leak out of
the wound

hold it this stuff smoke

god that smoke poisonous

it be eating a hole in the floor


that stuff eating right through
the metal
it be going to eat through
the deck and right out through the
hull


there
look

jesus what can we put under it


there
should be coming through
about there

careful do not get under it


christ that stink

seem to have stopped penetrate

what be happening up here

i think it be fizzle out

i never see anything like that in i
life
except molecular acid

but this thing use it for
blood

hell of a defense mechanism
you
do not dare kill it

it be stopped

yes thank heaven

we be just plain lucky
that could
have go right through the hull
taken
week
to patch it

remind i of when i be a kid and
the roof leak everybody running
for the pot and pan

i god what about broussard


do it get on he

no thank god
just missed he

be it still drip

it appear to have heal itself

it make i sick to see he like
that

be not there some way we can get it
off he

i do not see how
but let we do what
we can for he

i think we would well get some
intravenous feeding start
god
know what that thing be leach
out of he

look there what be that stain on his
lung

it appear to be a heavy fluid of
some sort
it block the xray

that tube must be deposit it in
he

could be some kind of venom or
poison

this be horrible

hey
what about the film

what film

broussard have film in he datastick
do not he
we can see what happen
to he


that must have be when he get it

the same thing must have happen to
the creature on the other ship
except they take one of those jar
on board and opened it there

click back through the
slide to a picture of
one of the urn
at first i think they be jar
too or artifact anyway
but
they be not
they be egg or spore
casing
let we go back to the
heiroglyphics

i personally can not make any sense
out of it

it be a crude symbolic language
look primitive

you can not tell that kind of stuff
could represent print circuit

that sound a little fanciful

primitive pictorial language be
base on common object in the
environment and this can be used as
a start point for translation

what common object

listen have not somebody well check
on broussard

i will do it
the rest of you
continue

i will come with you


you know it be fantastic the
human race have go this long
without ever encounter another
advance life form and now we run
into a veritable zoo

what do you mean

well those thing out there be not
the same you know the spaceship
and the pyramid
they be from
different culture and different
race
that ship just landed here
crashed like we do
the pyramid and
the thing from it be indigenous

how could anything be indigenous to
this asteroid
it be dead

maybe it be not always dead


it be go

now we be in for it

the door be closed
it must still
be in here

no do not open the door
we do not
want it escaping

well what the hell good can we do
in here
we can not grab it it
might jump on we

maybe we can catch it

as long as we be careful not to
damage it

shit

i think it be dead


look at these sucker no wonder
we could not get it off he

be that it mouth

more likely that organ the tube
like thing fit up in there

ugh

quick it be decompose give i
something to grab it with

christ
let we get it out of here



for chrissake open the main lock




slump against the
wall
i god it be lethal even when it be
dead


over intercom
filter
yes

how be broussard

he be running a fever

still unconscious

yes

can you do anything for he

the machine will bring his
temperature down
he vital
function be strong

good

i need some coffee


these day and night cycle be
totally disorienting
i feel like
we have be here for day but it be
only be how long

about four hour

stare into he coffee
cup
i be sorry to say it look like you
be right in the first place
martin
we never should have landed
here

look i be not trying to rub
anybodies nose in anything
the
important thing be just to get away
from here as fast as possible

i can not lean on faust any hard
he be be working nonstop on the
engine

if we know exactly what happen to
the being on the other ship

we do know that

yeah

they never make it off the planet
the parasite win

where do the parasite come from

they seem native to the planet
it be
get an atmosphere and a dense
gravity
it be dead now but once it
must have be fertile

no
it be just too small to support
fauna as big as the parasite
if
there be a native ecology it
would have to be microscopic

could not the pyramid have be build
here by space traveller

too primitive
it be a pre
technological construction
that
slab be engineered by an IronAge
culture at best

they be from a dead civilization
they be spore from a tomb
god
know how long they have be here

i think we well take another look
at those heiroglyphs

hey guess what

what

the engine be fixed



switch on tractor beam

lock tractor beam

retract land strut



take we up

up one kilometer jay



switch on lifter quad



engage artificial gravity

engaged

let we take she into an escape orbit

i be alter we vector now
should
give we an easy escape velocity

what be that

this dust be get clogged in the
intake again

just hold we together till we be in
space that be all






we make it
damn we make it

you bet we make it
martin set
course for Irth and accelerate we
into stardrive

with great pleasure

i feel like an escapee from hell




that be the part that always make i
feel like i be going to puke when we
accelerate into light speed

quit complaining
we be in space


i think the good thing to do with
broussard be to just freeze he as
he be
it will arrest the progress of
he disease and he can get complete
medical attention when we get back
to the colony

we will have to go into quarantine
maybe for quite a while

that be okay he can remain in
hypersleep until they be ready to
treat he


mouth so dry
can i have some
water

more

how do you feel dell

wretched
what happen to i

do not you remember

do not remember nothing
can not hardly
remember i name

be you in pain

not exactly just feel like
somebody be beating i with
rubber hose for about six year

hell you be in great shape you have
get you sense of humor back

god i be hungry

dell what be the last thing you can
remember

i do not know

do you remember the pyramid

no
just some horrible dream about
smother
where be we

we be going home
we be in
hyperspace

we be going into the freezer now

i be really starve
can we get some
food before we go into the freezer

i think that be a pretty reasonable
request


boy do i feel a lot well
it be a
straight shoot back to the colony
and then we can start taking bid on
the paydirt
any bet on the top
bid

well we should at least be able to
each buy we own planet

i be going to write a book about this
expedition
i be going to call it
the snark log


the commander normally have first
publication right

maybe we could write it together

first thing i be going to do when we
get back be eat some biological
food

what be the matter you do not like
this stuff

taste like something you would feed a
chicken to make it lay more egg

oh it be okay
i have have good cag
than this but i have have bad too
if you know what i mean

i kind of like it

you like this shit

it grow on you

you know what they make this stuff
out of

yes i know what they make it out
of so what
it be food now
you be
eating it

i do not say it be bad for you
it be just kind of sickening that be
all

do we have to talk about this kind
of crap at the dinner table

what be wrong

i do not know
i be get these


breathe deeply



what
dell
what

OhmygooaaAA


oh no
oh no

what be that
what the christ be
that

it be growing in he the whole time
and he do not even know it

that thing used he for an
incubator



we can not go into hypersleep with
that thing running around loose

we would be sitting duck in the
freezer

but we can not kill it
if we kill it
it will spill all it body acid
right through we hull and out into
space

shit

we will have to catch it and eject it
from the ship

well i kind of hate to point it
out but all we supply be base
on we spending a strictly limit
amount of time out of suspend
animation
and as you know we used
up most of that time in harvest

we have get about a week left right

and then we run out of food and
oxygen

the water will still recycle

we will not need it then

all right so that be what we have get
week
it be plenty of time

but if we
have not
caught it in a
week then we have to go into the
freezer anyway


so do anybody have any
suggestion

we could put on we pressure suit
and blow all the air out of the
ship
that would kill it

no we can not afford to lose that
much oxygen
we be going to have to
flush it out

how

room by room corridor by corridor

and what do we do when we find it

we will have to trap it somehow
if we
have a really strong piece of net we
could bag it

we could cut a section out of that
metallite net
it will not hold up
to that acid but aside from that
it be pretty strong

we have to avoid injure it
what
we really need be some electric
animal prod

i think i could cobble something
together
long metal rod with a
battery in it
give it a hell of a
shock

good
get on it
but first i be
issue a stand order
from this
moment forth every one of we will
wear protective garment including
helmet
let we get down to the
locker and change




i think i would find you here

i be think of a line from an old
poem
water water everywhere but
not a drop to drink
all that space
out there and we be trapped in this
ship

that be the one about the albatross
right

we can not even radio for help
the
carrier wave would not reach it
destination till long after we would
die and turned to dust
we be
utterly absolutely alone
can
anybody really visualize such a
scale of distance
halfway across
creation

we come out there we will go back

long time by the clock but a short
time to we

time and space have no meaning out
here
we be living in einsteinian
equation

i can see you be putting you spare
time to good use
lean forward and tap
he on the knee
let i tell you something
you keep
stare at hyperspace for long
enough they will be peeling you off a
wall
i have see it happen

we be the new pioneer chaz
we
even have we own special disease

come on let we go above and see
how they be coming with the gear


these have portable generator in
they
they be insulated down to here
just be careful not to touch the
end

might even incinerate the damn
thing

i hope not

do not worry it will not damage it
it will just give it a little
incentive

how do we locate the creature

with these

tracking device
you set it to
search for a moving object
it
have not get much range but when you
get within a certain distance it
start beeping

these will be very useful
at least
we will not have to go digging around
in closet with we bare hand
all
right here the battle plan
we be
going to break into two team and
start systematically covering the
ship
whoever find it first
catch it in the net and eject it
from the near airlock
clear

even simple

for starter let we make sure the
bridge be safe

it be clear

all right roby and Melkonis will
go with faust
hunter and i will
make up the second team

we will all carry communicator
we
want to keep in constant touch


nothing yet
nothing
we can move
pretty fast as long as there be
nothing on the tracker



hold it

i have get something

where be it coming from

peer closely at tracker
and frown
machine screw up i can not tell
needle spinning all over the dial

be it malfunction

no just confuse
it be coming from
below we


okay

looking at tracker and
nodding down the passageway
that way

what happen to the light

bulb burned out nobody bothered to
replace they

hold it

it be within meter

oh hold it

we be making fool of ourselves

yes

we have get it up here
it be trapped
get up here fast

where be you

Foodstorage room

we be coming



we see it inside and slam the
door on it
it be in there now

what be it do have a seizure

it start crashing around right
after we locked it in

now what

i guess we open the door and net it

i hate to open that door

it look completely different from
the first one it be more like a
worm with leg
and tentacle

well we well do something

maybe we do not have to
it be trapped
in there
we could just leave it in
there all the way back to Irth

do not be an idiot

i know what we can do
we can pump
poison gas into the room and kill
it
through those ventilator slot
there

hey wait a minute
that be all we
food supply in there
we can not
pump poison gas all over they

once we kill the thing we will not need
the food any more we can go
straight into hypersleep
also it
sound like that thing be already
do a pretty good job on we
supply
it may be foul they
all

you win

somebody give i a hand i will get the
stuff


get those mask on

this stuff deadly i hope we
know what we be do

go ahead jay

shut it off

now what

what do you think
now we go in


look like he helped himself

god damn it

it escaped

where do that go

all over the ship
we will have to
check the chart to know for sure

then let we go and do it

have we get any food at all left in
the ship


that one section of the ventilator
shaft have only two outlet you
notice
the food storage room on one
end

and the cool unit on the
other

so it be trapped in between now we
have to drive it out

poison gas

we can not pump poison gas down into
the cool unit
it will flood the
whole ship

the only other thing i can think of
be for somebody to crawl in there
and flush it out

be you
crazy

the man would need protection
obviously as well as some way to
drive the thing before he

how about a flamethrower
that
would not poison the air

so one of we go into the airshaft
and drive the thing along

while the rest of we wait down in
the cool unit with the net

sound like a rough one

get a good idea

so the only question left be
who
get to crawl down the airshaft

let we be democratic

martin take one

open it up cleave


well uh
good luck
i hope you
will not need i but if you do i am
here

right


hey do you guy read i down there


yeah we be get into position


okay i be starting now


there
that be where it be get to come
out

that be a flipflop gate to channel
the air but we can use it to trap
the thing

right now let we keep it close

i have get hunter
and something else
as well in front of he

be they close

they be on the next level up

let we get moving with this net



they be get pretty close now

all right then when it get to
the other side of the door you sing
out then drop the door
okay

okay

and you and i will bag it and then
we will take it to the ventral air
lock get it

Uhhuh


hey you guy


yes


i do not think this shaft go on too
much farther
anyway it be get
pretty hot in here


okay we screen show you as be
near to the open
we will open it
up then we will cue you and you can
start blast
Thatll drive it
right out
you do not have to go any
farther


good


okay get ready

open the vent sandy


what happen
where be it

how do it get so
big

by eating we food supply

where be Melkonis


hey be you guy still there
what be going on

meet we on the bridge
be careful
it be
huge
now

right


you mean he body be still kicking
when it run off with he

it be horrible horrible
like a
chicken


what happen
where be sandy

dead

dead

it be monstrous it grow like some
horrible tapeworm
we be
completely unprepared

it be still in the ship

we would well seal off the low
maintenance level
at least trap it
there
throw a switch
circuitry light up

at least it can not get up here now

two down four to go

what be that suppose to mean

nothing

listen it sure do not like this
flamethrower

that be right we can not kill it on
the ship but we can at least keep
it at bay and maybe drive it into
the air lock

thing be i be about out of fuel

there be some more combustible fuel
down in the storage locker next to
the lounge
i will go get it

no i do not want we separated

you just sealed it off
it can not get
to that section

do not count on it

we sure need this flamethrower

all right
but do
not
go below
deck

right

and be right back
faust exit

i think it be time we take a hard
look at those heiroglyphs

can you make out any pattern in all
that

well
yes
there be a pattern
but
it be meaningless to i

i know it look like a senseless
jumble but if you look closely
there be recognizable form

recognizable
in that

in symbolic form
very stylize
but if you stare at it you can see
some of the different creature
we have be dealing with

well
i suppose that starshaped
thing could be the parasite that get
on broussard
be that what you mean

and right next to it that oval
design with the marking it be a
dead ringer for the spore casing

that next thing there six leg
tentacle that be the thing we see
in the food locker

so the next step should be

the big one
and there it be

this be all the same creature
we be
seeing the different stage in it
lifecycle

then that tomb
must have be some
kind of fertility temple
where
they stored they egg and maybe
hold mate ritual

and broussard get catch in they
reproductive cycle

you will notice though that there
be no more phase
only four form
be show
after that the pattern
repeat

which presumably mean

more spore coming




it be in the lock blow the main
lock


what


it be in the main air lock
blow the
lock















how much oxygen do we lose

we have get six hour left

oh i god

do anybody know what happen

i see it
faust get himself jammed
in the air lock door
he body held
it open

can we get to he

no i have to seal off a whole
section
we would lose too much of we
remain air if we opened the
connect door



poor kitty
puss puss puss

at least we be rid of the damn
monster
it must have be the first
thing suck out of the ship

no such luck
i see it running down
one of the corridor

oh no
we can not fight this thing
there be only six hour of air left
we be dead man

i do not buy that
there be still time
to destroy it and get ourselves in
the freezer

how

it be time for drastic remedy

it be time for that a couple day
ago

that kind of remark be pointless
now come on i want to hear every
suggestion you can come up with no
matter how wild

we can not kill it on board
it be huge
now and must have tremendous amount
of that acid in it body

i have get an idea but you be not
going to like it

let we hear it

okay
first we shut down all the
cool system on the stardrive
engine

Thatll blow the ship up

right
but it will take a few minute
for the engine to overheat and melt
down the core
in the meantime we
get in the lifeboat and leave the
ship

blow the ship up

and the creature with it
we can
make it back to Irth in the
lifeboat

but the lifeboat can not accelerate to
light speed

do not matter we be already at
light speed
and when we get back to
the colony they will pick we up in
the network

what about all the mineral and
element in the cargo hold
that be
the only reason we come out here
we would have to abandon they all
we would
be broke

we live be more important
anyway we can take a small amount
of the most valuable stuff with we
on the lifeboat

no it will not work and i just
realized why
there be only one
hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat
only one of we could survive

yeah
i forget

but the idea good if we could
just turn it around somehow

if we could just get the
creature
into the lifeboat we could launch
it into space and blow it up

good
that be good

we can load the lifeboat up with
explosive and trigger they
remotely once the lifeboat be in
space

i think it be going to be almost
impossible to drive it up into the
lifeboat

we can use the flamethrower

it be not going to work

you can not say that
i think it be a
good plan

the flamethrower need more fuel

right
we have get a lot to
accomplish
let we get moving


which explosive should we use

i would suggest the stick
they be
portable and they can be radio
detonate

you know it be funny this stuff
we go to so much trouble to dig up
this treasure the paydirt
it will make it back to Irth just fine
even if we be not with it

here carry these

hey watch it

it be stable
it do not hurt to drop
it


hold it

up there

so what do we do
do we ignore it
and finish loading the explosive
into the boat or do we flush it
out now

now
if we can get it into the boat
we will not have to blow it up we
can just eject it into space



you can come up
it be safe

oh jesus

the ship gravitational attraction
must have draw he back

should we go outside and bring he
in

no
the risk be too great
perhaps
after we have destroyed the thing



along the base of the wall there

this should do it

i should hope so
and we would well
make sure it be pretty far from the
ship when we blow it

it will be

what we really need be some red meat
in here for bait

well if we have some i would eat it
i be starting to get hungry


well
now we have to herd that
thing up here

Whoevers do the herd be going to
have they hand pretty full
i
think somebody should stay by the
