materialize
look
look at what the
other side be going to run at we
they
get the company book prepared by
youcooked by youthat be motive
they get a murder scene you have
access to
that be opportunity
they
get that little trim thing he be
stabbed in the throat witha dame
weapon

it be big daves

do not interrupt methat be means
they get a fine upstanding pillar of
the business community as a victim
and then they get you a disgruntled
numberjuggling underling who on the
day in question be drunk as a skunk
and whose alibi for the time in
question be be passed out at home
alone

i be with she

like i say it stink

we forget the blackmail
you

how do you get into the store

i take Doriss key

will anyone say they see you there
on you way there
in there
on you
be back

i do not think so

will anyone corroborate and goddamn
part of you story at all

come on people
you can not help
each other like that
let we be
realistic now
let we look at we
option
well frankly i do not see
any option

i cannot present story

i cannot present story
i could
plead you for a nutcase but you look
too composed
i could offer a guilty
plea and in return they do not give
you the juice but i do not think you
want to spend the rest of you life
in chino and i know you do not hire
freddy Riedenschneider to hold you
hand at a sentence hear
hell
you could have get lloyd garroway
for that
no we be not giving up
yet
you hired freddy Riedenschneider
it mean you be not throwing in
the towel
i litigate i do not
capitulate
all right no option
we get to think
all right we go
back to the blackmail thing
it
titillate it be open end

and it make he the bad guy
you dig around you never know
something unsavory from he past he
approach you to help with the money
it be too late he past come back
to haunt he who be to say

yeah

forget the jealous
husband thing that be silly
we be
going with the blackmail
i will be in
touch



of course there be one person
who could confirm Doriss story or
plenty of it
the drycleaning
pansy



but he would left the hotel skip
out on he bill



he would also disappeared from the
residence he give i



owing two month rent
how could
i have be so stupid
hand over

for a piece of paper
and
the man go
like a ghost



disappeared into thin air
vaporize like the nip at nagasaki
go now
all go
the money go
big dave go
doris going
how could
i have be so stupid

she make this stuff she call it
gatto it be get egg in there it be
get sugar it be gotit be cake
basically except she call it gatto
like if you do not call it cake maybe
you will not put on any weight like i
need to eat gatto you know what i be
saying
this stuff if i have have a
square meal i have have i steak and
potato i can just have another
cup of coffee afterward i will not ask
for the desert if it be not there



sooner or later everyone need a
haircut

get the recipe from a magazine
woman magazine



we be working for the bank now
we
keep cutting the hair trying to
stay afloat make the payment tread
water day by day day by day



most people think someone accuse
of a crime they haul they in and
bring they to trial but it be not
like that it be not that fast
the
wheel of justice turn slow

do willfully and with malice
aforethought take the life of one
david allen brewster a human being



they have an arraignment and then
the indictment and they entertain
motion to dismiss and postpone
and change the venue and alter this
and that and the other
they empanel
a jury which bring more motion
and they set a trial date and then
change the date and then often as
not they will change it again

what say you to these charge

we plead not guilty you honor



and through all of it we cut the
hair

i say honey if you be going to make a
cobbler make a little bit of cobbler
do not put a whole pan in front of i
and tell i it be not going to be any
good when it be cold



meanwhile freddy Riedenschneider
sleep at the metropole



and shoveled it in at DaVincis



he would bring in a private investigator
from sacramento



to nose around into big daves
past



i find myself more and more going
over to the Abundass
it be a
routine we fell into most every
evening
i even go when walter be
away on he research trip
he be a
genealogist have trace back he
side of the family seven generation
he late wife eight
it seem
like a screwy hobby
but then maybe
all hobby be
maybe walter find
something there in the old county
courthouse hospital file room
city archive property roll
registry something maybe like
what i find listening to birdy play
some kind of escape
some kind of
peace

lo honey

they get this guy in germany
fritz somethingorother
or be it
maybe it be werner
anyway he be get
this theory you want to test something
you know scientificallyhow the
planet go round the sun what
sunspot be make of why the water
come out of the tapwell you get to
look at it
but sometimes you look
at it you look change it
ya
can not know the reality of what
happen or what would have happen
if you hadden a stick in you goddamn
schnozz
so there be no what
happen
not in any sense that we
can grasp with we puny mind
because
we mind
out mind get in the
way
look at something change
it
they call it the uncertainty
principle
sure it sound screwy
but even einstein say the guy on
to something

science
perception
reality
doubt

reasonable doubt
i be sayin
sometimes the more you look the
less you really know
it be a fact

prove fact
in a way it be the only
fact there be
this heinie even write
it out in number

burns

subject
david allen brewster
born
cincinnati
father
insurance
salesman
mother
homemaker
one
year case western university on
football scholarship
Flunks out

retail appliance salesman in
Barnhoffs department store
cincinnati

meet ann
Nirdlinger married later that year
move here

arrested on an
assault complaint
complainant an
organizer for the have a break
nose couple of rib wife family
intercede some kind of settlement
charge drop

another assault
beef bar altercation

yeah yeah couple of fistfight
go
to he service record

induct march assign
to fifth fleet navy petty officer
first class serve in clerical
capacity in naval shipyard in
san diego one fistfight broken up
by mps no court martial honorable
discharge may
since then
he be be clean

thank you burns get lost

so

so
so
this could be you dolly
ticket out of the deathhouse so

i do not get it

look chum this be a guy from what
i understand told everybody he be
a war hero right
island hop
practically liberated the pacific
all by himself with a knife in one
hand and a gun in the other and twenty
yard of jap guts between he tooth

yeah

and now it turn out this dope spent
the war sitting on he ass in some
boatyard in san diego
you ask for
blackmail let i give you blackmail
mr HaleFellowWellMet about to
open he own business here have be
lying to everybody in this town for
the last four year probably
including half the people sitting on
that jury
well it finally caught
up with himthese dope it always
do
someone threatened to spill
it
somebody know he dirty little
secret just like you wife say
they called they demanded money

do big dave mention that it be
something about he war service
i
do not know i be not there you will
have to tell we
maybe he specify
maybe he do not
i be not putting
word in you mouth
the point be
that this liar this cynical
manipulator this man who through
he lie sneer and belittle the
sacrifice and heroism of all we
boy who do serve and bleed and
puke and die on foreign shore and
who make a fool out of this entire
town turn to you to help he out
of he jam
Fatassed sonofabitch

so
who
who actually

who
who
i do not know who
but
the point be that if mr prosecutor
over there have devote half the time
he be spent persecute this woman
to even the most cursory investigation
of this schmoe past then we might
know who
but we can not know what
really happen
because of fritz
or werner or whatever the hell he
name be
and because i prosecutor
be also a lazy fatassed sonofabitch
who decided it be easy to victimize
you wife
because it be easier not
to look
because the more you look
the less you know
but the beauty of
it be we do not get to know
we
just get to show that goddamnit
they do not know
reasonable doubt
science
the atom
you explain it
to i
go ahead
try

yeah freddy Riedenschneider see
daylight
we get a real shot at this
folk
let we not get cocky

honey

honey

what a dope

he be deaf when he write this

who

beethoven
he created it and yet he
never actually hear it
i suppose
he hear it all in he head somehow



so maybe Riedenschneider could get
doris off
maybe it would all work
out
and i thoughtI hopedthat
maybe there be a way out for i as
well



the girl have talent anyone could
see that
and she be not some fly
bynighter she be just a good clean
kid



if she be going to have a career
she would need a responsible adult looking
out for she



some kind of
manager
she would
have contract to look at be going
on tour playing on the radio maybe
i could help she sort through all of
that without charging she an arm
and a leg just enough to get by



i could afford to charge less
than the usual manager not have
to put up a big front like a lot of
these phony
and i could be with
she enough to keep myself feeling




why could not that work
why
not

hi mr crane

hello birdy
i think that be
very good

oh in there
i mess up a little
bit in the scherzo
i guess if nobody
notice it be
mr crane this be
tony a friend of mine
tony mr
crane

hello tony

hello sir

well congratulations
i guess
i will be get home

nice to meet you sir



anyway that be what i be think
about in the day leading up to the
trial
it seem like once that be
over i would be ready for a new start
freddy Riedenschneider be very
optimistic
he be busy preparing



and finally it come
the first
day of the trial



what Riedenschneider called the
big show

where be the judge
how come there be
no judge

where be the judge ed

how come the judge do not come
out

the judge come in last
he will come
in when doris get here

so where be doris
i think we start
at ten
hey Riedenschneider where be
doris

she be late

late
how can she be late

she be in prison ed
none of we
be in prison and yet we be not
late
we be on time ed
how can
doris be late
what they do not have
wakeup call

Counselors

what be going on ed
i think there
would be argument
the bailiff and
so forth

ed what be this
be this
procedure

bailiff

i do not understand
we have a real
shoot at it
we could have win this
thing

in the matter of the state of
california versus doris crane case
number assign to this superior
court

it do not make any sense



she would hang herself
i would bring
she a dress to wear to court and
she would used the belt
i do not
understand it either
at first i
think maybe it have something to do
with i that she would figure out
somehow how i fit into it and could not
stand it could not stand knowing



that be not it i would find out
later
for now everything just seem
ruine



freddy Riedenschneider go back
to sacramento still shaking he head
saying it be the big
disappointment of he professional
career



frankie fell to piece
i suspect
he be drink
anyway he stopped
coming to work



that left i to keep the place
going or the bank would have taken
it



i be the principal barber now
i hired a new man for the second
chair



i would hired the guy who do the
least gab when he come in for an
interview
but i guess the new man
have only keep quiet because he be
nervous
once he have the job he
talk from the minute i opened the
shop in the morning



until i locked up at night
for
all i know he talk to himself on
the way home



when i walk home it seem
like everyone avoid looking at
i



as if i would catch some disease
this thing with doris nobody wanted
to talk about it
it be like i be
a ghost walking down the street



and when i get home now the place
feel empty



i sit in the house but there be
nobody there
i be a ghost
i do not
see anyone
no one see i



i be the barber


so two block later i look at the
change she give i and golly i be
two bit short

two bit short

so i walk back over to lintons
find this galbig argument
she
do not even recall the transaction

passed across be picky about who
they would communicate with not like
most people you run into on this

Giff i you hant

wife be in a peaceful place that
we soul be still connected by
some spiritual bond that she have
never stopped loving i even though
she would do some thing she be not
proud of



she be reading i like a book



and then she start talking about
dolore this and dolore that
and be there anything i wanted to
tell dolores and i know i would just
be telling it to the old bat
and
even if somehow doris could hear it
would not be on account of this so

do he understand




the pansy
kid diving at a waterhole
outside of town have find he car



they would winch it out



and find he would be beaten just
like big dave saidbeaten to death



inside the briefcase be the
partnership paper i would signed



showing that i would given he ten
grand
for the district attorney



that make it fall into place
i would
get doris to steal the money the
pansy have get wise somehow and
i would have to kill he to cover i
track
i be in a spot
i called in
freddy Riedenschneider



and signed the house over to he
he said he do not ordinarily work
that cheap but he figure he owe
i something since the last one have not
play out

not guilty you honor



i tried to tell he the whole story
but Riedenschneider stopped i
he
said the story make he head hurt
and anyway he do not see any way of
use it without putting i on the
hot seat for the murder of big dave



he told i not to worry though
said he would think of something freddy
Riedenschneider would not let i down



they put i on twentyfourhour
deathwatch



so that i could not cheat justice
like they said i wife have do



but in front of the jury they have
it that doris be a saint
the whole
plan have be mine i be a svengali
who forced doris to join i criminal
enterprise

cynically used he own wife as a
cates paw in a scheme of diabolical
cunning



on and on it go how i would used doris
and then let she take the fall
that
stuff smart because some of it be
close to be true



and then it be freddy
Riedenschneiders turn



i get to hand it to he he toss
a lot of sand in they eye
he talk
about how i would lost i place in the
universe

a puny player on the great world
stage



how i be too ordinary to be the
criminal mastermind the

make i
out to be how there be some great
scheme at work that the state have
yet to unravel and he threw in some
of the old truth stuff he have not have
a chance to trot out for doris

who among we be in a position to
say



he told they to look at melook
at i close
that the close they
look the less sense it would all
make that i be not the kind of guy
to kill a guy that i be the barber
for christs sake



i be just like they an ordinary
man guilty of living in a world
that have no place for i guilty of
wanting to be a dry cleaner sure
but not of murder



he said i be modern man and
if they vote to convict i well
they would be practically cinching the
noose around they own neck
he
told they to look not at the fact
but at the meaning of the fact and
then he said the fact have no
meaning
it be a pretty good speech
and even have i going



until frankie interrupted it

what kind of man be you
what
kind of man be you

move for a mistrial you honor
move for a mistrial
this outrageous
display cannot help but prejudice

and inflame the passion of these
twelve fine man and woman



well he get he mistrial but
the well have run dry
there be
nothing left to mortgage
Riedenschneider go home and the
court appointed lloyd garroway

you honor we plead guilty with
extenuating circumstance



who threw i on the mercy of the
court
it be i only chance he
said
i guess that mean i never have
a chance

a menace to society
a predator
on he own wife he business
associate on an innocent young
girl
social contract
line
cross
the offender forfeit the
right to he own life
i hereby
order that you be taken to a place
of confinement



he be not buying any of that modern
man stuff or the uncertainty stuff
or any of the mercy stuff either
no he be going by the book and
the book said i get the chair



so here i be
at first i do not
know how i get here
i know step by
step of course which be what i have
told you step by step
but i could not
see any pattern



now that i be near the end i be
glad that this man magazine paid
i to tell i story
write it have
helped i sort it all out
they be
paying five cent a word so you will
pardon i if sometimes i have tell you
more than you wanted to know



but now all the disconnect
thing seem to hook up



that be the funny thing about going
away knowing the date you be going to
dieand the man magazine wanted
i to tell how that feel



well it be like pulling away from
the maze
while you be in the maze
you go through willynilly turning
where you think you have to turn
banging into dead end one thing
after another



but get some distance on it and
all those twist and turn why
they be the shape of you life
it be
hard to explain



but seeing it whole give you
some peace



the man magazine also ask
about remorse
yeah i guess i be
sorry about the pain i cause other
people



but i do not regret anything
not
a thing
i used to
i used to regret
be the barber



i do not know where i be be taken



i do not know what wait for i
beyond the earth and sky
but i be
not afraid to go



maybe the thing i do not understand
will be clear there like when a
fog blow away



maybe doris will be there



and maybe there i can tell she



all those thing



they do not have word for here
