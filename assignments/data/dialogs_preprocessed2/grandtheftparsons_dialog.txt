what be a berkeley

luxury casket of solid
mahogany finished with a split
hinge lid eight brass plate
casket handle and an engrave
inscription plate

parsons

parsons
and he be a
musician

be
he be a musician

i be afraid we have no official
notification of death


at this current time the greater
los angeles registrar of birth
marriage and death do not
regard the local newspaper as an
official recorder of record

can we please talk about this
later
this be not a great place
to be right now

oh just a minute
now i
understand
you think there be a
body back there

you think there be a body in the
coffin

i can fully understand why you would
think that
i mean it be a
coffin and all
but would i
would i really steal a real
live dead body

you just give the body away

well it be not like this be a
bank
people round here do not
generally take dead body
they be not entitled to

why do you give it to he


well he signed for it

who signed for it

john nobody

and where do i find this john
nobody

there

empty

absolutely completely totally

it look pretty heavy for an
empty casket

they be make of fine
poplar
that be very heavy wood

poplar
no way
mahogany or
oak but not

look i be not going to argue with
you now
poplar be very well
suited to the make of coffin


okay
so why have we get an
empty coffin in the back of the
car

i be
selling they on to a
company in palm spring
lots of
stiff lots of money
and then
of course it be very
environmentally sound
and
look under the circumstance
perhaps we should renegotiate the
financial arrangement between we

Fiftyfifty
that baby worth
two grand

do not forget now

notification of death

so then bobby transfer they into
hardboard box just prior to the
cremation and i drive the casket
over to a guy i know in palm
spring who resell they


as new

well i be not sure the one
careful owner thing work with
coffin

the whole thing be completely
immoral

yeah well
i see how outraged
you be back there when i
mention money
just think of
it as recycle

you will learn about phil kaufman
if you stick around long enough

and you know he

i know he be a brainless
interfering asshole yes

machine
how be you

hello kaufman
i know what
you be up to you thieve
bastard
i know where you be
going and i know about you
sick revolting plan and i be
coming after you
and when i
catch you

sonofabitch

who phil kaufman really be
do

of

or maybe you already know i be
right

you do not know shit about he

well why do not we find out

so what be that about

sunstroke

you have hardly left the car since
we meet
how can you have
sunstroke

i be susceptible


you be a winner that be what you
be
winner

turn off here

this be not the way to palm
spring

it be if you be a coffin
smuggler



good afternoon

hello

i will take that one please

fifty cent


i be wonder
have you see
a hearse pass this way in the
last couple of hour

what be it look like

well
it
it be a big car

big yellow car
two guy inside

be one of they sick in they
bush

well
i do not know
maybe

yup
i see it

see the yin be the negative
the darkside
and the yang
represent positive good
if
you like the first be earth and
the second heaven


the yin yang symbol be really
evocative about the whole
concept
as you travel around
the circle white or black will
increase until the opposite color
be almost go
but never
totally go right
and this
cycle then repeat for the
opposite color



what seem like yin be often
supported by yang and vice
versa
let i give you an
example
to truly know good you
must first know evil and without
good as a comparison nothing can
be evil
so by allow yin to
flourish you welcome yan
by
letting go of yin you be
waiting for it return
another
example be

it would be really nice if we
could get through a couple of
hour without crashing the car

i be distract

of course you be


i do not believe it
middle of
nowhere and
quick stand in
front of the car

what now

pretend we be have a
conversation

okay
what about

i do not know what about
ever

Yabba yabba yabba every wake
minute

supersonic supercharged car the
darkside

i do okay
listen i be an
orphan at fourteen and a waitress
at fifteen
i do what i do
because it put food on i table
and because if i do not look after
myself noone else will

so what do you want from we

i do not want anything from you
it would be a bonus to see
kaufman crash and burn but i
do not need to be there when it
happen

why do you hate phil so much

gram be the first good guy i
ever hook up with
he be not
perfect but it worked between
we
we just seem to fit
together
but gram be already
wild and i make he wild
kaufman watch over he like a
hawk and when he feel thing
be get out of control he
turned gram against i
i lost
the only decent thing in i life

surely phil be just looking
after gram


gram be an adult
he do not
need a nursemaid

except that now he be dead

yeah
without i help and while
kaufman be babysit

i do not like you much barbara

what gram wanted

what cruise around the desert
until he start to smell
be
you both bombed


do you have friend

of course i have friend

well what would you do for they

anything within reason

that be what i hate about people
like you
Everythings within
reason
there be always
boundary proviso
you only
operate with a safety net

tell i something if it be the
other way round would gram be
sitting here driving you bone
out into the desert

well

you have missed the point
see it
do not matter what he would do
or what you and you tiedyed
friend think be the correct way
to behave
to i it only
matter what i do
where you
have boundary and limit and
threshold i only have right
and wrong
if i make a promise
i keep it that be right
if i
break that promise that be
wrong


Ohmygod

you make i do it you bastard
i have never hit anyone in i life
but you push and you push
and
you give i no choice

what the hell do that mean

it mean that you be never
there when it matter to gram
it mean that you stopped be a
father the moment he stopped
do you bid
it mean
that you learned to care too
late
that be what it mean

i do not have to justify i
relationship with gram to you

not to i no

it be true that when gram left
college we drift apart


he be a disappointment to i
because he would not use his
brain
he have so much to offer
but he let it trickle away

no he give it he all but in a
way you could never understand
and all he ever wanted from you
be approval
he wanted you to
be proud of what he have achieve

i keep everything
every record
every article every photo

it be no good telling i
you
should have tell he

i loved he

too late

i understand that you be his
righthand man as well as he
friend

i be both yes

and that you be not there when
he die
when he needed you
most

so the guilt be not all mine
then
