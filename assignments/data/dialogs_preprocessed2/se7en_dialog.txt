there be nothing wrong

not that it be any of i business
but
be you figure on moving out here
eventually

soon

i just never see a man mortgage an
empty house before

everything here still seem
seem so
strange to i
all this

i would say this place be
about as normal as place get

that be exactly what i mean
strange

what the fuck do you care

do that car belong to you

yeah it be i car alright
fuck off

you be telling i that be you car

well for some strange reason i do not
believe you

you can fucking suck i

neighbors hear they screaming at each
other
it be nothing new or unusual
but then they hear the gun go off
boom boom
both barrel

do he wife confess
do she actually
speak the word

when the patrolman get here she be
trying to put he head back together
she be crying too hard to say anything
crime of passion

yes
look at all the passion splattered
up on the wall here

this be a do deal
all but the
paperwork

do they son see it happen

what kind of question be that
huh
he be dead
he wife killed he
there
it be
that be all
anything else have
nothing to do with nothing

you and you fuck question
somerset
i be glad i be get rid of
you today
you know that you fuck

uh
lieutenant somerset

i be david mills
you new partner

i be a little throw
i just finished
orientation at central and they dump
i off down here

i hear you bring in two smalltimers
last night

yeah
two real idiot

since we be just starting out i
think we could go to a bar
sit and
talk for awhile
that way we can

excuse i but i would rather start sniff
for a case if it be all the same to you
see how we only have a week for this
whole transition thing
i want to get into the shit a
s
a
p

know what i mean

i mean to ask you something
when we
speak on the phone
i can not help
wonder
why be you here

i
i do not follow

all this effort you have go through to
be transferred from philadelphia to
here
it be the first question that pop
into i head

i be here for the same reason as you i
guess
or
at least the same reason
you used to have for be here
before you decided to give up

you think you know i
you just meet i
two minute ago

maybe i do not understand the question

it be very simple
you have come from the
city of brotherly love to the city of
brotherly hate detective
i have never
see it do that way

i do not know
maybe i think i could
do more good here than there
you know it would be great by i if we
do not start right out kicking each
other in the ball
but you be calling
the shot lieutenant so however you
want it to go

let i tell you how i want this to go
i want you to look and i want you to
listen

i be not standing around philly guard
the fuck liberty bell

but you have never work homicide in
this
city

i realize that

well please do i the favor of
remembering it

at what time do you confirm the death

like i said we do not touch anything
but we be on scene at like ofive
hundred so he be have he face in a plate
of spaghetti for about half an hour

wait wait wait
you do not check he
you do not check vital sign

believe i he be go
unless he be
breathe spaghetti sauce now

no
the point be when you be first man
in you check vital sign

this guy sitting in a pile of he own
shit and piss
if he be not dead he
would have stand up by now

listen godzilla

thank you officer davis
we will see you
again after we have have a look

yes sir

i wonder what exactly be the point of
the conversation you be about to get
into

and i wonder how many time officer
davis there have find a supposedly dead
man who do not really die until davis
be back in the patrol car calling the
morgue and eating a powder donut

drop it
we have more important
concern just now do not we

fine
for now

bon appetit

i guess that make it homicide

still he could have tied himself in
to make it look like murder

i do not see any blood or bruise yet
no wound
you see anything

not yet

i see a guy once
commit suicide
but he wanted to make sure he family
could collect insurance money right

so this guy take this big knife
and
he held it behind he put the tip of it
in he back and he run backwards into
the wall
because he think it be
going to look like someone stabbed he
in the back

except he poked a big fuck hole in
the dry wall when he do it

if you could
spare i the anecdote
for now
leave the refrigerator open
for the light

malebonding thing going

back up where we left off right

what

that be the theme from tv mod squad
i be surprise nobody get that one

excuse i
excuse i

goodnight

goodnight

if you take a look here buddy
i can tell you it be not a poison
if you can see
i have empty all of everything out of
the stomach
but look at it now that
i take away the liver

i move the lung over
first see how
big this fat sonofabitch stomach be
now
here be the strange thing on the
stomach
stretch
and here be it distended
look at the
size of that because of the food

i can see what you be pointing at

on the stomach
the line of
distention

doctor be you saying this man
eat
till he burst

yes well he do not actually burst
he
be bleeding inside of himself
and there be a hemotoma on the
outside
on the belly

he die by eat

someone punched he or kick he

oh and there be this here
something
else you have to look at and see

most of he stomach content be in the
lab now
but this
i find these in
the fat mane stomach

plastic

why these be in a fat mane stomach i
do not know

those bruise on the back of the
victim head be cause by the muzzle
of a gun

so the killer have he at gunpoint and
give he a choice
eat or get you head
blown off

he be forcefed
till he body
start reject the food
he
literally could not eat another bite

so the killer held a bucket under he

he throat be swollen from the effort
he be bleeding internally
he must have black out
and if
you be the killer you be not going to
want to wait around for he to die

you kick he pop he like a fuck
balloon
somerset look here

same color and texture

if this be what that be
it do not
make sense
it do not figure

always look for one thing to focus on
there be always one singular thing and
it might be as small as a speck of dust
but find it and focus
till it be an
exhaust possibility

how be piece of the floor going to get
in the guy stomach

exactly
why would so many piece be
inside he stomach unless they be
place there intentionally

dear detective
long be the way and
hard that out of hell lead up to the
light

this be not good

milton

what

it be a quote from a book
Miltons
paradise lose

i said to myself i be not going to screw
around with this
nope
fuck that
it be still pretty fresh meat
i called
the medical examiner
he be coming
when i get to it i know
as soon as i
laid eye on it i know



this be you guy who do this

pound of flesh

one pound of flesh no more no less
no
cartilage no bone but only flesh
this task do and he would go free


this victim mr
gold be tied down
nude holding a carve knife
and he
be given a long time
to decide
where to make the first cut
there be a
gun to you head
but what part or
part of you body be expendable

mr
gold tried for the whole pound at
once he love handle
but he go
into shock
bleed to death

what be the point somerset

look at both killing together
this
murderer be an artist

an artist

he use color and symbol
he
position the body after death so
he be working with composition
it be
be premeditate
so
meticulously
and
this be just the begin

wrong
for all we know we might never
hear from he again and i do not want
that kind of talk floating around

the circle
and the triangle on the wall
there be
something about they
these murder
mean
something

mills first case

this be not i first case fuckhead

i do not have anyone else to give this
to somerset

be possible but we may have
underestimated this guy
the type of
intestinal fortitude it must take
to
keep a man bound for a full year
to
sever he hand and use it to plant
fingerprint

i want he bad
i do not just want to
catch he anymore
i want to hurt he

listen
we have to divorce ourselves
from we emotion here
we have to keep
focus on the small detail

i do not know about you somerset but i
feed off i emotion

he will string we along all the way if
we be not careful

be you listening to i

i hear you

say cheese

what the fuck be you do

i have a right officer
i

that do not mean anything
this be a
close crime scene now

you can not do this
you can not

get the fuck out of here



the public have a right to know

how do those cockroach get here so
quick

they pay cop for the inside scoop and
they pay well
you can hate they but
you well give they something or
they will make it all up

i be sorry
i just

oh it be alright
it be always
impressive to see a man feeding off he
emotion

year of immobility seem about right
judging by the deterioration of the
muscle and spinal cord
blood test
show a whole smorgasbord of drug in he
system
heroin
crack
even an
antibiotic which be administered to
keep the bed sore from infect

he have not say anything or tried to
express himself in any way

even if he brain be not mush which
it be
he chewed he own tongue off a
long time ago

there be no way he will survive

detective he would die right now of shock
if you be to shine a flashlight in his
eye

put they away
i wish you have not
bring they into the church

i needed for you to see they

there be five principal phase in the
development of early christian art
from hellenistic through the
renaissance
each period be affected
by the decree of religious leader

if this killer belong to a certain
branch of the church
if he collect
religious art from a certain period i
want to know
i have to narrow it down

the influence on these
thing he be
do could not have come before the
gothic period
what be in those picture
be presented far too asymmetrically

the color will tell the tale

each sin have a symbolic color
but the
specific color designation changed
throughout the age



this be an example
gluttony be the
sin and the color be orange
this
particular manuscript be preserve from
the th century



in the murder gluttony be green
greed be yellow
sloth be indigo

so if this murderer be as precise as
you say then you need to find out at
what period in history be gluttony
green
and so on

where do i look
if the color changed
so often

there be one man
father stone
i have not hear from he for quite some
time
this be he passion
he spent
he life study the sin
and
preaching against they
greed pride
sloth lust
envy

zeros landlord said an envelope of cash
be in the office mailbox each month
he say quote i never hear a single
complaint from this guy and nobody ever
complain about he
he be the good
tenant i ever have


there be a landlord dream tenant

paralyzed man with no tongue

who pay he rent on time

the irony be that after a day of the
type of work he do he would come home and

le
fanus green tea
murder in the rue
morgue

i mother would give he hell
because
i be young and he be keeping i up
till all hour giving i nightmare

sound like a father who wanted he son
to follow in he footstep

one birthday he give i a hardcover
book called the century of the
detective by jurgen Thorwald
it
trace the history of detection as a
science and it sealed i fate
because
it be real and that a drop of blood or
a piece of hair could solve a crime
be incredible to i



we be closing up somerset

okay thank

davids going to wonder where i be

i will give you a ride

no
please do not bother

i have to insist
if you husband find

hour he would tear i head off

i mean literally

you have live here for so long somerset
you know this city
i

it be a hard place tracy

when david and i live in philadelphia
we could afford to live on the
outskirts
but now
i hate it here
i feel scare and i
feel sick and
i hate it

you have to put blinders on sometimes
most time
but keep in mind tracy
like tonight there be small pocket of
sanity
some bar and bookstore
museum
several last vestige of
civilization

i have visit so many of the school
looking for work you know
and the
condition be
horrible
i can not
believe how bad it be
child should not have to grow up here

you can always look into the private
school
you will find something

you be too hard on yourself tracy

it be okay to hate this city
it be
natural
but there be a bright side in
all this
there be
you want to hear
it

oh god yes
please

i can not think of another place that
need education more than this city
and you be a teacher
you can make a
difference in a few people live
it be a very good thing

goodnight somerset

goodnight

i be sorry tracy
i be sorry

i
i well go

it will not be for long honey

greed envy
sloth wrath
pride

lust be sex

apple on the floor
original sin

adam and eve

sex sex sex

lust be everywhere
that be the hard
part
i think lust be the most
prevalent sin even more than greed

lust be red

bright red

blood red

red sky at night sailor delight

red blood
red head
dead

red light district

he make i do it

i have to look at you
i have to look
at you

you be not going to want to see this
more than once

he have a gun
he
he make i do it



he make i do it

and
and
and he said
he ask if
i be marry
and i could see he have
a gun in he hand

where be the girl

what
what

where be the prostitute

she be

she be
just sitting on the bed

who tied she down
you or he

the gun be in i throat

there be not going to be a happy end
it be not possible

if we get he i will be happy enough

no
face it now
stop think it be
good guy against the bad guy in this
city

how can you say that
especially after
today

you tell i
when you walk into an
apartment and a man have beaten he wife
to death or a wife murdered she
husband in cold blood
and you have to
wash the blood off they child
you
put the killer in jail
who win

if i think like you i would have slit i
wrist a long time ago

where be the victory

you do you job
follow the law and do
the good you can
it be all there

if we caught john doe tomorrow and it
turned out he be the devil
if it
turned out he be literally satan then
that might live up to we expectation
no human being could do these horrible
thing right
but this be not the
devil
it be only a man

why do not you shut the fuck up for a
while
huh
you make these
speech
like you know everything
there be to know

you think you be preparing i for the
hard time ahead
you think you be toughen i up
well you be not
you be quit fine
but i be staying
to fight

who be you fighting for
people do not
want a champion
they just want to keep
playing the lottery and eat
hamburger

what the fuck be wrong with you huh
what burn you out

there be no one thing if that be what you
mean
i just
i can not live anymore
where stupidity be embrace and nurture
as if it be a virtue

you be so much good than everyone
right
no one worthy of you

wrong
i sympathize completely
because if you can not win
then if you
do not ignore everything and everyone
around you you go insane
it be easy
to smoke crack and not worry that you
wife and kid be starve to death
and it be so much easy to bear a child
till that child finally shut up
because it take so much work to love
and if you bothered to think about the
abuse and the damage you would be sad

you be talking about people who be
mentally i will
you be

no i be not
i be talking about common
everyday life here
where ignorance
be not bliss it be a matter of survival

listen to yourself
you say the
problem with people be they do not care
so i do not care about people
but if
you be not part of the solution

people who be in argument over they
head always use meaningless slogan
but life do not conform to analogy

you be already here and you have be
here a long time
so there be a part of
you that know even if everything you
say be true none of it matter

that part of i be dead

fuck you
you want i to agree with
you
yeah you be right somerset
this place be fucked
let we go live in
a fuck log cabin
well i do not
agree with you
you be quit and it
make i sick
because you be the good
i have ever see

thanks for the beer

david

i love you

david

i love you

hello



hello somerset
it be tracy

be everything alright



yes
Everythings fine
could
could
you meet i somewhere
to talk

i do not think that be a good idea



i need to talk to someone somerset
you be the only friend i have here
i
do not know anyone else

david do not know about this
you
have not tell he

i have to tell you tracy i be not the
one to talk to about this

i just can not think straight
i do not
know why i called you except i can not
stand to hold it as a secret anymore
i
have to get it out
and i can not tell
david yet
not yet

i
i have a relationship once very
much like a marriage
and there be a
baby
long time ago
thing be
good
and i get up one morning and i
go on a case
a murder like any
other
except it be i first since
hearing about the baby
and i feel
this fear and anxiety coming over i
i
look around and i think how can i
raise a child here
so that night i
told she i do not want we to have
child and over the next few
week
i convinced she

i mean i wear she down
slowly

i want to have child
but

i can tell you i know
i be positive i
make the right decision
i be positive
it be the right thing to do
but
there be never a day that go by that i
do not wish i have decided differently

if you
if you decide not to have the
baby
if that be what you decide then
never tell mills you be pregnant
i mean that
never tell
you marriage would just wither and die
altogether

but if you decide to have the baby
then at that very instant when you be
absolutely sure
tell he
tell he
that exact second
and spoil that kid
every chance you get

somerset

that be all the wisdom i can share with
you tracy
i barely know you

will i see you again before you leave

probably not
but it be probably good
that way

i have decided
i want to stay on till
this be over
till either it be do or
we can see it will never end

oh you want to stay now

one of two thing be going to happen
we be either going to get john doe
or he will finish he series of seven
and he will never be find

you think if you stay you be do i
some big favor

i be request you keep i on as you
partner a few more day
you would be do
i the favor

you know i would say yes

no
