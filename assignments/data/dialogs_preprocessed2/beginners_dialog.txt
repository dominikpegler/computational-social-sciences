i father print a quote from the
velveteen rabbit in large type on
the wall


the stuff rabbit ask what

and the horse said real
be not how you be make
it be a thing
that happen to you
when a child
love you for a long long time not

sometimes
do it happen all at
once like be wind up or bite by
bit
