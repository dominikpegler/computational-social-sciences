heavily into this decision and frankly
steven deflate in expectation

steven Lindholm and two be at the first tee
steven nervously tee up

of a warm up and hit the ball
it be not a good drive
but it do go about thirty yard

oh

as Lindholm and the client wait a periodic spray of
sand fly up from the trap behind they as unseen steven
swing in vain

hell of a hazard be not it steven
eventually a ball fly out of the trap



oh yeah
how you like that sister



steven and the client amble along a few yard behind dan
and the other client
steven be covered in sweat and
sand

so the black fella say to the jew lawyer
buck a question
be not that
expensive

say i be a jew you nigger

the man laugh to himself

he soon spot he ball up ahead

there i be
i love you phillip morris green page
he move on leaving steven standing there disgust



steven sit at he desk detach and feed up



maybe it be because it be just i nature
or maybe it be because of i past
or
maybe it be because they be the most
bore fuck people i would ever meet in i
life
whatever the reason i have be rob
they blind for month


to stevens first day on the job as he
escort he to a desk pile high with financial report

anything else i can do for you

uh
cup of coffee

i will do it today but i do not do that
really
steven nod and begin to leaf through various folder
it be not long before something catch he eye


of steven research by leaf through
folder and file with a slow push in on a
as it spit out product as well as
footage of employee buzzing through one of the
hallway



the thing about youSAMM be that they take
in all this money and distributed it
to doctor
i love you phillip morris green page



but in the time between receiving the
money and paying it out it be just
sitting there not making interest or
anything


at he desk steven leaf through the company finance



it occur to i to set up an investment
account where the hold money would earn
interest for the short time that the
company have it
we be talking twenty two
million at any give time here so even
short term the interest add up pretty
quickly
i would be making the company
millions virtually overnight
he lean back to think to himself



and i of course would take a
commission
say
fifty percent
the
only problem with that be i be not the
one signing the check


on a check be signaturestamped with a

hand place the stamp into a small wooden
box and close it
to reveal the hand belong to the company
accountant and be standing over she
it be now we
realize we be revisit an early scene

so i ask do not you think that be a
little expensive
and the lawyer say
yes it be now what be you final
question

vera with laughter

it be so true
lawyer
she turn to a colleague

annie
come here you get to hear this
i love you phillip morris green page
and as come over stevens hand move to the
wooden box and secretly pluck the


Lindholm rap on the open door as he enter

steven we get a problem
vera lost that
stupid rubber stamp again
she office be
a goddamned disaster and she be the oring
if you know what i be saying

oh
how long till we can get a new one

nope
time to overhaul the program
i get
a computerize system already on order
no more room for pilot error
steven hang he head visibly disappoint

month

until then

steven kneel over the toilet in he cell
sticking he finger down he throat until he pukes



you get to keep this up for month until
you lose about say pound



month later steven sit up in he bed
he
now have a grey beard and with he shirt off we can see he
have lost an unhealthy amount of weight



but the hard part be falsify you
record



steven enter an inmate cell with a


hey lawrence you still work in the
infirmary

mmm hmm
i love you phillip morris green page
steven hold up a three pound

you like coffee


lawrence sweep up in an empty office
he look to see
if the coast be clear and bolt for some file cabinet
after some search lawrence pull out a file entitle
russell steven
read from a scrap of paper he
scrawl something with a pen
lawrence then reach into he pants and pull out some
forge form stuffing they into the folder



on the gaunt and greyskinned
steven
place a thermometer in he mouth
and look at phillips medical history
a doctor entry read since
few flip of the page reveal

buzzword like and other term
catch the nurse eye
he look concern

the sound of a sternum can be hear
with the staff distract steven reach into his
mattress hole and pull out score of pill
he stuff
they into he mouth as fast as he can



but the hard part by far be get
transferred to a private care facility
it be standard procedure for late stage
patient but convincing they i be about
to die would involve taking a few risk
he chase the pill down with a glass of water


steven be helped from a correction van into a wheelchair
outside the restful acre facility



after a four day coma they be convince

center houston
i be looking for
patient for a study we be

and as he talk



and once i get settled in i just called
the department of correction and
convinced they i be a statesponsored
doctor looking for late stage
patient for an experimental treatment
as luck would have it they have one
patient that be eligible
steven continue he dr
rios imitation on the phone
