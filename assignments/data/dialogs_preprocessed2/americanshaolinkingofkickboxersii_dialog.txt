the temple

they let he in

how long

long time through the bad weather
he just sit
there unmoving through rain sleet snow

do they let he in

no
of course they do what kind of story do you think i
bau bau would tell
he stay in front of the temple
until they could no longer say no

one of the most famous monk in the history of the
temple

please tell you grandfather you bau bau he be a wise

leave
i think

have it be hard

it be at first
i be uncomfortable in pain actually
but as time go on i get
into it i guess
the
sacrifice make i feel
in control you know what i
mean

much of the train at the temple be in that direction
self sacrifice
tell i more

at first i be really bore and very lonely
but then
thing changed
maybe it be like hitting the wall in
running it be like i become part of the courtyard and
i feel powerful
even the spider become i friend

it be an incredible experience i said i would do it and i
do it

i wish you all the good

same to you


they be disciple
this be the last class for fight
monk at shaolin

an uninformed choice be no choice at all

here at the temple we use a period of intense physical
labor to test you patience and to teach you humility

important lesson to obey you shr fu without question
because of this i have decided to begin you martial
train sooner than what be prescribed

and what do you have to say to i

i
i mean we just wanted to
thank you for the
opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the
shaolin temple

m

alternating with work and meditation
sunday afternoon be
free time

in order to keep we body strong Bodhidharma give we a
series of exercise and breathe technique
because the
time demanded action we developed shaolin style wu shu
from these exercise

the spirit of Bodhidharma remains
train be like
meditation
be aware of everything but aware of nothing
in particular
think not think

what do you mean think not think

Non think

you train begin today in this most sacred of
train hall
the floor bear witness to the effort of
fighting monk from century past

at the shaolin temple we forge we body in the fire of
we will
we adhere to a vow of nonviolence unless
someone else be in danger
follow i movement

i can not do this


here at shaolin can not do not exist
only will not

block the way i show you

this be the way i be taught

do it this way
you will not get hit

i turn

emotion cloud the spirit eliminate they

this be not martial art it be gymnastics

this be shaolin wu shu
continue


i want to go over some takedowns before we end for the
day
i will need a partner


watch carefully as i take he down use technique from
shwai jyau chinese wrestle

excuse i master but there be not any mat here


do they always use mat in america



if you be scare i will get someone else
perhaps gao
would assist i

let we do it


attack i straight on


any question
good that be all for today

i be not sure i get that last throw clear in i mind


i said that be enough

if you be get too old for this kind of train i
understand


attack

i think i have get it now
xie xie

be you trying to kill yourself

he hurt more than i he be just not bleeding that be
all

if you go to san de he can send you to a doctor

i appreciate you concern li but it be not that serious
i be all right


concentrate on you stance
all i want you to do be try
to hold you stance
li you be first


next

think i would join you guy


in this exercise you try to touch you partner chest
lightly and you partner try to block


something wrong


switch

the goal of this drill be not to hurt you partner
just
try to tap he chest

i know but

then do it that way

this sure beat sweep


sweep the main chamber drew

yes master

present the great fighter in the history of the
shaolin temple
drew carson

the crowd be going wild

he be an amazing monk

yeah what be up with he

come with i

legend state that Bodhidharma give we tea
once while
meditate Bodhidharma fell asleep a natural reaction
we all have to fight against

when he awake he be so enraged at he eyelid for
betray he he tear they off and threw they to the
ground
from those eyelid grow the first tea bush
you see even
the leave look like eyelid

impossible

nothing be impossible if you spirit be pure and you
will be strong

i understand you have be questioning some of the
teaching of the temple

it be just not the way i be taught

master
stop
no more will go in

exactly
you be like this cup full of what you have
learned
how can we show you shaolin unless you first
empty you cup

the rule and discipline of the temple exist to free
you not restrict you
they keep you mind from harmful
thought
drink you tea

it be not fighting i feel like i be dancing or
something
this soft stuff be unnatural fight
should be hard tough


if i hand be always like this what would you call it

deformed


and if it be always like this

again deform


remember let no one know you be disciple at the
shaolin temple but do not forget that you be
Dzai
Jyan

drew

chill out guy
it be we day off

what tip you off

we be not allow to have contact with female
it be
the most serious rule of the temple

it be a stupid rule li
but




here

what

you can get kick out of the temple for this

who be going to tell li
you

not the giggle girl again
Howve you be

back home in new york you do not say
no to a party
where be you sense of adventure

what do you do at a party with girl

you dance and talk
and have a good time

that clinch it we can not dance

and we do not know how to talk to girl

that be easy
you just talk to they like you would to the
guy you just do not tell they as much and
not in
the same way

like you know

look dancing easy
i will show you
we will start with
slow dance

dirty dance

disciple gao be good than i

i lost i temper
he be only defending himself

be this true disciple gao

yes
but i be not completely blameless

i do not think you be
the shaolin martial tradition be build on challenge
we
challenge ourselves but we do not fight with each other
never do we fight to see who be best we train to be
able to right wrong not to let we hand and foot
express emotion run wild
shaolin never throw a punch
or kick in anger
shake hand and let you emotion go

that be the golden sash the high honor of the temple
it be award to the monk who have attain the pinnacle
of understand

the good fighter

among other thing
fight be only a small part of
be a shaolin monk

yours

fight monk

what should be do

someone should face he in combat
for the tradition of
the temple

there be some time when a shaolin must fight and some
people who will not learn until they be taught a lesson

it be you call

for the temple
