we be
on we way to delhi
this be miss
scott and mr
round
i name
indiana jones

dr
jones
the eminent archae
ologist

hard to believe be not it

i remember first hear you name
when i be study at oxford
i
be Chattar lal prime minister for
he highness the maharajah of Pankot

welcome to Pankot palace




how do you like to run into he in
a dark alley
that one kind of
cute
i could see myself marry
to a prince like that

the plane crash and you journey
here sound most incredible

you should have be there

we would appreciate it if the Mahara
jah would let we stay tonight
we will be on out way in the morn
ing

i be only he humble servant but
the maharajah usually listen to
i advice

be that he

he be not exactly what we call
a spring chicken

no no that be Uhmed singh the
present maharajah late father

oh good
and maybe the pres
ent Marahajah be a little young
and thin

they will escort you to you room
now
you will be provide with
fresh clothes
tonight you will
be dining with he highness

dinner
and with a prince
i
luck be changing
but look at
i i god i have to to get
ready

eight of the clock in the pleasure
pavilion





you look like a princess

it be sort of like be in heaven




i have always have a weakness for
folk dance

she might get away with that act
here but she would never make it in
a real nightclub

we be fortunate tonight to have
some many unexpected guest
he
be captain phillip Blumburtt

captain Blumburtt and he troop
be here to check up on the
native


just a routine inspection tour

the british worry so about they
Emprie it make we feel like
wellcaredfor child

listen mr
lal what do you call
the maharajah wife

he highness have not yet taken a
wife

no
well i guess he just have not
meet the right woman


interest in local curio

no
but i be interest in the
occult
and this be a krtya


charming

it be like the voodoo doll of west
africa
the kryta represent you
enemy and give you complete
power over he


that god all that mumbo jumbo
rubbish be disappearing

you think so


of course
admittedly it be taken
time
Britians controlled india
for almost two hundred eyars now

you be hanging on well here
than you do in america


this be a different situation dr
jones
these people be like
child
we have to lead they
slowly into the twentieth century

the prime minister do not seem
that naive


no he be a very shrewd old boy
power behind the throne and all
that
he actually run this whole
province

i think this maharajah be swim
ming in money
maybe coming here
be not such a bad idea


i believe we be be called to
dinner

finally

he Supremem highness guardian of
rajput tradition the maharajah
of Pankot zalim singh

that be the maharajah that kid

maybe he like old woman

cheer up you lost you prince
but dinner on the way

i have never be so hungry in i
life

i god sort of grusome be not
it

he highness want i to welcome
he visitor
especially the
renowned dr
jones from america

we be honore to be here

suddenly i be not so hungry

i have a question mr
prime mini
ster
i be examining some of the
maharajah artifact

very fine collection of very old
piece do not you think

yes very fine
but not all of the
piece look old
some be carved
recently and look like image used
by the Thuggees to worship the god
des kali

dr
jones you know very well that
the thuggee cult have be dead for
nearly a century


of course
the Thuggees be an
obscenity that worshipped kali
with human sacrifice
the brit
ish army wipe they out about the
time of the mutiny of

but you be not eating

i uh have bug for lunch

i suppose story of the Thuggees
die hard

there be no story anymore

well i do not know
we come here
from a small village and the pea
ant there told we that the Pankot
palace be growing powerful again
becuase of some ancient evil

they story be just fear and
folklore

maybe
but how do you explain
the thuggee shrine i see right
below the palace

the local peasant be just as
superstitious
you be very ob
servant dr
jones
but you be
beginning to worry capt
blum
burtt


i be not worry prime minister
just interest

give i you hat

what for

i be going to puke in it

you know the villager also
claim that this palace steal
something from they

dr
jones it we country a guest
do not usually insult he host

sorry i think we be just talking
about folklore


i be sure it be nothing
just ru
mors
what be it they claimed be
steal

something magical
sacred rock

there you see captain
rock

when they lost this rock they
field and animal die
they
also said they child be
taken from they

i think that be enough of this
nonsense dr
jones

so you have something you know
simple like soup or something

look delicious

i want to go home

i be dubious muself at first
then something connected the
village rock and the old legend
of the sankara stone

dr
jones we be all vulnerable
to vicious rumor
i seem to re
member that in honduras you be
accuse of be a grave robber
rather than a scientist

the newspaper exaggerated the
incident

and do not the sultan of Madagas
car threaten to cut you head off
if you ever return to he coun
try

that be a misunderstand

exactly what we have here dr
jones

i have hear the terrible story
of the evil thuggee cult

i think the story be tell
to frighten child
later i
learned that the thuggee cult be
once real and do unspeakable
thing

i be ashamed of what happen here
so many year ago
we keep these
object to remind we that this
will never again happen in i
kingdom

i be sorry if i have offended you

ah dessert

chilled monkey brain









rather bizarre menu woundnt you
say

even if they be trying to scare
we away a devout hindu would
never touch meat
make you wonder what these people
be

i have see this thing
what be
it dr
jones

hey nobody touch Indys whip

we be guest here shorty

you will show i how it work
please

you wish be i command you
highness

that be wonderful
please teach
i how

okay short round let go of it

the turk say that a whip can be
an enemy even to it owner
if
you get some rope it will be easy
to learn with you highness
now i think we will say goodnight





that little maharajah think he
big stuff

you do not like he do you

next time i flatten he
do you
see he eye

no

indy they glow like fire and get
real crazy
then he talk in this
real scary voice

he be afraid of you
he know a
tough guy when he see one

yeah that be what happen

i well see how willie be

i bring you something

not leftover

no real food

oh it be real food
it be
beautiful

listen i be taking
application how do you like to
be i palace slave

wear you jewel to be prin
cess
