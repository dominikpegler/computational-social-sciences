that bag

the usual thing
i be a flight
attendant with cabo air

can i be of some assistance

i doubt it
who be you friend

this be special agent ray Nicolet
with alcohol tobacco and firearm
would you mind if we look in that
bag

would i mind
do i have a choice

you have the right to say no
and i
have the right to make you wait here
with ray while i go get a warrant
and if i do not want to go through all
that trouble i could just take you
in on suspicion

suspicion of what

all he want to do be peek in you
bag
i will watch he do not take
anything

go ahead

i would say there be about oh fifty
thousand dollar here
what would you
say ray

that look like fifty thousand
dollar from here

this be you money

if i be to tell you no it
be not


you should know if you bring in
anything over ten thousand you have
to declare it
you forget or what
you could get a two hundred and fifty
thousand dollar fine plus two year
in prison
now you want to talk to we
about it or you want to talk to
custom

i be not saying another word

listen jackie hope you do not mind
if i call you jackie
they be a bunch
of fuckin prick in custom
something about that job make they
kinda hard to get along with
now do
you want to talk with a bunch of
suspicious disagreeable people like
they or a couple goodhearted guy
like mark and myself




hey this be i office
there be no
smoke

arrest i



we could smart ass
or we could
work out what be known as a
substantial assistance agreement
that be if you be will to
cooperate
tell we who give you the
money and who you be giving it to



you get a good lawyer



can she afford a good one be the
question
otherwise she will be in
Sybill brand three week easy before
the public defender get around to
she



ever hear of a fella named beaumont
livingston



do not know beaumont
that be funny
because beaumont know you
well he
do know you beaumont be find in
the trunk of a car dead
shot
twice
once in the head and once in
the chest



i have the chance to talk to beaumont
yesterday
you see like you
beaumont find himself in some hot
water
he be looking at ten year he
be pretty sure he do not want to do
and be understandably concern
now
maybe you do not know beaumont but
beaumont know you and maybe so do
the guy who blow beaumonts head off



if you do not want to talk to we i
guess we will just have to hand you
over to custom

okay let we go

you know miss brown there be
basically three type of people that
we come along in the performance of
we duty
one be
victim witness innocent
bystander
you be not any of these
then there be two

these
sonabitches have dedicated they
live to a life outside the law
that
be not you either
where you belong be
the third category
the category we
refer to as

i be not a loser

oh you be both
in you be
flying for and get bust for
carrying drug
you be carrying
they for a pilot husband of yours
he
do time and you get off
but that
end you career with the big
airline
cut to thirteen year
later
you be fortyfour year of
age
you be flying for the shitty
little shuttlefucking piece of shit
mexican airline that there be
where
you make a whop twelvethousand
dollar a year
that be not a hulluva
lot to show for a twenty year career
and to top it off you be going to
jail
now true the judge even with
you prior will probably only give
you a year or two
but this do not
seem like the time of life you get
year to throw away
now we do not like trying loser like
they be criminal
but in the absence
of a criminal we will try you
now
be not this money given to you by an
american live in mexico by the name
of cedric walker

you know ol beaumont be not much
for talkin either
yeah he told we
about you and mr
walker but whoever
the hell it be he work for out
here he would not say
could it be
the same person you be suppose to
deliver this money to

i would like you permission to open this
again
so we will know exactly how much
money we be talkin about here

help yourself

while you be at it let i see what
else be in there
you mind

i pocketbook

what be in it

beauty product

i will count the money

what be this

that be i diet shit

let we see what else be in there

oh miss brown

yeah

and what would this be sweet and
low

what the fuck be that shit

i know what it look like

you planted that shit on i

look that shit be not mine

it be not enough for trafficking but
how about posession with the intent
to distribute

oh i would not be so sure
what with
all the cash i think i could go with
conspiracy to traffic

i be tellina you i do not know nothing
about that fuckin shit

well then miss brown
why do not you
have a seat and tell we who might
know something about this fuckin
shit


if she will cooperate with we we will
turn possession with intent into
plain ol possession and she can
bond outta here for one thousand
buck
if she do not help we we will
go for the intent and request a
twentyfivethousand dollar bond

you tell those guy they will have to
do one helluva lot good than that
before i will even say ohio to they

well that be the states offer
if
you plead to possession and tell




what they want to know you
bond will be set at onethousand
dollar
if you do not



will
request one at twenty five thousand
base on you prior record and risk
of flight
if you do not post it or
do not know anyone who can you will
spend six to eight week in county
before you arraignment come up

who be side be you on

i beg you pardon

what if i plead guilty

and cooperate
you might get
probation

if i do not cooperate

with the prior
you could get
anywhere from a year to five

be she helpful

she be more helpful than the fuckin
public defender
i do not know i guess what i need be
a lawyer find out what i option
be

you know i figure out the other day
i have written something like fifteen
thousand bond since i have be in the
business
i would say about eighty
percent of they be at least drug
relate
if you want i can help you
look at you option

you be not tire of it

i be as a matter of fact

what have they tell you

so far i have be tell i can cooperate
and get probation maybe
or i can
stand mute and get as much as five
year
do that sound right

i would say if you be tried and find
guilty you will not get more than a year
and a day
that be state time
prison

shit

but they will not want to take you to
trial
they will offer you simple
possession a few month of county
time and a year or two probation
how about another

sure

you know who put the dope in you
bag

yeah but that be not what this be
about
they be fuckin waitin for
i ass
they know i have that money
they even know the amount
the one
who search i bag from




Dargus hardly even look at it
oh i would say there be fifty thousand
here
what would you say
but all
they could do be threaten i and
hand i over to custom and i could
tell they do not want to do that

they wanted you to tell they what you
know

i have they too
i burn those two
starky and hutch motherfucker down
then they ass lucked out and find
that coke

what do they want to know

who give i the money and who i be
giving it to
and some guy they find
in a trunk with he head blown off
say it be he who told they about
i

can i get you two some popcorn

no thank

that would be beaumont livingston

that be he
how do you know they

i write he on monday
they find he
dead on tuesday

Ordell pick up he bond

same as you
ten thousand

the federal agent kinda half hint
Ordell might of do beaumont

you mention a guy from




but you do not mention the federal

i do not

no you do not
what branch

ray Nicolet with alcohol tobacco
and firearm

he be the one who want you

it be the other guy who bust i

because if he bust you you would play
hell bond out of federal court
he
do not want you mad at he he want
you to tell he what you know
he
use you to get a line on Ordell
make a case then take he federal
you know what Ordells into

i have a pretty good idea
Ordell
be not no bootlegger and i doubt he be
smugglin cuban cigar
so that only
leaf one thing an


man would
be interest in

i used to bring over ten thousand at
a time
that be the legal limit so i
never bring more than that

how many trip do you make

with ten thousand
nine

he be get that kinda money

it be all in lock box in a mexico
bank
but he be get a problem
he be
what do you call it when you get
money but do not have cash

cash poor

that be it
he be cash poor
he keep on
i till i finally said okay
i will
bring whatever fit in a nineby
twelve envelope
i get paid five
hundred dollar and he friend mr
walker in mexico give i the
envelope

if you know bringing anything over
ten thousand be against the law why
not pack a hundred grand

whatever it be have to fit in i bag
and not hit you in the face if the
bag be open
this be not solvin i
problem
i get to figure out a way to
either keep i job or get out of
trouble
i be of today but if i can not
leave the country i be out of a job
and if i do not get a job i can not
hire a lawyer

ask


they might give you
permission

yeah if i cooperate

well jackie you get catch you be
going to have to give they something

but if all i can give they be Ordells
name i do not really know shit about
what he do or how he do it that
do not give i much to bargain with

give they what you get
offer to help

and a few of i friend that be
definitely the case

actress out there you like and

but
there be always one who you love
and
with she it be sorta like going
steady

and Annettes it for you

bring the money in and they follow
it

yea but i be going to dress it up
put the money in a shop bag and
hand it to someone i meet here

you do not actually do it that way

he always just picked it up at i
place
but with


involved i
want to stage it
you know make it
look more intriguing like we know
what the fuck we be do
then it be
up to ray Nicolet the


guy to
follow the shop bag

make the delivery somewhere in the
mall

right around here in the food court

sit down leave the bag under the
table

you just
missed he

he be here

yeah we be going over everything
that be why all the bag

i called you last night

i know i get you message
ray
wanted to have dinner
he wanted to
talk about the sting we be plotting
that be what he call it
sting
he be be real nice to i

you think he be get a thing for you

maybe
but i be think it might be
something like he want the money for
himself

i do not follow you logic
what do
he be nice to you have to do with
he wanting Ordells money

he be setting i up to make a
proposition

i see

you do not propose something like that
unless you be pretty sure the other
persona into it

have he hint around

not really
but i know this narcotic
cop one time
tell i that in a raid
the whole package never get back to
the station
he exact word

you know some interesting people

we be not bullshittin either
because later he be suspended and
forced to retire

have Nicolet tell you any colorful
story like that

he try to act cool

no harm in that
he be a young guy
have fun be a cop
i know the
type trust i on this
he be more
interest in Ordell than the money
if he be going to do anything suspect
it will be cutting corner to get the
conviction
but he would not walk off
with the money
it be evidence

what about you max

what
if i be in Nicolets place

no i mean you right now
not it you
be somebody else

if i see a way to walk off with a
shop bag full of money would i
take it

you know where it come from
it be not
like it be anybodies life saving
it
would not even be missed

halfamillion dollar will always
be missed

i might be tempt
especially now since i be get out
of the bail bond business

i have to stand behind all i active
bond but i be not writing any new
