what do you mean

when you be young you potential be
infinite
you might do anything really
you might be great
you might be
einstein
you might be goethe
then you
get to an age where what you might be
give way to what you have be
you
be not einstein
you be not anything
that be a bad moment
but i remembered
something carlyle write

there be no
life of a man faithfully recorded but
be a heroic poem of it sort rhym or
unrhymed
i realized i salvation might
be in recording i waste life
unflinchingly
maybe it would serve as a
cautionary tale
maybe it would help i
understand why



i name be charles prescott Barris
i
have written pop song i have be a
television producer
i be responsible
for polluting the airwave with mind
numb puerile entertainment
in
addition i have murdered thirtythree
human being
i be damn to hell





born in philadelphia pennsylvania in
i early childhood remains
accessible to i only as a series of
elliptical enigmatic memory



the taste of bologna fresh from the
butcher



the sickly sweet smell of a burn
babydoll on a crisp autumn day



velvet brushing against i tender young
skin as i mother dressed i



constant inarticulate rage leading to
fist fight after fist fight




the calm i feel watch dust suspended
in the early morning sunlight



i remember fear



love

you like the way mommy look Chuckie

yes

i bet you would like to be a mommy some
day would not you

yes mommy
please

mere you



rejection




expulsion




when i be sixteen i have an experience
with i little sister friend Tuvia that
left an indelible impression

Phoebes no walter page huh Tuvia

i do not know who that be

of course you do not
why be you waiting around anyway
listening to this cacophonous cacophony
when you could be in you own abode
disrupt the live of you own
sibling

i do not know what anything you say means

no
you would not would you


hey

what

hey Tuvia

whaat

you want to lick it

no
why should i

well for one thing it taste like
strawberry
i sister tell i you love
strawberry

yeah well
i hate strawberry

honestly a mane penis taste exactly
like a strawberry lollipop

look i know that be not true so

it be true
it be weird but it be true
i
just read a research paper on it


i first love

Uchh

like strawberry you creep

well what do it taste like

know i be going to tell you mother what
you just do

if you do i will tell you mother you make
we dog lick you crack

i do not

so what



perhaps i whole life turn at that
point
the repulsiveness of i sex
confirmed by the tastebud of a ripening
pubescent girl




and so i find myself in a downward
spiral of debauchery
endlessly chasing
pussy
i only focus in life
to get
laid to get blown trying to fool myself
into believe that given the right
combination of circumstance and
deception maybe the Tuvias of the world
could desire i the way i desire they
i only wanted to be loved



constant inarticulate rage lead to bar
fight after bar fight



as much as i tried i could not understand
i past and i present be miserable so
at twentyfour i decided what i needed
be a future

industry with a future

thril to have someone else in addition
to rex reed to talk about that stuff
