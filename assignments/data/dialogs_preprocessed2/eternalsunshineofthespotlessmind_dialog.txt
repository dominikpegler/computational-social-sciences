a good guy
it be not really settling
then i think maybe i be just a victim of
movie know
that i have some
completely unrealistic notion of what a
relationship can be
but then i think

she should know
do you believe in that stuff

i do not know

maybe
that be just coincidence
right

you think something and then it happen
or you think a word and then someone say
it
know

yeah i do not know
it be hard to know

exactly
exactly
that be exactly i
feeling about it
it be hard to know
like okay but how many time do i think
something and it do not happen
that be
what you be saying right
you forget
about those time
right

yeah i guess

but i think i be
i like to think i be

it be helpful to think there be some order
to thing
you be kind of close
mouth be not you

sorry
i life be not that interesting
i go to work
i go home
i do not know
what to say

oh

or anxious
i be
always anxious think i be not living i
life to the full know
take
advantage of every possibility
just
making sure that i be not wasting one
second of the little time i have

i think about that

you be really nice
i be sorry i yell
at you before about it
god i be an
idiot

i do have a tendency to use that word too
much

i like you
that be the thing about i
psychic thing
i think that be i
great psychic power that i get a
sense about people
i problem be i
never trust it
but i get it
and with
you i get that you be a really good guy

thanks

and anyway you sell yourself short
i
can tell
there be a lot of stuff going
on in you brain
i can tell
i
goal
can i tell you i goal

yeah

what be the goal joel
i goal joel be to just let it flow
through i
do you know what i mean
it be like there be all these emotion and
idea and they come quick and they change
and they leave and they come back in a
different form and i think we be all
taught we should be consistent
know
you love someone that be it
forever
you choose to do something with you life
that be it that be what you do
it be a
sign of maturity to stick with that and
see thing through
and i feel be
that be how you die because you stop
listening to what be true and what be
true be constantly changing
you know

yeah
i think so
it be hard to

like i wanted to talk to you
i do not
need any more reason to do it
who know
what big cosmic reason might exist

yeah

you be very nice
god i have to stop
saying that
you be nervous around i
huh

no

i be nervous
you do not need to be
nervous around i though
i like you
do you think i be repulsively fat

no not at all

i do not either
i used to
but i be
through with that
know if i do not
love i body then i be just lost
you
know

with all the wrinkle and scar and the
general falling apart that be coming
around the bend
so i have be seeing this guy

well for the last week anyway
he be
kind of a kid
kind of a goofball but
he be really stick on i which be
flatter
who would not like that
and
he be like a dope but he say these
smart and moving thing sometimes out of
nowhere that just break i heart
he be
the one who give i that crow photograph

oh yeah

that make i cry
but anyway we go
up to boston because i have this urge to
lie on i back on the charles river
it

i have this urge to go do it again so i
get patrick and we drive all night to get
there and he be sweet and said nice
thing to i but i be really
disappointment to be there with he
know
and that be where psychic stuff
come in

this be we first date date

do you remember what we talk about

naomi i guess

yeah

what be i wearing

god i should know
you hair be red
i remember it match the wallpaper

egad be you horrify

no
i think you be wearing that black
dress know with the button

no you be with i when i buy that
at that place on east th
it be late

right
something black though

i will buy that
black always good

we do talk about naomi

i said
be you sure
you seem unsure

i be sure i said

but you be not
i could tell

i be so nervous
i remember i could not
think of anything to say
there be
long silence

i think i be foolish
i think i would
mistake infatuation for love
you said

so what
infatuation be good too

and i do not have an argument

i drop you off after
you said

come up and see i
now

it be very late

yes exactly
exactly i point

this be we first time

okay so just tell i what you remember
and we will take it from there

um i liked you immediately
at the job
interview
you seem so
important
and mature
and i loved that you be
helping all these people
you do not
come on to i at all
i liked that
i
be tonguetied around you at first
i
wanted you to think i be smart
you
be so nice
i loved the way you
smell
i could not wait to come to
work
i have these fantasy of we be
marry and have kid and just
and so
then
when
that one day when i think you look
at i back
like
oh howie i can not
do this
how can i do this

it be what be best mary
you know that

yeah i know
oh god
okay well i
be so excite

remember you buy i that little
windup frog

and you said

this be for you desk
just a little
token

i know then
i know something be going
to happen
something wonderful

naomi

on the couch
dark
quiet
i wonder
if i have make a terrible mistake
i
almost reach for the phone about a
thousand time
i think i could take
it back erase it explain i have
momentarily lost i mind
then i told
myself we be not happy
that be the
truth
that what we be be safe
it be unfair to you and to i to stay in
a relationship for that reason
i
think about clementine and the spark
when i be with she but then i think
what you and i have be real and adult and
therefore significant even if it be not
much fun
but i wanted fun
i see
other people have fun and i wanted it
then i think fun be a lie that no one
be really have fun
i be be sucker
by advertise and movie bullshit
then
i think maybe not maybe not
and then
i think as i always do at this point
in i argument about dying

i projected myself to the end of i life
in some vague rendition of i old man
self
i imagined looking back with a
tremendous hole of regret in i heart

i do not pick up the phone to call you
naomi
i do not pick up the phone

yours

you take it
i do not know

naomi i really value we relationship
i hope it be possible for we to stay in
touch

do not do this to i now joel
really

i told she today i need to end it

be that what you want

i do it
i guess that mean something

so what be going on joel

i do not know i have just be think
maybe we be not happy with each other

what

know we have be i do not know sort
of unhappy with each other and

do not say we when you mean you


i think maybe we be both so used to
operating at this level that how can
one person be unhappy
if one person be
unhappy both have to be
by
definition

bullshit
who be it
you meet someone

no
i just need some space maybe

the thing be joel whatever it be you
think you have with this chick once the
thrill wear off you be just going to be
joel with the same fuck problem

it be not somebody else

i hate myself

be there a clementine who work here

calling to another male
employee
mark be clem on tonight

on i dick bro
oh hey
yeah i think she be upstairs in
philosophy

hi

i do not think you would show you face
around i again
i figure you be
humiliated
you do run away after all

sorry to track you down like this

not a stalker
but i needed to see you

i would like to
take you out or something

well you be marry

bat i be high maintenance

going to tiptoe around you marriage or
whatever it be you get going there
if
you want to be with i you be with i

so make you domestic decision and maybe
we will talk again

of
quality that seem really important

just keep that in you head
too many
guy think i be a concept or i complete

be feeling so alienate and numb
lately
forever
the thought of not

selfdestructive
how can i continue on this path toward a
live death a life filled with
obligation and guilt and responsibility
but joyless hopeless

you face
be dark and you hair be backlit i
could see a halo of frizz you ask i
if thing be okay between naomi and i

this be the night you meet clementine
joel

i told you that later

who be the girl you walk off with

no one

be this the right way

you be down by the surf
i could just
make you out in the dark

you back to i
in that orange
sweatshirt i would come to know so well
and even hate eventually
at the time i
think how cool an orange sweatshirt

i remember be draw to you even then
i think i love this woman because
she be alone down there looking out at the
black ocean

but i go back to i food
