the main problem be ray these people
be extremely distrustful of
outsider nonIndians
relation
have not be amicable

different culture
hard to penetrate
the indian do not like white cop
poke around
and that be why we be
in a position where we have to bring
in an american indian agent

with an indian representative out
there we hope to keep hostility
dormant
this be a
selective operation unit and it will
be easy on agent couture if you
can gain the people trust and maybe

woh excuse i sir
