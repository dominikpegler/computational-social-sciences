gorgeous george take a
swipe
it be an
impressive punch but micky be a quick littl
bastard and sidestep
micky do nothing to retaliate
he
hand be still by he side

gorgeous george lunge out and grab micky by the throat and
groin pick he up like a sack of spud and throw he
against the car door
all eye be on micky for a second or
two then he rise and appear little bothered by this he
get up brush himself off and start to pace again hardly
even looking at the big man

you want to stay down i friend i
promise you you want to stay down

he and put he in a headlock and charge he into the stable
door
there be a terrible noise

now you fucking stay down boy or you
will not be coming up next time
it appear as though this be going to get messy and any humour
that might have be around have now evaporated
micky raise
he head there be still no damage to speak of
all of a
sudden he start jumping up and down like he be warming up
throwing a few shadow punch taking off he shirt
this
reveal a heavily tattooe and scar torso and underneath
these embellishment be a physique that warrant some respect

this be sick

micky start pace and throwing out a couple of shadow
punch with he back to gorgeous george he still have not
really acknowledged he opponent
gorgeous george move in
for the coup de grace micky spin on he foot and catch
the big man under the jaw


we see gorgeous george lying on the floor with a
head the size of a water melon
there be blood streaming
out of every orifice in he head he be in
big trouble
we
be in slow motion
there be a lot of activity going on around
the body on the floor they mouth be open but we can not
hear what they be saying all we can hear be the voice over
given by tommy



this be not good if george do not
wake up in the next few minute i





have a problem
i be scare really
fuckin scare
there be something
coldblooded and practical about what
these people be think
they
will pop i like a hot sausage if
george do not wake up
why do they
want to go to the trouble of
explaining why a man die in a
campsite
these people do not exist
in society you can not find they
they live under they own law and
ignore everybody else
i be scare
i be really fuckin scare


we see turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his
face he have he customary pint of milk on one side he take
a sip and ohhhs and arrrs for a while

run you through if gorgeous have not
wake up

into a bare knuckle box match two
day before he have to fight the
bomber

box match

what do i say
what exactly do i
say

you said get he the vantage

that be right i clearly said get he
the vantage
so why do you get the
volante


because they look the same

the septuagint scholar mistranslated
the hebrew word for young woman in
to the greek word for virgin
because they think they look the
same coming up with the prophecy
behold a virgin shall conceive and
bear a son
but there be a world
of difference between a virgin and a
young woman like there be between a
volante and a fuckin vantage

pause
she think about this

be you saying that the fact that
you cousin hand be driving a valiant
instead of a vantage be a profound a
mistake as a whole religion

yes i fuckin be


car be he religion
he can drive
a valiant in the states but i can not
drive a vantage because they will not
tolerate the emission
well it be
too late now that be concorde



hand and he sidekick rosebud be coming out of the slide
glass door towards doug who be now standing by the car with
he arm crossed
hand be quite clearly looking for a car

how about a hug for you old cousin
doug
he stop looking for he car and focus on doug

fuck off you fat bald bastard and
where be i car


the black guy be sitting in the car still
the occasional
squeak come from the dog

how be i going to get it out

he will probably cough it up

do you think he will be alright
sol shrug

hope not

what be we waiting for

we be waiting for a man carrying a
case


why


because the deal be that we give the
russian the case and we keep the
money
he rub he finger symbolically together

what be in the case
sol turn round to talk to tyrone

fuckin ell tyrone you ask a lot of
question

they get out of the van and go up to the booky leaving
tyrone in the van
there be a double set of glass door
sol push they open and vinny walk in first while sol
hang back with the shotgun


inside be the with the case busy fill in a slip and
behind the bet counter
vinny do not mince
around and go straight to the counter where the

vinny then lean over the counter to get menace
pauline
look more than a little concern

if you know what be good for
he be cut short as pauline trigger a button under the
counter and a security screen come flying up at a very rapid
rate of knot protecting all the counter
this have the
unfortunate consequence of taking vinny with it
poor vin
be shoot straight to the ceiling all we can see be half a
body and he desperately search for ground leg
needless
to say this leave sol in a bit of a bewilder state
he be
looking the wrong way at the critical moment and be left
wonder what happen not have see vince impale on
the ceiling
sol extract the enormous shotgun

vi nce
vince
he spin round looking for he colleague
muffle noise
tell he to look up


what be you do vince
and what

few groan emanate from the other side of the counter
sol panic some more and decide that emergency action be
called for

blow he fuck head off

sol raise the gun and fire into the side
of the wall
there be an enormous explosion and a clear hole be make in
the side of the wall
the powerful kick from the gun also
make sol momentarily airborne


we see tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun


sol pull himself together and march up to the hole in the
wall that the shot created and poke the gun through

drop the screen now
you just see
what it do to this wall so think
what it could do to you
pauline know she have lost this one and look genuinely
scare

the screen come down with a thud
this mean that vince
come down with just as serious a thud
he let we out another
groan

pauline and the other clerk put two bag full of coin on
the counter
sol pick they up and frown he be not happy
with a bag full of change
he put he gun down and start
to rifle through the bag
pauline can see Vinnys pistol on
the counter drop after he encounter with the screen

pauline see she opportunity and grab the pistol
sol

vinny do sound convincingly desperate

we be going vin
he grab the bag of copper coin grab vince and march
towards the double
they open the first set and then
they try to open the second
they push the door nothing
happen
there be no going back
sol start to kick the
glass door but it do not budge
with panic rising swiftly
sol do not fuck around he take aim with the handgun and
fire the bullet shatter the glass but it do not break
through and the bullet now ricochet off both glass door
shattering bulletproof glass all around they
Vinnys panic
fill eye attempt to follow it trajectory
sol be unaware
of the ricochet and before vin have time to warn he sol
fire another bullet
now he observe the problem and wait
for the inevitable
the bullet tear through the bag of
coin which then empty it content at vins and Sols
foot
eventually the bullet hit poor vince in the thigh
sol sink to the floor he have given up
amongst the yell
emanate from vince we can hear Sols pathetic and desperate
whimper

no security eh
at that point tyrone appear and push the door open

wrong way

what the fuck be you two do
