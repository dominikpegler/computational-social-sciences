boy sweeping the aisle who stop to watch the screen



i gathered all the film footage
that exist on cobb which
be not much and rent the
local theater for the afternoon
i too have think that the great
ty cobb have be dead for awhile

the screen fill with movietone newsreel footage of
ty cobb complete with overly sincere and



this cameo of an yearold
youth show a peachesandcream
complexion and the pierce eye
of a lad who would become etc
onscreen cobb as a young ballplayer follow by
image of Cobbs famous bat stance cobb clown
etc



he reputation as be difficult
at best psychotic at bad
precede he
but if there be
one thing i know after all i
year as a journalist cover
politician celebrity and
sport hero it be this



onscreen cobb with child cobb with celebri
tie cobb in a parade honoring he and always Cobbs
dash swashbuckle style of play



the fact and public
perception of those fact
frequently bear little
resemblance
onscreen cobb in action he demon fury give
way to the fierce joy of he play
he slash a ball
up the alley turn first and never hesitate at second
and as the relay come into third



one thing be beyond argument
he be the most brilliant athlete
of he time
perhaps of any time
i be determined to find out who
be the real ty cobb
cobb slide with spike high and a cloud of dust
there
be something thril and terrifying in the image
