trying to think
straight
i know i know

magic time

this sunday hymn be inspired by the
lesson of mary magdalene
you know the
one
mary magdalene be a young lady
with a past
she be no stranger to sin
she be no stranger to practically
everybody
many condemned she
the
whole neighborhood
but one man refused
to do so
one man said hey now wait a
minute
listen to the story

hey girl

hail mary

jerusalem be a real drag
everybody
hate i

Ohhuh

people throw stone
they call i
name
i mean really

really

but wait

what be it mary

that man who be he

he be a carpenter

he be not like other guy

he be decent

he be kind

he be
dreamy
he be

yes mary

he be







jackpot
two bucket

this be so exhilarating
all week long
i can not wait till sunday when we sing

i would rather sing than do anything

it be good than ice cream

it be good than springtime

it be good than sex

i imagine

good and good sister you be
truly an inspiration
and i bear
gladsome tiding

i have keep the cardinal informed of you
progress in the neighborhood
he have
be most impress
and he have invited
you to attend a special evening mass at
st
matthews cathedral on sunday night
to sing for the council of cardinal

that be indeed glorious news bishop
we
will be honore to appear

and on such an occasion i feel a
completely traditional program will be
best

what do you mean

the council of cardinal be perhaps the
most esteem body in the entire catholic
church
they command the utmost respect
you more
secular entertainment would
be wholly out of place

but reverend mother everyone love
we new style

it be bring people back to the church

be not that why we be ask to sing for
those cardinal

i believe this can be settled by a
simple vote

vote

of course
mary clarence a convent be
not a totalitarian state
most major
decision be make by the membership as a
whole
membership that i be certain
will vote in a rational and pious manner
all those in favor of allow mary
clarence to select a program

but
wait a minute

the majority have spoken

reverend mother as always you be a
true leader
gracious and understand

it will be wonderful reverend mother
you will see

she be a pro

what

i be certain the presentation will be a
great success
congratulations mary
clarence
and congratulations to you
all

you can be a part of it

part of what
mary clarence it be
one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into
town and declare a holiday
you have
raised the sister expectation you
have excited and confused they
they
imagine this neighborhood to be some sort
of delightful ongoing block party

you and i know that life be not so
simple
there will be disappointment
rude shock
and you will have vanished
how
fortunate
