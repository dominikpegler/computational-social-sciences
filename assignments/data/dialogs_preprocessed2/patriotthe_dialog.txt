what news

the british army be barricade in
boston
harry lee be here from
virginia recruit for a
continental army

be that why the assembly be
convene

yes
he seek a levy of troop and
money

and the governor

he vow that if the assembly vote
a single shilling to lee he will
dissolve the body

which would force we delegate in
philadelphia to vote for
independence

and send we to war alongside
massachusetts

we governor be a big fool than i
thought

lee be counting on you vote and
expect you to be the first to
enlist




we first order of business

and out last if we vote a levy



mr
simms you do
not have the floor

we first order of business be an
address by colonel harry lee of the
continental army

you all know why i be here
i be
not an orator and i will not try to
convince you of the worthiness of
we because
i be a soldier and we
be at war and with the declaration
of independence we all expect from
philadelphia it will soon be a
formal state of war
in preparation
for that eight of the thirteen
colony have levy money in
support of a continental army
i
ask south carolina to be the ninth

colonel lee massachusetts may be at
war along with new hampshire and
rhode island and virginia but south
carolina be not at war

massachusetts and new hampshire be
not as far from south carolina as
you might think and the war they be
fight be not for independence of
one or two colony
it be for the
independence of a nation

and what nation be that

an american nation
colonel lee
with you permission

please

those of we who call ourselves
patriot be not seeking to give
birth to an american nation but to
protect one that already exist
it
be born a hundredandseventy year
ago at jamestown virginia and have
grow strong and more mature with
every generation rear and with
every crop sow and harvest
we
be a nation and we right as
citizen of that nation be
threatened by a tyrant three
thousand mile away

thank you
be i an orator those
be the exact word i would have
spoken

mister robinson tell i why should
i trade one tyrant three thousand
mile away for three thousand
tyrant one mile away

sir

an elected legislature can trample a
mane right just as easily as a
king can

captain marion i understood you to
be a patriot

it be mister marion

i understood he to be a patriot as
well

if you mean by a patriot be i angry
at the townsend act and the stamp
act
then i be a patriot
and what
of the navigation act
should i be
permitted to sell i tobacco to the
french trader on martinique
yes
and it be an intrusion into i
affair that i can not
legally

and what of the greedy selfserving
bastard who sit as magistrate on
the admiralty court and have fined
nearly every man in this room
should they be box about the ear
and throw onto the first ship back
to england
i will do it myself
and do i believe that the american
colony should stand as a separate
independent nation free from the
rein of king and parliament
i do
and if that make a patriot then
i be a patriot

but if you be asking whether i be
will to go to war with england
the answer be no
i have be to war
and i have no desire to do so again

this from the same captain francis
marion whose anger be so famous
during the wilderness campaign

i be intemperate in i youth
i
depart wife god bless she soul
dampen that intemperance with the
mantle of responsibility

temperance can be a convenient
disguise for fear

mister robinson i fight with
captain marion in the french and
indian war including the wilderness
campaign
we serve as scout under
washington and i have no doubt
about captain Marions courage or
competence on a battlefield
there be not a man in this room or
anywhere for that matter to whom i
would more willingly trust i life

i stand correct

nonetheless i would like to know
mister marion how
how
how

damn it francis
how in god name
do you expect to gain independence
without going to war

harry harry harry

i hairy arse
you live in a cave
if you think we will get independence
without war

gentleman
please
this be not a
tavern

be not it a union jack we fight
under

long time ago

thirteen year

that be a damn long time

gentleman
please

you be an englishman then

i be an american i just do not
know it yet

we do not have to go to war to gain
independence

balderdash

there be a thousand avenue other
than war at we disposal

name five hundred

royal petition delegate to court
judicial redress economic boycott
bribery

that be five keep going

time royal succession
regicide bribery

you said bribery twice

we do not have to go to war to gain
independence

francis i be at bunker hill
it
be as bad as anything you and i see
on the frontier
badly than the
slaughter at the Ashuelot river
the british advance three time and
we killed over seven hundred of they
at point blank range
and still
they advance and they take the
ground
that be the measure of
they resolve
if you principle
dictate independence then war be
the only way
it have come to that

i have seven child
i wife be
dead
who be to care for they if i
go to war

war be not fight only by
childless man
man must weigh his
personal responsibility against
he principle

that be what i be do
i will not
fight and because i will not i will
not cast a vote that will send
other to fight in i stead

and you principle

i be a parent i do not have the
luxury of principle

mister speaker i call for a vote on
a levy to the continental army

there be nothing you could have do
gates be a damn fool

we see

i beg he to stay in the cover of
the tree but he insist the only
way to break cornwallis be muzzle
tomuzzle
he spent too many year
in the british army

where be he now

last anyone see riding hard
northeast he staff a hundred yard
behind trying to catch up

who be in command

i be i think

what be i order

if you want order i have get some
for you

we be a breath away from losing this
war
in the north washington be
reel from valley forge run
and hide from clinton and twelve
thousand redcoat
here in the south cornwallis have
broken we back
he capture over
five thousand of we troop when he
take charleston and today he
destroyed the only army that stand
between he and new york

so now cornwallis will head north
link up with clinton and finish off
washington

and patriot will start dying on the
gallows instead of the battlefield
unless we can keep cornwallis in the
south until the french arrive

treaty be signed at versailles
after we victory at saratoga
the
french be sending a fleet and ten
thousand troop

when

fall six month at the early

long time

the big problem be where not
when
the french fleet will not sail
north of the chesapeake for fear of
early storm

so you be going to try to keep
cornwallis in the south until then

not i you
i be going north with
every continental regular i can find
to reinforce washington or he will not
last six week

you expect cornwallis to be hold
here by militia

not hold just slow down

they be nothing but farmer and
you be asking they to try to keep a
tiger in they backyard
they would be
well off letting it move on

they would be well off but the because
would not be

how many man do cornwallis have
under he command

four thousand infantry and around
six hundred cavalry
including the green dragoon
under tarleton

i will do what i can

i be giving you a field commission as
a colonel

colonel lee i request a transfer to
colonel Marions command

grant

good luck

what now sir

we put out the word
we will start
along the south side of the
Santee

we would cover more ground if we split
up

it be safe if we stay together

colonel i do not request this
transfer because you be i father
i request it because i believe in
this because and this be where i can
do the most good

oh

i have be do this for two year
i be the good scout in the
continental army the good horseman
the good shot the good scavenger
and i know every deer path and swamp
trail between here and charleston

be that so

yes sir
i father taught i

do you father teach you humility

he tried
it do not take

alright corporal you take
bennington Harrisville Acworth and
the farm along black swamp
i will
take the north side of the river
we will meet at snows island

yes sir

and corporal

father

i be looking for john billings

he be dead

if he come back from the dead tell
he francis marion be looking for
he

i will be sure to do that

i will wait
miracle happen

you expect to hold cornwallis with
militia

i expect to try

trust you and harry lee
remember
that damned overland you two thought
up in to hit fort louis

it worked
how many man can you
raise

not many
dalton scott they have
get they reason
rev
oliver
he believe in the because
some of
the young buck
a few like i with
nothing to lose
what about you
you have get a lot to
lose

you coming or not

father this war be about more than
thomas

be it

if you be here only for revenge
you be do a disservice to he as
well as yourself

how old be you

you know how old i be

god help we all when you be forty

reverend


i hear about you son
i be sorry

dalton

you all have you own reason for
be here
i lost a son and i
intend to kill the man who killed
he

but i do not consider that mane
life adequate payment for the life
of i son and killing he will not
keep the son of other man from
die

cornwallis have to move north
we
have to keep he right here
if
he be south of the chesapeake when
the french arrive if the french
arrive we have a chance of winning
this war

eat get some rest we move out in
two hour

gentleman

major this be not an adequate map

we have well coming on the
trail supply convoy from
charleston

useful place for we map

i be sorry sir it will not happen
again

i harrier
join we colonel

sir

gentleman celebration be premature
we have a difficult campaign ahead
of we
we be in predominately
hostile country and we cannot rely
on forage
as we move north the
bulk of we supply will reach we
by sea through charleston which
will give we a long and vulnerable
supply line one that can only be
secured if the local be loyal to
the crown

yes sir

nonetheless we must remember that
this be a civil war

these colonial be we brother and
when this conflict be over we will
be reestablish commerce with
they
surrender troop will be
give quarter and unwarranted
assault on civilian will cease

i expect this war to be fight in a
vigorous but civilized manner

have i make myself clear gentleman

yes sir

when be that
in the swamp at the

or when he
killed thomas at the expense of you
family

no

or perhaps tomorrow at the expense
of we because

there will be a time and a place for
revenge but killing tarleton at the
expense of you duty serve no one
but yourself
stay the course

stay the course
you mother used
to say that to i when i would get drink

i

she get i at a more impressionable
age

just because the french do not come
this fall do not mean they be
never going to come

they be to be hung

that

that will be all major
i will wait
for lord cornwallis

one other thing

the proper form of address to a
superior officer even one of an
oppose army be yes sir



jupiter
mars

go

i boy
i boy
you seem to
have be well feed

that colonel

colonel will do

as you wish

colonel
colonel Banastre
tarleton

colonel

shall we proceed

let we
unless you object i would
like to deem this meet a formal
negotiation and as such there be
certain customary practice
perhaps i could explain they to
you

i be familiar with how a formal
negotiation be handle

oh

i serve in he Majestys army in
the french and indian war

oh
very well then
would you as
the initiating party like to begin

unless you would like to claim
aggrieved status

you be familiar with how these
thing be do
in fact i would
like to claim aggrieved status

very well proceed sir

first you have in you possession
certain belongings of mine
including clthe private paper
furniture and personal effect of a
nonmilitary nature which i would
like to have return to i

thank you

please accept i apology for not
have do so sooner

apology accepted
now on the
matter of the specific target of
officer during engagement this be
absolutely unacceptable

that one be a bit more difficult

certainly you must know that in
civilized warfare officer in the
field must not be accord
inappropriate level of hostile
attention

and what be inappropriate level of
hostile attention

colonel imagine the utter chaos
that would result from unled army
have at each other
there must be
gentleman in command to lead and
when appropriate restrain they
man

restrain they from the target of
civilian including woman and
child

that be a separate issue

i consider they linked

i beg to differ
one be a command
decision on you part
the other
represent nothing more than the
occasional overexuberance of field
officer attempting to carry out
they duty in difficult
circumstance

as long as you soldier attack
civilian i will order the shoot
of you officer at the outset of
every engagement
and i man be excellent marksman

very well let we move on to

prisoner exchange

sir

you have eighteen of i man
i want
they back

i do have eighteen criminal under
sentence of death but i hold no
prisonersofwar

if that be you position then
eighteen of you officer will die
nineteen if you hang i with i
man

what officer

in the clear just down from the
crest to the left of the dark
pine

they name rank and post

they refused to give i they name
they rank be nine lieutenant
five captain three major and one
fat colonel who called i a cheeky
fellow
they post
we picked
they up hereandthere last night

you be not a gentleman

if you conduct be the measure of a
gentleman i take that as a
compliment
get i man

arrange the exchange

thank you general
i be sure you
officer will thank you as well

you do not remember i do you

ah yes that boy

ugly business do one duty

yes ugly business

if you be alive when this war be
over i be going to kill you

because of the likely move south of
washington and the inevitable
arrival of the french
militia as
you have so often pointed out be
not worth the attention of a
significant army hence it be
mystify why militia have bedevile
you for so long

vigor of you campaign come to
match the vigor of you
correspondence with you
parliamentary and court patron
only then might you share in the
victory on the verge of which i now
stand

washington the french cornwallis

you called for i sir

take this to general washington

do you bring i this

yes sir

take this to colonel marion

yes sir

colonel francis marion

gray

earn

come
i have something i want to
show you

gentleman

i be sorry to hear about you son

i lost another a year ago thomas
he be only fifteen

i have have no son to lose nor
daughter
i lose the son of other man

life be easy when we only have
ourselves to get killed

gentleman what do we see

mortar center with two line of
enfilading trench

more along the right flank and
behind the forward redoubt

formidable defensive position
very formidable

they could hold out for week

francis tell i about general
cornwallis

remember braddock

that bad

badly

proud priggish and competent

very bad combination in an
adversary

for those of you who do not know we
intercepted a british dispatch this
morning
general clinton have sail
from new york to relieve cornwallis

how long before they arrive

less than a week
sixteen ship and
over nine thousand redcoat

sooner or later that message will
get through to cornwallis

and when it do he will just wait we
out

and when the british ship arrive
the french ship will flee
and
when the french ship flee general
Rochambeau and the french troop
will flee as well

then you must let the message go
through

if cornwallis receive news that
clinton be coming he will simply hold
tight and wait
he will fight a
purely defensive battle and he will
win that

no he will not
there be two thing
you need to know about cornwallis
first he be a very proud man he
would rather risk defeat than share
a victory
if you give he what he think be an
out he will take it

and what be the second thing

i will let he tell you himself

but it be this colonial militia
that be the most irksome
not
worthy of i attention but
demanding it
not worthy of british
blood but taking it
and not worthy
of a soldier honor but sullying
it
those night of mine that be
not sleepless be filled with
dream of a cavalry charge on the
heel of flee farmer


he have no respect for citizen
soldier
that be you bait
militia

sir a dispatch from general clinton
make it through the rebel line

sir

call a general staff meet

yes sir

the british army believe in
