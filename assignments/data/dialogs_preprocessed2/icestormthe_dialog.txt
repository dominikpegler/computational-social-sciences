in issue number of the
fantastic four published in
november reed richards have to
use he antimatter weapon on his
own son who Annihilus have turn
into a human atom bomb
he son be
the result of richards couple
with the earthling sue storm and
the problem be that the cosmic ray
that infuse richards and the rest
of the fantastic four on they
abort moon mission have make
young franklin a volatile mixture
of matter and antimatter



and that be what it be to come from
a family if you analyze it
closely
each of they be negative
matter for the other one
and
that be what die be die be
when you family which be in fact
you personal negative matter from
which you emerge it be when the
family take you back thus hurl
you back into negative space



so it be a paradox the close
you be draw back in the far
into the void you be throw

arise and shine young hood

i hope you changed the water in
that bong from last night

the water as you call it be a

Libbets

what dostoyevsky be saying here be
that to be a christian be to
choose because you have to choose
of you own choice but since you

that would be too rational you have
to choose to be bad it be
existential

something
you and i exist on two opposite
side of a great existential
divide that be you pathetic
virginity on the one hand and i
astonishing number of sexual
conquest on the other
i be off to
get laid
see you

flame on asshole

and remember with you erogenous
zone lubricated as such with the
mighty herb do not attempt
terrestrial contact with member of
the opposite sex because you

you be
stuff you keep babbling about
you say so yourself
i have be all
ear for about ten year now on his
subject and

and you have not moved out yet
it be because you be too lazy ben
too scare or lazy to either deal
with we or simply make a decision

elena

sleep in the study
please

good night

good night

but what exactly be stagflation
this mixture of inflation and
stagnation and how should we in
the security industry understand
and accommodate it
well and i
hope i be not out of bound here
think of the money supply as a
large male organ continuously
inflate and yet the societal
vaginal cavity simply want more
as the vicious circle of high
return without real satisfaction
continue the moneyorgan may seem
to be in demand but in fact even
the most inflate capital be
unwanted
this be why i suggest
that while we engage this mawing
abyss for the high return we
at the same time fantasize so to
speak of the safe harbor of
capital appreciation

brilliant brilliant

hey there Benjie you be becoming
quite the inhouse philosopher

it be be a tremendously
transformative year maybe a
little controversial of course but
we be breaking down the old
unitarian barrier

i suppose i reluctance be the
group aspect of it i have never
be much of a joiner although i
still consider myself a somewhat
religious person

well i of course flatter myself
that we church be not exactly what
most people would call organized
religion at time it be the
disorganization that be liberate
and of course i have begin to
minister much more in what one
might call therapeutic
environment in small group and
one on one couple

i daughter
i have not be on a
bike for year
still not really looking
at he
when be the last time you ride a

golfing to i be something i be
suppose to enjoy and i be on the
goddam golf team in college so
it be something one would assume i
do well i used to do well but
basically these day golfing for i
be like hoeing or plow

it be like farm
i be basically
chewing up large tract of
expensively landscape scenery with
overpriced stick and george clair
have obviously in the mere two
year since he joined the firm he
have obviously be taking secret
lesson with a golf pro and i
assume the entirety of he
disposable income have be devote
to humiliate i on the golf
course
and the guy talk
incessantly throughout the
entirety of the miserable hole
on topic that be the suppose
domain of i department

ben

you be boring i
i have a husband
i do not particularly feel the need

can not wait to see how it fit in
with all the other instrument

the halfords have invited we again
this year

you want to go

what do you think

well it be a neighborhood
tradition

i be uh going to bed

so early

rough day
good night

be that a new aftershave

oh yeah
musk or something
you
like it

hmm
good night

mikey

yeah

geometry

sure anything but this english

why be you so good at math but not
in english

i be not good at math
just
geometry

draw out he example
on a piece of paper
it be like you know when they say
two squared
and you think it
means time equal
but
really they really mean a square

square with a side of two
and the
area of the square be four
like
every time you use the word like
squared or cube it be really
space it be not number it be
space
and it be perfect space but only in
you head because you can not draw a
perfect square like in the
material world but in you mind
you can have perfect space
you know

yeah
but i just need some help
with i homework

hey guy i be back

you be go

a look of
disappointment
yeah mikey
yep i be in houston
working on some great new idea
about silicon which come from
sand very conductive
how you guy
do
how be school

uh i dunno
i guess

hmm
alright

you really do not notice
man he be
be go for three day

good trip

you bet

jesus jim

jumping up which only
create another wave
sorry honey
hell we have get to
trade this thing in for a normal
bed

just be careful

you notice anything with mikey
lately
the kid seem a little out
of it tonight eh

tonight
jim he be be out of it
since he be born

hell i guess he take after i
huh

in many way the churchbound
tradition of the father son and
holy ghost be simply a version of
the parentchildadult triad within
we all
it be a primitive set of
symbol for we inner psychology

you be saying that christ be the
child and

and god the angry parent and
the spirit the hope of an
integrate adult self

all well and good but tell i
again what be it exactly that you
believe in

you ask what the point be

that be right

Selfrealization
minister to
help people reach they full
potential
would you believe i if
i told you i want you to see
yourself reach you full
potential and selfrealization

i would say it sound like you be
trying to get i into bed

if that be a potential you see
yourself fulfilling
i mean
i i sound a bit

i be sorry
that be stupid of i
i
do not mean to be so rude

you be not
you actually for some
reason you have the effect on i
of making i feel just a tiny bit
ashamed of myself

but not too ashamed

now you be be rude

and you be still trying to get i
into bed

ouch

hello you two
be i barge in on
some kind of religious study group
elena you look marvelous
will i
see you and ben at the halfords

i suppose we will make an appearance

and reverend edwards
do you make
the list

i believe so mrs
franklin

with the two of you there it will
be positively a revival
i be off

i be afraid she be something of a
gossip be not she

gathering she thing to
go
i be afraid people around here
provide she with quite a bit to
gossip about
take care

that i will indeed

because of molecule we be
connected to the outside world from
we body
like when you smell
thing because when you smell a
smell it be not really a smell it be
a part of the object that have come
off of it molecule
so when you
smell something bad it be like in a
way you be eating it
this be why
you should not really smell thing
in the same way that you do not eat
everything in the world around you
because as a smell it get
inside of you
so the next time you
go into the bathroom after someone
else have be there remember what
kind of molecule you be in fact
eat

it be not the tax i object to
it be all the fine and penalty

alright dad
but you sold the
house you do not tell anyone
including the and i would of
certainly liked to have see if
there be any old stuff

it be all junk

oh
elena wanted to know when we
could expect you on thanksgiving
it be just going to be you this
year

ben i be going to florida
i hate
thanksgiving and i hate the cold
i
have a new nurse
she be a negro
she weigh three hundred pound
and i have decided to leave i entire
estate to she

what

jesus benjamin you be still as
gullible as ever

that be a joke
you do not tell
joke

i think i would start trying
if you
do not mind
