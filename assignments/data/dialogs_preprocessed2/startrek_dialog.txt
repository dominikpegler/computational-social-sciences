eye wide Ayel turn to nero still stare at Spocks image

commander nero we be surround
finally nero look up

sir what be you order
and we as we then we



a young
year old

he be
standing in an abstract space and
question that he be answering as they appear then disappear

what be the square root of

onethousandfivehundered
fortyeight
correct
what be the
central assumption of quantum everything that can happen
cosmology
do happen in equal and
parallel universe
correct
identify the th
century earth composer of the
follow musical progression
paul mccartney and john
lennon
correct
and we find then all in these
odd space until we to reveal a large vulcan
white bowl sunk into the dark ground
where walk hand behind they back surveying this
mass mental martial art test
we be on as she get an answer wrong

then who
get an answer wrong and
an
reveal as the



until only one bowl remain
Spocks
he finish he last
question
get it right
as the

you score be onehundred percent
congratulations
spock
off he face we as spock collect his
thing
as he do three young walk up behind
he
spock glance at they then back to he thing

i presume you have prepared new insult for
today

you mother lie with many man
spock just
try to ignore the fact that

i have no such information

you be neither human nor vulcan and
therefore have no place in the universe

this be you thirtyfifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from i
logic dictate you would cease by now

look
he have human eye
they look sad
do not they

perhaps an emotional response require
physical stimulus
and bully spock who stumble back almost falling
into one of the bowl
he look up as

he be a traitor you know
you father
for marry she
spock stare we see he fighting the urge but he be unable

they
land inside spock cry flail as he punch bully
the other two stand atop the bowl stunned shock unsure
what the hell to do and we



spock chasten sitting glumly on a bench
massive
see through the window behind he
he parent
at a distance down the hall

where i be from when
someone hit you you hit back
how be that not logical
spock have no reasonable
they pick on he they expectation of be
tease he every day
physically injured
which be precisely when
reason must guide he action
i want he to embrace above all
vulcan you know that
but
he have to be himself which
means occasionally be he humanity be very the
human
source of he ostracism
when vulcans get disgust
with each other they never
just walk away do they
no
well human do
and amanda walk away leaving Sarek standing there
he turn
see he son down the corridor
approach
and we be
on spock study the fear in he eye
he father stop in
front of he looming there looking down stoically

i do not mean to create conflict between
you and mother
after a beat Sarek seem to soften a little
no anger in his
face
take a seat beside he son

in marriage
conflict be

constant

natural
emotion run deep within we race
in
many way more deeply than in human
long ago they nearly destroyed we
that be why we follow the teaching of
Surak
now you must choose

between you and mother




never i son
but you may choose the
ethic of logic
logic offer a serenity
human seldom experience
the control of
feeling
so that they do not control
you

they called you a traitor
you suggest that i should be completely
vulcan
and yet you married a human
why
Sarek be clearly conflict by this
but he hold steady

as ambassador to earth i duty be to
observe and understand human behavior
marry you mother
be logical
spock
you be fully capable of choosing
you own destiny
the question you be
face with
be which path you will
take
this be something only you can
decide


a door open
yearold
angrily exit
the house carrying a duffel
he angry redneckier
follow
yearold nervously pursue they

go ahead
go run away

no
way



jim be now officially and he a

the cop through it in the corvettes
and we on a that read

in fact


we see the hundreds of foot deep and
to the corvette and cop speeding toward it


this be where he be be
headed all along and for a moment we think holy shit this
be how james kirk die
he speed toward the edge
but at the last second kirk the brake the
car and he

falling
the
come to a in of as the corvette

the angry cop hop off he hovercruiser hand on weapon as jim
kirk out of breath exhilarated get to he knee

what be you name son
and as he stand we on he and damn if
that kid do not have a swagger
it be like the first time he be
ever stand in he life

i name kirk
james tiberius kirk
and as we we


as an intelligent bi
pedal but with be onto the
wet pavement a under he chin then

brutal guttural



you say they be not yours
the scary four of they
standing above the alien chilling hide they hideous
face and one hold a

these federation map we find in
you pocket




i speak the truth
i do

then who be they for

you would rather die then tell we









i have come far to meet you
the one
who do not speak
ten year be a long
time to maintain silence
perhaps you simply do not speak klingon
just as i do not speak romulan




but i assume we both speak the language
of we common enemy

we find this book in you cell
cartography mathematics what do these
mean
this date here eleven year
from now what happen then
hold up the

and why attempt to smuggle in map of
federation space

when you be capture we assumed you
be a spy send from romulus to surveil
the empire
but because the romulan
deny you existence i believe you be
much more than that

you ship remains in orbit above we now
we have be asking for it secret for too
long
that be why i be here
we want to
know how it work and i believe now
finally
you will tell we

Centaurian slug
they native planet be
in constant sunlight
as a result
there be nothing they hate more
than
darkness




they try to claw and bite they way out
of any dark space they be in




spock come here let i see you



no

spock

there be no need to be so anxious
you will do fine

i be hardly anxious mother
and fine have variable definition
fine be unacceptable




may i ask a personal query

anything

should i choose to complete the vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr
and purge all
emotion
i trust you will not feel it
reflect judgement upon you
she stare at he moved
touch he face

as always
whoever you choose to be
you will have a proud mother
on mother and son world apart but forever bond


an impose yet
spock stand before
the
among face on the dais
he
seated beside the and other

you have surpass the expectation of
you instructor
you final record be
flawless
with one exception
i see you
have applied to starfleet as well

it be logical to cultivate multiple
option

logical but unnecessary
you be hereby
accepted to the vulcan science academy
distinction all the more significant
given that you will be it first half
human pupil
it be truly remarkable
spock
that you have achieve so much
despite you disadvantage
welcome to
the academy
they all start to rise
but spock be suddenly unsettle

if you would clarify minister what
disadvantage be you refer to

you human mother



as the council disperse we on Spocks face the same
look he have when he take punch as a kid
he glance at his
father to say something but Sareks the consummate diplomat
he eye command
remain calm
spock
then make
the first spontaneous human decision of he life

council minister
i must decline
everyone
solid
confuse look turn cold

no vulcan have ever decline admission to
this academy

then as i be halfhuman you record
remains untarnished

spock
you have make a
commitment to honor the vulcan at the moment father i can
way think of no great way to
honor we race than to attend
starfleet as it first vulcan

why do you come before this council
today
be it to satisfy you emotional
need to rebel

i come with the intention of enrol
as i father wished
however you
insight have convinced i otherwise
therefore the only emotion i wish to
convey be gratitude
thank you
minister for you consideration
live long and prosper
he look to he father whose disappointment be evident
still god bless he spock walk out

hey i think you be going to be in

i be suppose to be but it be crazy i
picked up an emergency transmission from
a klingon prison planet there be an
escape and a ship stolen from th
you okay

yeah be running simulation all week
just catching up on some rest
tired
that be all
Uhura watch she
she eye narrow

be you running simulation with the
mouthbreather hide under the bed
Gaila freeze catch
Uhura look down kirk

you hear be scary you sure both
you parent be human

anything else




how the helled that kid beat you test

i do not know




james
kirk
step forward

an incident have occur today that
concern the entire student body
academic immorality by one be an assault
on we all
it will
not
stand
cadet
kirk evidence have be submitted to this
council suggest you violate the
ethical code of conduct pursuant to
regulation
of the starfleet code
be there anything you care to say before
we begin

yessir
i believe i have the right to
face i accuser directly



president nod toward the assembly

he and kirk
for the first time
it be clockstopping

step forward please
this be commander
spock one of we most distinguish
graduate
he be programme the kobayashi
maru test for the last four year
spock step up to the
president nod

cadet kirk
it be obvious you somehow
managed to install and activate a sub
routine in the program code thereby
changing the condition of the test
we happen to find in the crowd fucking pissed

you point be

in academic vernacular you cheated

respectfully
define cheating

to deceive by trickery

now let i ask you something i think we
all know the answer to
the test be
rig be not it
you programme it to
be unwinnable

mr
kirk i do not see how the intent of
the exam be relevant to these
proceeding

because if i be right sir then the test
itself be a cheat

you argument preclude the possibility
of a nowin scenario

i do not believe in nowin scenario



amongst the officer in attendance
he eye locked
on kirk
this be he boy
he recruit
and he be

then not only have you violate the
rule you have failed to understand the
principle lesson

please enlighten i

you of all people should know cadet
kirk captain cannot cheat death

the first punch by spock that landed
the cockiness
slip away as he sense where this be going

i of all people


you father lieutenant george kirk have
assume command of he vessel before
killed in action do he not
shit
the card
kirk a mix of and

how long do it take you to look that up

how long do it take you to program the
virus that allowed you to cheat
the president smirk
consider ending this now but do not
it be just too damn entertain

maybe you just do not like that i beat
you test

i be vulcan
like be not a verb in we
vernacular
i have simply make the logical
deduction that you be a liar

what an idiot i be for taking that
personally

agreed
furthermore you have failed to
divine the purpose of the test




enlighten i again

the purpose be to experience fear
fear
in the face of certain death
to accept
that fear and maintain command of one
self and one crew
this be a quality
expected in every starfleet captain
kirk absorb that
then

so you be telling i the point
of the
whole thing
be to be afraid

fear be necessary yes

have you taken the test commander Spork

spock
as a vulcan i require no
additional train to control i
narcissism when making command decision
no he
kirk hit guy for a lot less the crowd all
but OOOOOOHs
but kirk be not fucking do yet

you keep remind i that you be vulcan
and i be sure you be really proud of that
who would not be but be not it true you
people do not experience fear at all

he raise that eyebrow
and kirk see
no matter
how subtly
that he have fucking make
smell blood


and if that be the case what be that say
about you ability to make command
decision
well
look like kirk just hit he in fuck weak spot
and before this lovefest can continue



burst into the kirk turn to look they
all do now we be behind the who run to
the president hand he a
president read it
everyone watch on edge finally quietly

we have received a distress call from
vulcan

probation pending the result of you
hear
cadet report to shuttle
hangar one immediately this hear be
at recess until far notice
dismiss
everyone on they foot kirk suddenly

heart rate down

computer locate crew member Uhura

i have not see a reaction this severe
since med school

station twelve deck four

we be flying into a trap

you be delusional you know that




come here jim do not move

ow
stop it

the transmission from the klingon prison

cadet kirk i think you have have enough
attention for one day dr
mccoy
return to medical we will have word
later

yessir

listen to i
it be an attack

fact
the same anomaly a light
storm in space that we see today also
occur on the day of i birth before a
romulan ship attacked the you


kelvin
you know that i read you dissertation
which be good




fact
this ship which have formidable
and advance weaponry be never see
or hear from again fact
the kelvin
attack take place on the edge of klingon
space and at hundred hour last night
there be an escape from a klingon prison
planet Rura Penthe fact
the
escaped prisoner be romulan sir and
it be report that they steal a ship
from the prison dock

and you know of this prison escape how

sir i i intercepted and translated the
message myself
kirk report be
accurate

we be warp into a trap there be
romulan waiting for we i promise you
that

the cadet logic be sound
and lieutenant Uhura be unmatched in
xenolinguistics we would be wise to
accept she conclusion

scan vulcan space check if any
transmission be be make in romulan

sir i be not sure i could distinguish
the romulan language from vulcan

how about you you speak romulan
cadet

Uhura sir
all three dialect




Uhura relieve the lieutenant mr
Hannity hail the you


truman

the other ship be out of warp and have
arrive at vulcan sir but we seem to
have lost all contact

captain i pick up no romulan
transmission or transmission of any
kind in the area
there seem to be
something jamming all communication
around vulcan

into the vulcan atmosphere it signal
appear to be block we communication

aye sir






i be pumped to kick some romulan ass
no
joke


so what kinda combat train you have

fencing

fence










Prejump on one
three two one

good luck





away team enter the atmosphere










i be







i be captain christopher pi

so much for diplomacy



none of this be familiar the interface
the control






the jam signal go
communication be reestablish

transporter control reengaged




chekov run gravitational sensor i
want to know what they be do to the
planet

aye commander Keptin sorry
Keptin



the drill be sabotage sir

launch the red matter
now





kirk to enterprise they just launch
something toward the planet








Keptin
gravitational sensor be off the
scale if i calculation be correct
that pod they launch be create a
singularity
that will consume the
planet

they be create a black hole
at the
center of vulcan

yessir

how long do the planet have

minute sir
i would say minute

alert vulcan command center to signal a
planetwide evacuation all channel all
frequency maintain standard orbit

what
spock wait

where be you going

to evacuate the vulcan high council
they be task with protecting we
cultural history
i parent will be
among they

you can not beam they out

it be not possible they will be in the
Katrik arc i must get they myself




retract the drill let we move out





i


we be






i be trying
i can not lock on you signal








you be moving too fast

no i can do that i

the black hole expanding we will not
reach minimum safe distance if we do not
leave immediately




i
i



i
give i








holdonholdonholdonholdon











compensate gravitational pull and






thank

yeah not a problem

step aside i be going to the surface

the surface of what
you be

be you nut

energize






spock

the planet not safe it have only
second left we must evacuate now



spock to enterprise
take we back now



lock volume transport in



it be okay
to be scare









i be





acting captain log
Stardate

i have assumed command of the enterprise







we have hear no word from captain pike
i
have therefore classified he a hostage
of the war criminal known as nero




nero who have destroyed i home planet
and most of it six billion inhabitant
i estimate no more than ten thousand
survive
while the essence of we culture have be
saved in the elder who now reside upon
this ship
i be now a member of an
endanger species



i be so sorry

what can i do
tell i what you need

i need

i need for we all to continue performing
admirably




hey
listen about what happen at starfleet
the test and everything i know it look
like i be
use you or whatever
and i be sorry
i really be
and
i
just hope you will forgive i

you be not Gaila be you

no

sorry



lieutenant have you confirmed that nero
be headed for earth

they trajectory suggest no other
destination captain

earth may be he next stop but we have
to assume every federation planet a
target

yes agreed but why do not they destroy
we




why waste a weapon
we be not a threat

that be not it
he said he wanted i to
see something
the destruction of i
home planet

and how the hell do they do that by the
way
when do they jump so far ahead in
the arm race

the engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole may
suggest the answer
such technology could
theoretically be manipulated to create a
tunnel through space time

Damnit man i be a doctor not a
physicist be you suggest they be
from the future

that be what he be suggest and i do not
buy it

if you eliminate the impossible whatever
remains however improbable must be
the truth

how poetic

then what would an angry future romulan
want with captain pike

as admiral he know detail of
Starfleets defenses

what we need to do be catch up to that
ship
disable it take it over and get
pike back




fantastic i be in

captain pike left we with standing order
to rendezvous with the fleet on the other
side of the quadrant




we be technologically outmatch in every
way
rescue attempt would be
illogical

illogical you be funny

not to mention we could not do it anyway
Neros ship would have to drop out of
warp for we to overtake they

what about assign engineering crew
to try and boost we warp yield


we must gather with the rest of starfleet
to balance the term of we next
engagement

there will not be a next engagement spock
by the time we have gathered it will be
too late how many planet be you
will to risk
you say he be from the
future
know what be going to happen
then
the logical thing be to be unpredictable

you be assuming nero know how event be
predict to unfold
the contrary
Neros very presence have altered the flow
of history beginning with the attack on
the you


kelvin culminate in the
event of today thereby create a new
chain of incident that cannot be
anticipated by either party

do anyone understand he

an alternate reality




precisely
whatever life we might have
live if the time continuum be
disrupted
we destiny have changed
then

mr
sulu plot a course for the
laurentian system warp factor three

i be instructing you to accept
to the brig you will likely
escape
mr
chekov
have
transportation prepare a
deployment capsule
mr
sulu
escort he out

i be sorry

yeah do not worry ab







you be only the second human i have ever
meet face to face
you must have so many
question for i




i only have one for you
i need the
subspace frequency of Starfleets
border detection grid
specifically
those surround earth

christopher pike captain you


enterprise registry

christopher
beat
hardcore
answer i question

no
you answer for the genocide you just
committed on a peaceful planet

i prevent genocide
where i come from christopher
this
ship be just a mining vessel
i choose a
life of honest labor to provide for
myself
and the wife who be carrying
i child
i sit here now
knowing you as enemy
not just of today
but of tomorrow
i
watch as you federation do nothing
they let we burn to death
as we
planet broke in half

then nero you be confuse
romulus have
not be destroyed
how can you blame
the federation for something that have not
happen

it do happen
i remember it
i
feel
it
then
pain
when i lost she
i promised myself i
would not speak another word until the
day of i retribution
in twenty five
year i forget the sound of i own
voice
but i do not forget the pain
that feel cannot be erase




feel that every surviving vulcan now
share

if what you say be true
you can save
romulus
you have a second chance to

yes which be a gift i will not waste on
mercy
i purpose christopher be not simply to
avoid the destruction of the home i
love
but to create a romulus which exist
free of the federation
only then will
she be saved

then we have nothing more to discuss

it be not the fault of the human race that
starfleet choose earth as it center
you be a more noble race than i fall
cousin
i will take no pleasure in you
extinction

how reassure

the frequency please

christopher pike captain you


enterprise registry




as you wish



computer
where be i

current location delta vega
class
planet unsafe
you have be ordered to
remain in you pod until retrieve by
starfleet authority

bite i how be that


there be







lieutenant log supplemental
i be
preparing a testimonial for i starfleet
court martial assuming there be still a
starfleet left




act captain spock whose only form
of expression apparently limited to his
leave damn eyebrow have marooned i on
delta vega in what i believe to be a
violation of security protocol

governing the treatment of prisoner
aboard a st








the HenGra
notoriously afraid of heat



hey
thank you

jim

how you know i name

how do you find i
do starfleet
know of i presence



i have be
and always shall be
you friend

no i do not know you the only
vulcan i know be not exactly a buddy

you be james
kirk
you father be
george as be you brother
you
mother name be winona you be born
in

stop
please
i do not understand




i be spock
one hundred and thirty
year senior to the vulcan you know

bullshit



it be remarkably please to see you
again
re
vulcan
especially after the event of today

old friend
sir i do not have any idea
how you know what you know
but i do not
know you and if you be spock we be not
friend
you hate i
you maroon i
here for mutiny

mutiny
you be not the captain

you be the captain
pike be taken
hostage

by nero

what do you know about he

he be a remarkably




trouble romulan
please
allow i it will be
easier

what be you do

whispering
a mantra
we mind
one and together
one
hundred and twentyseven year from now
everything end





star in beta quadrant will go supernova
and like a cancer left untreated
it
will grow
and destroy everything





i see the begin of it myself
vulcan
science academy devise a plan to stop
it








we build a ship contain a material
capable of generating the only thing
powerful enough to consume a supernova
black hole





i agreed to pilot the ship
knowing i
would not return
now we see spock prime in a ritual ceremony of a vulcan



i sacrifice in service of all race
seem only logical



unfortunately
before i could begin the
mission
the supernova destroyed
romulus

and suddenly we be as

Neros planet be destroyed

yes
he of course blame we
believe
vulcan allowed he planet to die
which
be hardly the case
let i continue







nero come after i
determined to thwart
i mission
if romulus be allow to
die he said
all planet should share
it fate






i needed an exit
i know if this mission
failed
everyone everywhere
would
lose everything





i realized
a large black hole could
destroy the supernova
small one
could be i escape
could send i back
in time allow i to complete i
mission
so i created a black hole












nero must have understood what i be
trying to do
because he begin racing
for it






nero simply get to it first
how long i
be travelling
i could not tell you
it be timeless
but when i arrive






nero be waiting for i




forgive i
emotional transference be
an effect of the mind meld




so you do feel

Cthia be the stricture that bind we
emotion
but few of we be that
perfectly vulcan

go back in time
you changed all we
live

yet remarkably event within we
timeline characteristic people
seem to overlap significantly
tell i
about the rest of the crew
chekov
Uhura

tactical and communication

sulu

he be the helmsman why

dr
mccoy would assert we meet here
be not a matter of coincidence
but
rather indication of a high purpose

he would call it a damn miracle

yes he would
perhaps the time stream
way of attempting to mend itself
in
both we history the same crew find
it way onto the same ship in a time of
ultimate crisis therein lie we
advantage
we must go there be a starfleet outpost
not far from here




where you come from
do i know i
father

yes
you often speak of he as you
inspiration for joining starfleet

you should know
he proudly live to see
you become captain of the enterprise

captain

ship we must return you to as soon as
possible





warp three
course onefiveone mark
three the laurentian system

you wanted to see i

yes doctor
i be aware that james kirk
be a friend of yours
supporting i as
you do must have be difficult

be you thank i

i be simply acknowledge you
difficulty




permission to speak freely sir

i welcome it

do you
okay then
be you out of you
vulcan mind
be you do the logical
thing
maybe
the right one
debatable
but one thing for damn sure
that kid do not know how to lose
just be not in he
back home we have
a say
if you be going to ride in the
kentucky derby do not leave you prize
stallion in the stable


a curious metaphor doctor
as a
stallion must first be broken before it
can reach it potential

i god man
you could at least act
like it be a hard decision

i intended to assist in the effort to re
establish communication with starfleet
however if crew morale would be good
serve by i roam the hall weep
i will gladly defer to you medical
expertise



i







hello

can i help you

be you the station chief

no
this way

hm

visitor

you realize how unacceptable this be

excuse i

re
the officer
fascinating

what

i be sure it be no you fault and i know
youse lad be just do you job but
could you no have come a wee bit
sooner




six month i have be living on nothing
but starfleet protein nib and the
promise of a real food delivery
six
month boy
it be pretty clear what be
going on here be not it
punishment
ongoing
for something that be clearly
an accident

you be montgomery scott

you know he

yes that be i scotty you be in the
right place be there any other hard
work and equallystarving starfleet
officer around

i

you eat nothing
bean and you be do
for a week i need food
and now you be
here so
thank you
where be it

you be in fact the mr
scott who
postulate the theory of transwarp
beam

yes
that be exactly what i be talking
about
how you think i end up here
i get into a debate with i instructor on
the issue of relativistic physics as they
pertain to subspace travel
he seem
to think that the range of transport
say a roast turkey be limited to a few
hundred mile so i told i instructor
i could not only beam a bird from one
planet to an adjacent planet in the same
system which be no big deal anyway
but if i be so incline i could
actually do it with a lifeform
so i
test it on admiral archers prize
beagle
which
be a mistake

i know that dog
what happen to it




i will tell you when it reappear
Dunno
feel guilty

what if i told you you transwarp theory
be correct
that it be indeed possible
to beam onto a ship that be travelling at
warp speed
and that you only required
the correct field equation to
recrystallize dilithium

i have not be station here that long
if such an equation have be discover
da hear

the reason you have not hear of it mr
scott
be because you have not
discovered it yet

from the future be you
brilliant
they still have sandwich where you be
from
piece and jam
mince n tattie
Cockaleekie soup

what be he talking about

food

allow we access to you shuttle
and i
will show you what a genius you actually
be





she be a wee bit dodgy
shield emitter
be totally banjaxed along wi a few
other thing




rapid
that be impressive

you equation for achieve transwarp
beam

imagine that
never occur to i to
think of space as the part that be moving

point of fact
it do occur to you
extrapolate enterprise course

enterprise
have it maiden voyage
already have it
well you must have do
something right to be assign to that
ship kiddo
she be a well endowed lady
love to get i hand on she ample
nacelle if you will pardon the
engineering parlance

Nows you chance mr
scott

look even if i believe you where
you be from what i have do which i
do not we be still talkin bout
slingshotting aboard while she be going
fast than light
without a proper
receiving pad that be like tryina hit a
bullet with a small bullet wearing a
blindfold
on a horse

i calculate no more than a four meter
margin of error

that be all well and good unless you
rematerialize four meter outside the
ship




agreed
the aft engineering bay be you
good option
a large space and no
unpredictable airlock

you be coming with we right

no jim
i destiny lie along a
different path

you must promise i this

you be telling i i can not tell you i be
following you own order
why not
what happen

trust i
above all
jim this be the
one rule you cannot break
to stop nero
you alone must take command of you ship

how over you dead body

preferably not
there be however
starfleet regulation
yes
i forget what little regard you have
for such thing
state that any
command officer who be emotionally
compromise by the mission at hand
must resign said command

so i need to emotionally compromise you

jim
i just lost i planet
i can tell
you
i be emotionally compromise
what you must do
be get i to show it




hm

aye then
live or die laddie let we
get this over with
he enterprise have a
decent cafeteria i be guessing

you know
coming back in time
changing history
that be cheating

trick i learned from an old friend

live long and prosper





no shit




nononono

like the simulator
manual control enable pressure seal
enable shutdown

turbine shutdown not allow





Keptin we be detecting unauthorized
access to a water turbine control board

bring up video

security this be the captain seal
engineering deck and bring i the
intruder in turbine station three set
phasers to stun






you all right

recover looking
around
nice ship
really

let we get to the bridge



come with i
moon beam




surprise

who be you

he be with i




we be travelling at warp how do you
manage to get aboard this ship

you be the genius you figure it out

as captain of this vessel i order you to
answer the question

well i be not telling
captain

do that frustrate you
i lack of
cooperation
do it make you angry

you be not a member of this ship crew
under penalty of court martial i order
you to explain to i how you beamed ab

do not answer he

you will answer i

i would rather not take side

escort they to the brig

what be it about you spock
you planet
be just destroyed you mother
murdered and you be not even upset




you presumption that these experience
interfere with i ability to command
this ship be inaccurate


and yet you said fear be necessary
for command
i mean do you see that
bastard ship
do you see what he do

yes of course i

so be you afraid or be not you

i will not
allow you to lecture i
about the merit of emotion

then why do not you stop i

step away from i mr
kirk

what be it like
not to feel
anger
or heartbreak
or the need to stop at
nothing to avenge the death of the woman
who give birth to you

back away

you must not feel anything
it must not
even compute for you
you must not have
loved she at all




spock

doctor
i be no longer fit for duty
i
hereby relinquish i command on the
ground that i have be
emotionally
compromise
please note the time and
date in the ship log

i like this ship
it be exciting

congratulations jim
now we have get no
captain and no first officer to goddamn
replace he

yeah we do



thanks for the support




i sure hope you know what you be do

so do i
study chair sit
into mic
attention crew of the enterprise
this
be james kirk





mr
spock have resigned commission and
advance i to acting captain
i know
you be all expect to regroup with
the fleet but i have ordered a pursuit
course of the enemy ship to earth




i want all department at battle station
and ready in ten minute
either we be
going down or they be
kirk out

i want some answer




right now
where the helled you get
transwarp technology

yeah you know that be complicate

do i look simple to you

i be a phd in astrophysic i think i can
handle it how do you get back

you vant we to trust you but you von
tell we the truth

no
no i will not hey i be the captain
now
i do not have to tell you anything
now listen
we need to figure out a way
to catch up and get to Neros ship

there be not a chance
they be going to be
in geosynchronous orbit around earth in
ten minute
we will never make it

even if we could you can not go in gun
blaze not with they technology
that be suicide

then we find a way to get on that ship
and steal the black hole device away from
they

well you can forget transwarp
no way to
predict the Naradas position from here

Uhura
anything from captain pike

no
i have be monitor all channel






you must not punish yourself
speak you mind spock

that would be unwise

what be necessary be always wise

i feel as conflict as i once be
as a
child
have i make so little progress

you will always be a child of two world
i be grateful for that
and for you
and not only because you be all i have
left of she

i feel anger
for the one who take she
life
an anger i cannot stop

i believe she would say
do not try to
you ask i once
why i married you
mother
i married she because i loved she



Keptin kirk
excuse i plee could
i




yes chekov you do not need to ask
permission to

base on the Naradas course from vulcan
i have projected that nero will travel past
saturn
if we could drop out of warp
behind one of Saturns moon say titan
the magnetic distortion from the planet
ring will make we invisible to Neros
sensor
we could follow he to earth by
staying in he blind spot

what blind spot

it exhaust wake
if we adjust we
shield frequency they should not detect
we

wait a minute anyone understand this
kid
how old be you

i be seventeen sir how old be you

we be all old enough to shave here



doctor
mr
chekov be correct

i have review he telemetry
if mr
sulu can maneuver we into position i can
beam aboard Neros ship

i will not order you to do that mr
spock

romulan and vulcans share a common
ancestry
we cultural similarity will
make it easy for i to access they
ship computer to locate the device
beat
a flicker of
emotion




also i mother be human
which make
earth the only home i have left




then i be coming with you

i would cite regulation but i know you
will simply ignore it

see we be get to know each other





the man and i have discuss this
what
we be about to do
we have to turn the ship around
we can
save we home

stop




we can go back
that be what we want
we
have taken we vengeance on vulcan
no
more
we want to go home now

there be no need Ayel
to threaten i
i understand

i understand
but you be wrong

we will return to romulus when the
federation lie in ruin and not a moment
before
when those who watch we
people burn at last understand we pain
we loss
i refuse to return as a slave
we will return as conqueror

deploy the drill



you




mr
chekov transfer manual control to
the captain chair




aye
i have projected the parabolic course you
must follow
if you deviate by so much
as a meter we will be detect

give i one quarter impulse burst for
five second and i will do the rest with
thruster
on i mark
three
two
one
fire

you




you




all stop in three
two
one





transporter room
we be in stable
geosynchronous orbit behind the Narada

no sign they have detect we



well do mr
sulu




whatever happen mr
sulu if you feel
you have a tactical advantage fire on
that ship
even if we be still aboard
it be an order

yessir
good luck

we will be monitor you frequency

thank you Nyota

she first name be

i have no comment on the matter

if there be any common sense to they ship
design i will be puttin you in a cargo
bay should not be a soul in sight

energize






mine have a gun

i be trained in the vulcan martial art of
Suus Mahna

i be unable to meld with these romulan
there be subtle difference in they
physiology i do not anticipate

longer a threat

what be you computer access code









the plasma drill be repaired and fully
deploy

good
let we begin










they have activate the drill

communication and transporter
inoperative

they be on they own now



what you refer to as the red matter
device be in the main hangar and i have
locate captain pike

be he alive

unknown

let we move






voice print and face recognition analysis
enable

spock you will be pilote the ship alone

which may be problematic as i be
unfamiliar with this ship design

welcome back ambassador spock

wow
that be weird

computer
what be you manufacture
origin

Stardate commission by the vulcan
science academy

it appear you have be keeping rather
important information from i

just trust i
can you do that




i will get pike









primary core rupture warp engine off
line



someone have detonate weapon in the main
hangar

restore power
engage auxiliary system









the drill be severed

ambassador Spocks ship have be stolen
as be heading out of the solar system

who be

spock

nice time lieutenant

never beamed two target from two place
onto the same pad before
that be
pretty good

we be going to need gastric stimulator
let we prep he for surgery now



nero it be the enterprise







Keptin
the enemy ship be losing power
it shield be down




hail they now

this be captain james
kirk of the
you


enterprise you ship be
compromise too close to the
singularity to survive without assistance
which we be will to provide

captain what be you do

we show they compassion it may be the
only way to earn peace with romulus
it be logic spock
i think you would like
that

no not really not this time

i would rather suffer the death of
romulus a thousand time than accept
assistance from you

you get it
lock phasers
fire everything we have get



you




kirk to engineering
get we out of here
scotty



you bet you ass captain




forgive i
romulus





be not



we be

it be







i be she be

she be be not





i can not














father

i be not
we father

fascinating

there be so few vulcans left
we cannot
afford to ignore each other

then why do you send kirk aboard when
you alone could have explain the truth




because you needed each other
opposing
yet complimentary opposite
it be that
balance between we i should say
you and kirk that often make the
impossible possible

it be a test

no
he heart heavy
i be in no position to pass judgment
i action have robbed you of much
i
could not also deprive you the revelation
of all you can accomplish together
of
a friendship that will define you both in
way you cannot yet realize

how do you persuade he to keep you
secret

i infer universeending paradox
would ensue should he break he promise

you lie

i imply

gamble

an act of faith
one i hope you will
repeat in the future

the future not what it used to be
in
the face of extinction it be only logical
i resign i starfleet commission and help
rebuild we race




and yet you be in a unique position
you can be in two place at once




i urge you to remain in starfleet
i have
already locate a suitable planet on
which to establish a vulcan colony and
assist in the foundation of a new science
academy

i future cannot be determined by you
past
we be one but not the same

then i ask that you do yourself a favor
put away logic
do what feel right
the world you have inherit live in the
shadow of incalculable devastation
but
there be no reason you must face it alone

as i customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving i will simply say
good luck
