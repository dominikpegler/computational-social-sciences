there be an old joke
uh two elderly
woman be at a Catskills mountain
resort and one of they say
boy the
food at this place be really terrible

the other one say yeah i know and
such
small portion
well that be
essentially how i feel about life
full
of loneliness and misery and suffer
and unhappiness and it be all over much
too quickly
Thethe other important
joke for i be one that be uh usually
attribute to groucho marx but i think
it appear originally in Freuds wit and
it relation to the unconscious
and it
go like thisI be paraphrase
uh
i would never want to belong to any club
that would have someone like i for a
member
that be the key joke of i adult
life in term of i relationship with
woman
tsch you know lately the
strange thing have be going
through i mind because i turned forty
tsch and i guess i be going through a
life crisis or something i do not know
i uh
and i be not worry about age
i be not one o those character you know
although i be balding slightly on top that be
about the bad you can say about i
i
uh i think i be going to get good as i get
old you know
i think i be going to be the
the balding virile type you know as
opposed to say the uh distinguish
gray for instance you know
less i be
neither o those two
unless i be one o
those guy with saliva dribbling out of
he mouth who wander into a cafeteria
with a shop bag screaming about
socialism
annie and i broke up and still can not
get i mind around that
you know
keep sift the piece of the relationship
through i mind andand examining i life
and tryin to figure out where do the
screwup come you know and a year ago we
be
tsch in love
you know andandand
and it be funny i be notI be not a
morose type

we see the fellini film last tuesday
it be not one of he good
it lack a
cohesive structure
you know you get
the feel that he be not absolutely sure
what it be he want to say
course i have
always feel he be essentially aa technical
film maker
grant la strada be a great
film
great in it use of negative energy
more than anything else
but that simple
cohesive core

i ami ami be going to have a stroke

well stop listening to he

you know it must need to have have it
leading from one think to another
you know what i be talking about

he be screaming he opinion in i ear

like all that juliet of the spirit or
satyricon i find it incredibly
indulgent
you know he really be
he be
one of the most indulgent film maker
he
really be

key word here be indulgent

new yorker have to know we rate of
intercourse

therapy you can think of it in term of
how it affect you

gal gunshy be what it be

upper west side of manhattan

over the theater scene and
Annies sing
she have moved back to new york
she be
living in soho with some guy
and when i meet she she be of all thing
drag he in to see the sorrow and the
pity
which i count as a personal
triumph
annie and i
Alvys voice continue over the
scene shoot through a window of
manhattan cafe showing Alvy and
annie sitting at a table laughing
and enjoy themselves
we have lunch sometime after that and
uh just uh kick around old time

after that it get pretty late
and we
both hadda go but it be great seeing
annie again right
i realized what a
terrific person she be andand how much
fun it be just knowing she and
thought of that old joke you know this
thisthis guy go to a psychiatrist and
say doc uh i brother crazy
he
think he be a chicken
and uh the
doctor say well why do not you turn
he in
and the guy say i would but
i need the egg
well i guess that be
pretty much how how i foot about
relationship
you know they be totally
irrational and crazy and absurd and
but uh i guess we keep going through it
because uh most of we need the egg
