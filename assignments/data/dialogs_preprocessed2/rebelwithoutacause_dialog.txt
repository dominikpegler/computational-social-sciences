for many day before the end of we
earth people will look into the
night sky and notice a star
increasingly bright and increasingly
near



as this star approach we the
weather will change
the great
polar field of the north and south
will rot and divide and the sea
will turn warm

the last of we search the heaven
and stand amaze
for the star
will still be there moving through
they ancient rhythm



the familiar constellation that
illuminate we night will seem as
they have always seem eternal
unchanged and little moved by the
shortness of time between we
planet birth and it demise

will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we come



destroy as we begin in a burst of
gas and fire



the heaven be still and cold once
more
in all the complexity of we
universe and the galaxy beyond
the earth will not be missed



through the infinite reach of
space the problem of man seem
trivial and naive indeed
and man
exist alone seem to be an
episode of little consequence
