Kabuo Miaymoto sit with the rigid
grace of a samurai warrior
as if
detached from he own trial

could be
with this jury



Hatsue miyamoto have be without

very bad news to tell

worst
kind of news

carl die last night
in a fish
accident
in white sand bay

no Carls fine h

we find he mrs
heine
tangled
in he net

i told he this could happen

so no
immediate suspicion
no
general talk of enmity
between the two

these be fisherman alvin
they
do not talk at all to each other
and less to i
specially gossip



gillnetter work through black
night with only himself to talk
to
and learn to be silent
they be lonely man and product
of geography



man who on occasion realized
that they wished to speak but
could not

figure you hear by now

you go fish it happen

you see susan marie

she do
jesus christ

excuse i Gjovaag

i do not need to excuse nothing
fuck you anyhow chambers



like the sheriff i do not work
the sea and could never merit trust
or respect

sheriff be askin which boat
follow carl out last night

only to see if somebody talk to
he out th

so who talk to he
out there

so far we figure the guy who go
to ship channel bank be jim ferry
Hardwell moulton miyamoto

jap

all right look if you see these
boy

never see you so hardass art
be not this just an accident

course it be but a mane dead
william
i get to write i report

i be not going to see some article
about an investigation be i

you want i to lie

no i want to be off the damn record
that be what i want

i mean if there be a killer why
would you want he all alert

let we say
someday
i
need some
cooperation from
you
on this thing
do i get it



no sign of a struggle you say

well the coffee cup be layin right
in the
middle
of the floor like i
said
and with a fella so neat as
carl that do seem peculiar

as peculiar as a struggle between
a pound man and an assailant
strong enough to subdue he
that
leaf only a
single
overturned
cup
in it wake



objection asking the witness to
speculate

i gosh alvin be i suppose to
object every time you do that

that be quite enough horseplay
Nels why do not you act you age

if i do that you honor i would
be dead

any more homely loveable trick
and you will be bad than that
proceed gentleman

there be an objection you

and it be overrule answer the
question
if you can recall it

maybe the assailant straighten
the cabin
and forget the cup

right
in the middle
of the floor

maybe

i think you testify
all
the
light be on
cabin mast
net light picking light

yessir there would be real heavy fog

and yet you start the engine
right up
with all those light
draw all night the battery
have that much charge
do that
strike you odd

do not think about it at the time
so no it do not strike i odd

do it now

little
yes
you have to
wonder

you have to wonder

you find three battery you
say
and in the well
and a spare on the cabin floor
correct

it be

now i do some measuring down at
the chandlery
be one inch
wide than a
it would be too
large for the deceased well

he be do some onthespot refit
ting
you could see the side flange
be bang away to make room for
the

but he have a spare you said
right there
why not use that

it be dead
we have it tested
maybe the be the spare and he
have to use it

maybe he carry a spare that
be too large to fit
so he would
have to bang out the flange to
squeeze it in

sheriff how many battery and
what size do you find on
defendant
boat

two s
that be the kind he
well be fitted for

no spare

no

so the defendant go out fish
for the night with
no
spare battery
hmmn

apparently

i be curious
the that be
refit into the deceased well
be it exactly the same brand and
model as defendant

i believe so

now you have testify that the
deceased be a heavy man and hard
to bring out of the net

be it possible he head strike the
transom or the stern gunnel or the
net roller as you be bringing he
in

i do not think so

you do not
think
so

he be heavy but we be real
careful
but i do not remember he
hitting anything anywhere

you do not
remember

operating this winch you would rarely
operate before do this awkward
job of bringing in a drown man of
pound
be it
possible
possible
that he strike he head
after
death
possible

possible
but not darn likely

no far question

so when the sheriff return
you show he the injury to the
deceased head

he said could it be somebody hit
he
and i said you want to play
sherlock holmes here


do you say more

i said that if i be playing sherlock
holmes
i would maybe look for a
japanese person
with a bloody gun
butt
righthanded fella to be
precise

and why
be that

well i be a doctor in the jap
theater in the war
i see those
kendo wound
many
time
look
exactly like this one

could you tell i what kendo be

japanese stickfighting
they be
trained as kid know
to kill
with stick



no far question

hip stomach
cut
stomach muscle
tighten as stroke advance

elbow soft or there be no follow
through
you cut you bokken off
from the power of you body unl

hip sink more
less weight on the
heel so tha

Zenshin
be constant awareness
of dang

elbow soft
little good

you can be good with the bokken
if you begin to concentrate

you must choose now Kabuo
at eight
year
if you want this

i
want
it

then speak quietly
so you may be
hear



so this
foam you find in the
lung
how do it get there

as i testify
it occur when
water mucus and air be mixed by
respiration
i believe i said that

but a drown person can not breathe

of course not
the foam mean
that he go
in
breathe

that be
why
the autopsy report
identify
drown
as the because
of death

meaning that he be not murdered
first say on the deck of the boat
and then throw overboard

well

you report say death by
drown

which mean he go into the water
alive and breathe
and the report
be accurate

of
course
it be accurate but

of course it be
now as to the
head injury
you say make by an
object narrow and flat
that be
you
inference
correct

it be i
job
to infer that be what
coroner do
you get hit with a
crowbar or a ballpeen hammer or
fall off a motorcycle the injury
look different that be i area of
expertise

in you motorcycle example
those
injury be produced by the head
be propel
against
an object
rather than the reverse yes

obviously

can you tell whether an object moved
against the head or the other way
around
or would both look the same

the same

so if he head strike something
narrow and flat the gunnel of a
boat a net roller a fairlead
could that have

if the head be moving fast enough
but i do not see how it could be

be it possible

sure anything poss

be it fair to say that you do not
know for
certain
which it be

i already said that b

and
that you can not say for
certain
whether the head injury be
sustained before or
after
death

for certain no

but you be
certain
that he die
by drown

for the third time yes

can i say something here

yes you can tell i about the
minor cut you find on the deceased
right hand
the report say recent
origin
how recent
as much as
hour before death

absolutely not
probably one or two
hour
four at the most

be you absol

yes
i be sure

thank you horace
no more
question

we will take we luncheon recess
reconvene at
of the clock sharp

how be the kid

they need they father

well
just a few more day

look arts going to want i t

you look beautiful

i look terrible
do not sit so
straight like Tojos soldier
the
jury will be afraid of you

okay i will hide under the table
from now on
that make you happy

i be not going until you smile

they will hear everything

there must be
something
good on
the radio

would not some
music
be nice

ishmael
see the yellow one

can the music be
louder
please
we can not hear so good in here

have you ever do this

never
you be i only

so right



course we grow up together



she mom have this mrs
Shigemura
come on wednesday
teach she
how to be japanese



dance calligraphy
do she hair
how to sit without moving



she would tell i story of
this woman and she lesson
as
if complaining or at least ex
plaining she world



but i always fantasize
the
lesson be for i


no
you must never look at a man
directly
this be
part
of grace

i do not think the boy on this
island
be impress
by grace


Hakujin know nothing of life Hatsue


this be why they fear death
because
life here be separate from be


it be why they have no soul


life embrace death include it
this truth bring tranquility
you
must see yourself

as a leaf
on a great tree


the pin
could be well place



i lesson come from i father
they
be different
or seem so at the
time



he operate the review alone with
an integrity and passion for principle
that make he a figure of respect
if
slightly large than life



he never speak of wanting i to
succeed he
and in truth it be
the last job on earth i think i would
ever want



when i be five he casually mention
that if he sleeve get catch in the
press he would be instantly pop open
like a childes balloon and splatter
across the wall



even he bone would disappear to
be discover later on the floor
as strip of white confetti



which of course make i certain that
life would have no meaning until i
could run that teakettle



he be for good or bad the
only god in i life
i guess it be
we nature to resent those we know
we can never measure up to



which keep we from accepting
the warmth
the way we should



every summer after harvest the
strawberry festival be dad favor
ite story to cover
good news be
he preference
making he an oddity
among journalist



highlight be crown the strawberry
princess
always a japanese girl
sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
to the concept of racial harmony



senior year
it be Hatsue



she wink at i
in public
which be unusual



i have kiss she once when we
be ten
look at fish through
a glassbottomed box
it be just
an impulse and no big deal

he be still get a good grip
we
need to dig more



at school she keep mostly to the
japanese kid and sort of ignore
i
as if all of we time alone
together
in the hollow cedar
everywhere
be a secret



i told myself that be good
that
it make we friendship special
and
do not mean she be ashamed of it
necessarily

easy
slow be good



i think about she
sometimes
all the time
i know i be unhappy
but i know if i told she



it might be a mistake
i could
never correct

i like you

do you know what i mean Hatsue
i have always like you



i know in i heart that we would
love each other forever



the way she kiss i
she know
it too



she avoid i for a week



so this way i could see she
without
bother anyone



i be certain everything would
work out



and frighten



by two week i know i have make
the define mistake of i life



i would ruined everything

i could take a fish
gaff and split you head open
right above you leave ear

i wanted to live

some colonel come down the beach

disgraced and imprisoned



the captain who follow said shot

i arm be deal with by a
pharmacist mate whose surgical
career be four hour old

the way i finger curled
against the wall



fuck goddam jap
bitch



it be all i could think of to say



there be nothing more to say
for a long while

you greatgrandfather be a
samurai a magnificent soldier

he killed himself
on the
battlefield
at Kumamoto

he go to battle with a sword
against rifle mind you
knowing
what honor required

he be angry
to the point of
be crazy yes
but he know
what honor
required

honor can require loyalty
revenge
death

these be safe father
the
hakujin will never f

it be the
only
scale

only scale
in which we worth
be weigh

every life end
and if it end
dishonored
it be as if

we have never live

well this one here come off
Miyamotos boat
match all he
other worn equal and so on
but
this one here

come off third cleat from the
stern port side
and it be brand
new
unlike the rest

and the next one

from carl Heines boat
all he
be like this one threestrand
manila new condition braided in
loop
not bowlined like Miyamotos

and the last

find on Carls boat too
starboard
side second cleat from the stern
but it do not match Carls line
it match Miyamotos
perfect

so if defendant have tied up
to deceased boat
with that
last one
would those cleat
have lined up

you bet
and if miyamoto there
have be in a hurry to cast off
he coulda left this line behind
on Carls boat

and replace it later with the
new one
that be you inference

pretty darn clear

and when you visit defendant on
he boat
the evening after carl
Heines death
do it seem pretty
darn clear to he

cut you engine we be coming
aboard

what for sheriff

we have a warrant
to search
you boat

well what be you looking f

murder weapon
we think you
might be responsible for the death
of carl heine

sheriff if somebody killed carl
it sure as hell be not i

then let we get this over with so
you can get to fishin
now cut
yor engine

you always run with the well open

i be checking the cable

s huh

we will come back let we take a
look at the stern

see you replace a moor line
lately
this one new

naw i have that around for a while

sure you do
help i with this
hold cover willya

there be nothing to see
i need to
get out there fi



art
Looka this

there be blood on it

fish blood i gaff fish with that

you gaff with the
hook
end
blood on the butt
where
you hand go

sure
blood get all
over
you
hand sheriff ask any fisherman

going to have this tested
now you
go home okay
wait til you hear
from i

sheriff i can not afford not to
fish toni

look no way i be lettin you out
there
in a half hour you could
be in canada

i be sorry son
but you be under
arrest



now you testimony be interrupt
yesterday when that power line
set fire to you motherinlaws
farmhouse
really
irritate



how
be
you motherinlaw

she be alright Nels thank
for asking



and she farmhouse

the damage be considerable
but she be insured
thanks again

well just to put it back in
we mind could you repeat what
you told we
about the
type
of
battery you find
one Carls boat

one and one in the well
and a dead on the deck

which you infer be replace by
the which must have be a spare

what else could it be

even though a be too big and
the flange have to be bang out to
squeeze it in
which make it a peculiar choice
for a spare

you
said that
that be
you
testimony

i guess i be a pretty smart feller
after all
and what be the type
battery you find on
defendant
boat

s
like i sa

no far question



so the blood on the gaff be not
fish blood at all
it be
human

yes
type positive


carl Heines type

but you can not say with any certainty
that the blood be his


no but as i say the type be rare
ten percent of caucasian male

and the blood could
not
have
belong to defendant
see
that he type be negative


that be obvious

you scraped the dry blood from
the
butt
of the gaff
where a fella
hand
go
and what do you see under
you microscope besides the positive
blood and the wood scraping


bit of blood and wood
what else
would there be

no bit of bone no particle of
scalp no strand of hair


none

well if the blood get
onto
the
gaff by crushing a mane skull


i be a hemotologist sir i be
ask only t

would that seem
logical


i do not know

you do not

the coroner testify that carl
heine have a cut
fresh cut
probably one or two hour old

on the palm
of he right hand

with no bone or scalp or hair
present
would it be more probable
that the blood come from crushing
a mane skull


i be a hemotologist not a detective

or from the cut on he hand
which be more probable


it be not i function
to weigh
those probability

you be right

that be the jury job

now this regiment you be train
the nd this be all Nisei boy

they be JapaneseAmerican boy
yes sir

and you be generally experienced
in train man for handtohand
combat

it be i specialty sir i trained
several thousand over the year

so
wide crosssection of man to
evaluate
and the day that the
defendant volunteer for this
demonstration
do you find he
eager

more than eager
he be out to
make a point

and what point
be that

anyone



you do not salute i you do not
call i sir soldier i be an
enlist man

and nobody
bow
in this mane
army you be in america son
not japan

i be sorry sir force of habit

no more sir
that be the last
of that

the exercise be avoiding thrust
now first y

ready sergeant

excuse i

be you ready for some simulate
combat soldier

for combat
sergeant

you weapon sergeant

well what then sergeant

what else
i have the boy teach
i kendo
including
the importance
of the bow

and you evaluation of the
defendant
could he kill a much
large man with a fish gaff
so quickly there would be no
sign of struggle

oh in a heartbeat

able and will
like few man
i have ever see

so the plan be for you husband
to fish through the prime season
then in november sell the boat
and you would move onto the farm

that be he plan yes



whatever she said she be hook
star witness
the jury especially
the man would not betray this fine
lady with a not guilty verdict
how
could they face she

can you think back for i to the
morning of september
the day
after you husband purchased the
farm
one
week
before he death
can you recall that morning

i can



what
could
i tell he
there be
i mother to think about
you
know what
she would
say



i said i would think it over talk
with you

do he go away angry

he keep talkin about those seven
acre
belong
to he father and
how
honorable
and
decent
he father
be
he meaning be pretty clear
and i do not much like it

you have a scrap

i could not
talk
to he
look
Kabuos a jap
and i do not hate
jap but i do not like they neither
it be hard to explain if you be not
in the war you know

he be not a jap
you do not mean
that
you and he be friend

we be kid



so you husband said he be think
it over
encourage mr
miyamoto
to believe he might sell to h

i would not say encourage



well he do not say anoa do he
do not say no hope exist

not in those word



so the defendant be encourage
to hope
or could have be

i guess so

i guess you would have to guess
not have be there with they
have to guess whether you husband
report be word for word accurate

carl never lie

of course not
but it be
emotional
friend plea set
against he mother attitude

those dirty look
defendant
ever aim one of those at you

he have no reason to

carl ever say
he
get one

i can not speak for he

you can speak for what he
said
just like you do for mr
hook



objection badger the wi

sorry about that mrs
heine
shall i repeat the ques

carl said he do not like Kabuo
much anymore

the question be more about the
defendant
attitu

that be all he said

and we can not ask he anymore



i father have buy the DeSoto
fifteen year before
driving it
remind i of he
which i
considered a neutral fact



actually it be pleasant



snow make all the field into one
the notion that one man might kill
another for a small patch make no
sense



but i know such thing occur
have be to war and all

may i give you folk a lift



i do not look at she
i think
that would be good

i father be grateful for you
kindness
but he will free his
car shortly

okay i will help

i know it be cause you trouble
but do not you think the snow be
beautiful coming down

yes
very
beautiful

this trial be unfair
you should
write about that in you newspaper

what should i say

just that
this trial be
wrong

they be calling a good man a killer
it be only about prejudice and that
be unfair

we all expect the world to be fair
as if we have some right t

i do not mean everyone
just people
who can do thing because they can
arrest people or convict they
or
run a newspaper

maybe i
should
write a column
what do you think

what do
you
think

i think people
should be fair

will you write that

i might just



i be part of she life again
i
be a person

you have the night watch
on the
radio

since september

sions write they up file they
in a cabinet

all kind

that be a long time ago
what a
child feel

spend the night will you
do not
go back out into all that snow



i feel Milhollands report in i
pocket
and wonder why i be not
telling she
tell someone
what i would find

you have be busy with that trial
i suppose
such a travesty

they only arrest that poor soul
because he be japanese

seattle boy think he be guilty
they
say the evidence be rock solid

they be not he neighbor like
you be
he be a husband a father
he risk his
life
for
they
country
the same as you

those be not the fact that matter

well folk be pretty cold
and folk who believe in nothing
else
they be cold too

i have tried to understand you
unhappiness all these year
have go to war losing you arm

but other boy come back
and
push on
they find girl and
marry have baby

someday i will get lucky too

you father fight at Belleau
wood it take he year to get
over it
nightmare tear b

but he find you

it be not the war ishmael
all
those year growing up
you never
have a real girl of you own

and i know you have it in you
to love
i know that much
i
wish i know more

i will stay tonight
thanks
for asking



i come back from the war to
this room
i stay a few
month
until i father passed

the japanese people of the island
be saddened by this loss
you
father be a man of great fairness
and compassion for other

friend to we
and to all people

well

we know you will follow in his
footstep
and honor he legacy



i think it then
and often since
balance he be say
finding the
fact
that folk needed to know



dear ishmael
these thing be
very difficult to say
i can not
think of anything more painful
than writing this letter

think of reading it



i do not love you ishmael
there
be no more honest way to say it



whenever we be together i know
it
i loved you and i do not love
you at the same moment



the last time
at the cedar tree
i know we could never be right
together
and that soon i would
have to tell you



this be the last time i will write
to you
i be not yours anymore



i wish you the very good
you
heart be large and you be gentle
and kind
i know you will do great
thing in the world



i must say goodbye to you now
we live will move on
the good
we can



Milhollands report be like she
letter
something no one else
would ever read



thing about have only one hand
it be hard to tear page up
and
i be not carrying a match



so i think of i father
the man
who would have taken this report to
judge fielding



but every reporter
choose he own
balance
find the fact that matter



after all the freighter be only
a theory
it prove nothing at
all
there be other fact
that matter



tomorrow i would write a column
about prejudice
and she would
be grateful
for i large
and
gentle
heart



she husband would be judge
and
she would be alone



alone
the past look different

hopeful
be the word i would use

but carl do not say yes

he do not say no
that be Kabuos
point
given how Carls mother
feel carl be
still
willing to
consider selling to we
it be a
good sign

well in the week that follow
the week before Carls death
do you husband pursue he

no
Kabuo do not wish to beg
he respected Carls right to
reflect
he be sure carl would
do the honorable thing

and do he

the night of the th Kabuo helped
carl at sea
with he dead battery

right there on the boat they
agreed
for the seven acre
down
they shake on it
Kabuo
be so excite when he come home

and when do you first learn
that carl have drowned

one of the clock that afternoon from
a clerk at Petersens

you witness

you husband come home agitated
after he encounter with the
deceased

i said excite
not agitated
he be excite in the sense of
be overjoyed

you be
overjoyed yourself to
hear the news

happy for he
and relieve

so then you
and you husband
must have called friend relative
to tell they the amazing news
yes

no

really
do not call you mother
you sister about starting a new
life
you husband never tell
he brother that the family honor
be vindicate

we hear how carl
passed away
only a few hour later

you husband return at what
seven of the clock

closer to eight

so five hour
plenty of time for
a call
he be excite you say
in the sense of be overjoyed

we be
cautious people
you
would say conservative
there
would be time for celebrating
with other when a paper be signed

you think the deceased might
break he promise

of course not
we be just not
quick to run and boast
in case
something go wrong

and then something do
carl
heine be find dead
with he
head crushed

yes and then what be there
to call about
everything be
up in the air

up in the air
be
that
you
reaction

i would suggest that more happen
than a land sale evaporate

man
die
mrs
miyamoto
husband
and father of small
child
have
he
skull
bash in

if you mean to imply that we be
callous about Carls death that be
wrong and insult

i see
well do you come
forward to tell sheriff moran
what you know
the encounter in
the fog the
dead battery be it

we discuss that
and decided
not to

why not

because the fact could be
misconstrue as murder

but if truth be on you side
whatever be you worried about

trial be not only about truth
mr
hook
even though they
should be
they be about what
people
believe
be true

so you hide the truth
deliberately

we be afraid
silence seem
well
to come forward seem
like a mistake

well it seem to i

objection
mr
hook can give
he view in he summation

do not it seem to
you
mrs
miyamoto that you mistake be
in be deceitful
conceal
information during the course of
a sheriff investigation

it seem human
to i

i suppose that you mean this
excuse
conceal the truth
then why
ahouls any of we believe you now

question withdraw you may
step down

you be imply th

i said
no far question

that be enough mrs
miyamoto not
another word
step down please



thirty year fishing alone
ever
have an occasion to board another
mane boat
except
in an emergency
maybe to socialize or some such

never
only boarded some fella boat
five six time in thirty
one
year
dead engine break hip only in need



now mister gi

unwritten rule of the sea
we do not
bother each other stick to ourselves
ask anybody

now if you wanted to kill a man
think you would try boarding against
he will and hitting he with a
fish gaff

it be a joke
Maneuver up to Carls
boat
tie you line fast
come
aboard
all against Carls will
it be the stupide suggestion i
ever hear of

i be sorry about that
it be not
mine in the first place

so the fish gaff method would not
make sense

could not get on the boat
i would
just
shoot
the feller
then
tie
up throw he inta the drink
and
skip bein the first gillnetter
in history to make a successful
force board

now the sheriff believe that the
battery in Carls well be
Carls own spare
even though it
be too large f

no sense to have
any
at all

even the right size
it be like
have an extra battery in the
trunk of you car
nobody do

boat have two battery
lose one
you run off the other til morning
carl musta lost both so miyamoto
there give he one a his

course if carl lost both battery
dead in the water he radio would not
work
so how would he signal for help

compress air horn most likely
hope to god some man hear you in
that fog

all right what if the defendant
hear
so carl
let
he aboard to
help
and
then
the fish gaff

you mean miyamoto follow he out
there and suckerpunched he

well what if

now how be miyamoto going to know
in
advance
that carl lose two
battery
must happen once ever
year or so

thank you mr
gillanders
thank
you for coming down in this cold
weather

well it do seem mighty warm in
here
specially for mr
hook

what if the defendant follow carl
and pretend his
own
battery be
dead
would carl tie up and help

be the word you be groping
for
yes perha



alvin

rephrase
do you agree that he
might tie up to the defendant bo

so why be the in Carls well

who be to say
maybe it be just
a spare after all
or maybe the
defendant
left it as a potential
alibi
in case somebody see he
in ship channel bank
in case we put two and two
together knowing of the hostility
between the family

i question be
could carl have
tied up to help the defendant

it
coulda
happen
and if i start
to say it be doubtful you would probly
say no far question right

right about that
and
right that
it coulda happen

thanks for you help
hope the
witness box be not too warm for
you comfort

but the tough scenario
be the
one hook will never raise

and what be that

that you come upon carl by accident
like you said
give he the battery
like you said
ask he about the
seven acre
like you said

only
he said no

and something
happen
that
you would never planned
because
you be not a coldblooded killer

i be more a hotblooded killer huh
like a soldier
like a samurai

you will not hear that from hook
because the charge be
first
degree
murder which require premeditation
he can not change the charge

so if the jury think you
do
kill
but only in the heat of anger
they
have to acquit

and you could not
be
retry

you want i to say that

i want you
to tell the truth

you think that
be
the truth

i told you wife
trial be not
always so much about actual truth
as about what folk
believe
be true
that be sad
and it be real

and what do you believe

question first
why do you want
to know

because you be i friend

i believe you be a good man
who
belong with he family

and i believe
you do not do it



i battery be draw down both
of they
alternator belt be loose



no sweat
we will pull one a mine
get you start



you lash up a lantern
gainst
a fog like this



lantern and a air horn
that be
all i get without i juice

do not know how long it be take to
get a charge

keep it tonight
we will catch fish
i will see you back on the dock

hold on
you know as well as
i do we get something to talk
about

seven acre
i be wonderin what
you would pay for they
just curious
be all

what be you sellin they for
why do not we start there

do i say i be selling
but
if i be i would have to figure you
want they real bad
Oughta charge
a sall fortune maybe

then again
maybe you would want
you battery back

the battery in that be do
with
besides you would do the
same for m

do the same
i have to
warn you about that chief

for the life of i sir i cannot
imagine
why you keep this story from
the sheriff

as i wife testify we be
consider it

actually she said you have decided
decide
not
not come forward

i be think about it
every
minute

except even when sheriff moran
arrested
you
you said
nothing
about seeing carl

at that point you be
already
under suspicion
the battery story
explain
thing
if the story be
true
and not simply something you
think up later

why
do not you
tell it

sheriff said right off i be
under suspicion
i do not have
a lawyer

but even
after
you have an
attorney
you still claimed to
know
nothing
claim
not
to
have see carl
be i correct

yes
initially

well initially be an interesting
word sir
you would
be
arrested
you
have
a lawyer and you
still
claimed ignorance

i should have tell everything
right away
i know that now
and i regret it

should have tell everything
mean you should have tell
the
truth

nothing to say

i do not know that be a question
it sound like a speech

i apology
do you regret
not telling the truth

i have tell the truth

you mean this morning
the
new story the battery story
that one be the truth
that be
a question sir

yes
and i told it long before
this morning

i see
now what happen the
day carl heine be find
before
you arrest

i sleep til onethirty when i
wife wake i up with the news
we
talk for a few hour
i left at
six and go straight to i boat

do not go anywhere else
no errand
no purchase
just straight to the
boat
that be the truth

yes

well the sheriff find
two
battery
in you well
if you left one with
carl heine how be that possible

i have a spare battery in i she would
i bring it down and put it in
just before the sheriff show up

conveniently in you she would
only
you do not mention that a moment ago
why do this battery story change
every time a new question be raised

you ask if i go straight to the
boat
i do
with the battery

you be a hard man to trust sir
you sit before we with no expression
keeping a poker f



objection

you know good than that mr
hook
either ask question
that count for something or sit
down and be do with it

shame on you

i apologize to the court for
letting i feeling get the
well of i

no other question
we will go to
summation

believe that etta Heines son
would
never
sell he the land
land
that in
he
mind filter through
ancient rule of behavior hand down
from he ancestor culture
belong
to he family by right

he
only
choice to get the land
would be to
eliminate
carl heine
so that ole Jurgensen would need
a new buyer

in he mind
see through code
of revenge difficult for we to
fathom this be also the
only
way
to
avenge
what he feel to be the
grievous
dishonor
bring to his
father he family

to a thousand year of ancestry
in a foreign land we
still
find an
enigma
despite we recent bitter
experience with it way

thus believe coldblooded murder to
be
justified
he trail carl heine
could hear he engine in the fog
and
sound he own horn claiming distress

as carl pulled alongside
please
carl the defendant must have say
i be sorry for what have come between
we but adrift here in the fog i
plead
for you help


and so this good man tied his
boat fast while he enemy
leap
aboard
strike
the treacherous
blow he be trained to strike by
he father hand

the feud over these seven acre
have fester for eight
year
he
argue
with carl about buying the
land
one week
before carl be killed
Carls
skull
be crushed and he
blood
be on a
murder
weapon with which
the defendant be a deadly
expert

and after a series of
lie
the
defendant at last
admit
he be
there
alone on the boat
in
the fog
carl Heines blood on
he fish gaff

i lord
i lord

look clearly at the defendant
see the truth selfevident in he
and in the fact of this case

look into he eye lady and
gentleman consider he face
and ask yourself what you duty
be as citizen of this community



not a
single
witness have testify
to
anything
that could suggest pre
meditated murder
not in the day
before carl Heines death
or at
any
time
have
anyone
described a
murderous rage toward the deceased

etta heine have cheated he family
he have ask he childhood friend
carl to sell he the land
and
carl be consider it

there be
no
evidence of anger at
carl much less
rage
much less
murderous
rage
no
reason
for
premeditation and no
evidence
of
it
anywhere

and yet the state be required to
prove
these thing
beyond

reasonable
doubt

can you seriously think there be
no
reasonable doubt
why be
Kabuos
battery in
Carls
well if carl
be helping
he

why be not the blood on the gaff
more
consistent with Carls
hand
wind than a
skull
fracture
given
the absence of bone or brain tissue

what mr
hook ask you to believe
be that
no
proof be needed
against
a man who bombed pearl harbor

look at he face the prosecutor said
presume that you will see an enemy
there
treacherous by nature by a
thousand year of something or other

an argument i find as despicable as
it be dishonest and twist and
insult
to we all
mr
miyamoto
be a
much
decorated
hero
of the united
states army
for god sake

if someone said you should convict
carl heine
or he lovely widow
of murder
without proof
because
they ancestry be the same as
hitlers
you would
spit
in he eye

and every decent american
would
applaud you

now Kabuo miyamoto do one thing
wrong
he be afraid to trust we
at first
afraid that he would be
crucified by prejudice
as mr
hook
be urging you to do

well we send he
and he wife
and thousands of american to
concentration camp
they lost
home belongings everything
we
do that folk
can we now be
unforgiving about he uncertainty
he mistrust

you may think this be a small trial
in a small place
well it be not

every once in awhile
somewhere
in the world
humanity go on
trial
and integrity
and decency
every once in awhile common folk
get called on to give the report
card for the human race

now here in america
we relish
those chance
give we that one
we say
that be why we build this
country in the first place

be american
make you
child proud

i be awful sorry madam but you
know i c

what be you afraid of sheriff

be i going to slip he a weapon
for a mad escape
perhaps a kendo
staff hidden in i dress

there be rule

well please break they then
i will not keep you a moment

i love you
and tomorrow when
i make we bed
i be setting out

you well be there

only if you ask i nice

do you write that column

when i tell
they you do

touch something at a cri

one lantern
like the inventory
say
sorry to disappoint you

actually
i be hope you get
it right
what be that up there

nothing
bit of string

piece of twine be not nothing

here now what be you fixin
to do

have a look
at nothing

you can not go up there touch thing

trial over sheriff it be with
the jury now

you going to climb that with one arm

you be right
i well use two

there be lots of they art look

dozen or more all figure eights
all cut clean through on an angle

and look at that streak of rust
across the mast

it be on the twine too
but it be
not r

do not prove there be two lantern
coulda be the one in the cabin

there be a stretch of ground
between guessin and provine
sheriff
i will give you that



what do you think you be lookin
at now



not what i be looking at
it be
what i be looking for

well
i guess it come down to
a feel do not it
if i
feel
uncertain i feel a
doubt
be not
that it

alex nobody be not ever
sure
about
nothing
it be
un
reasonable to be so
stubborn that you think you be smart
than
eleven
folk who all
agree

the man sit there and
admitted
he
lie
mr
van ness
now
why
be not
that enough for you

we be not tryin he for lying
lots
of we told lie one time or another
Probly none of we murdered anybody

but what
drive
a man to lie
mean he be
hide
something

not
necessarily
that he killed
carl
i be not sayin you be wrong
just that i have i doubt

look if you changed chair right
now cos you doubt that maybe a
chunk of the moon be going to fall
through the roof that would not be
a
reasonable
doubt

okay you win that one
now can
we all go to bed
mcqueen
the moor line
do not that
tell you something

i think it do
miyamoto be on
Carls boat or viceversa
not
much doubt about th
mcqueen
and Carls blood on the gaff

there be a chance it come from his
hand

there be a chance of everything
but you add a chance from here and
a chance from there the world be not
make a coincidence only

look if he give carl a battery
like he said he would only a have
one
left
not two

he explain that
he replace it
mcqueen
only he threw that part in when he
get cornered
but first time around
he never mention it

alex stop arguin just to argue
you can see what
really
happen
same as we
be not that what we be
suppose to do be tell the actual
truth
i god carl die here

so i do not care carl die unless
i be ready to reach for the hangman
rope
you oughta stop tryin to
bully i into hurry

be six hour
you sayin there be
a way to go slow

well
it be imaginative

i will give you that

it be the way it happen i know
it be

no you do not

that report
about the freighter
you do not find that tonight do you

you go right to the cell
then
to the boat
then here
how long
do you know about the freighter

one day

this taste horrible hmmn

you be wonder why i held it

i be wonder how the judge be
going to like i waking up he old
bone
in the middle of the night

you daddy
be quite a feller

yes he be

he be looking down
and he be not
think about the man you be
yesterday
he be proud of the man
you be tonight
that be what count

to i father
everything count

what if i told you he once said
to i
do not matter the road we
take
just so we get there

then you would be lying

do not make i wrong



all right let we say that twine
have
be there to lash a lantern
that it have come from the shuttle of
twine find in the deceased pocket



now to reopen a trial that have
go to jury
new evidence should
be pretty important



tell we why that lantern would be
so significant

well
it show the prosecutor be
wrong
it be
Carls
boat that be
dead in the water
or he would never
have put up the lantern

now you believe there be
two
lantern when defendant arrive
one in Carls hand
the second
lash to the mast

that be what mr
miyamoto reported
and he would have no reason to lie
he could not know that it would help
he case

well why do it

because the second lantern the one
on the mast
be never find
so
we have to ask

where do it go

maybe it go
where carl go
over the side

objection
speculation

you honor
all
of this be
speculation
including mr
hook
dramaturgy about the defendant
issue a false distress call

Tht be summation you

overrule alvin
let we hear
this hmmn

so how do this fit with what
you told we at the start
the
freighter that plow through
ship channel bank

that be when he fell

fall

miyamoto give he the battery and
left
Carls boat be running he
go back to fish
but at some
point he think of the lantern

still lash to the mast

he figure a perfectly good
lantern could get bang around
up there
so he climb up
to
cut it down

just as the freighter come through
be not that quite a coincidence

coincidence happen
you run a
yellow light
just
as a car come
out of nowhere
Splitsecond tragedy
happen every day
or maybe

maybe

maybe carl pick up something about
the freighter on he radio which be
now work
same report Milholland
hear
and
that
make he get the
lantern fast
before the freighter
wake can bang it around

but you
could
be wrong
he
could
have climb up early

then where be the lantern
and
where be the knife

the knife
what knife

coroner find an empty knife sheath
on Carls belt
but they never
find the knife

he climb up
he hand wind still
bleed
that be the blood i find
on the mast
and
the twine

he
cut
the lantern free the
freighter wake
hit
the boat
roll
hard
he bloody hand
slip
tracing blood along the mast

he fall
the lantern the knife
go
into
the water
same as carl

and inside the cabin a coffee
cup fall off the counter

but there be no one around
to
pick it up

still a coincidence
time
and all

the freighter start through
at

the sea water seep
into Carls watch and stopped it
at


still and all
carl be a strong
swimmer he m

he hit he head
on the way in

you think so

the sheriff and the deputy and i
inspect the deck closely
we
find a small fracture in the wood
of the gunnel
just below the mast

well anything coulda cause that

anything
that have a blond hair

request introduction of exhibit
one single blond hair
which sheriff
moran dig out of that fracture
below
the mast
of carl Heines boat

we will call sheriff moran who
will confirm this
and coroner
whaley to testify that the damage
to the gunnel be of a size and
nature not inconsistent with the
deceased skull fracture

but for now
you witness

i have to start reading you
paper more closely
you be quite
a storyteller

thank you
coming from the man who
write but here adrift in the fog
i
plead
for you help
that be quite
a compliment

everything
have to happen
just
right
for you little story to
fly
i mean a blond hair could be
on that gunnel for a
lot
of reason

i be sorry be there a question
in there

well the freighter
the twine
the blood
the knife
the cup
the watch
the second battery
the phantom lantern
the fish
gaff
the crack gunnel
the
skull wound
the blond hair
that be
eleven
thing

twelve

i stand correct sir
and you
have a neat explanation for every
one of they

and since you confess this be
all pure guesswork
what be you
expertise sir be you a detective
of sort

i expertise
be that i be a
journalist

and journalism
be balance
finding
the fact folk need to know

then putting they together
so
truth be revealed

but be not the
truth
that there be
several
other way to explain
each
of these twelve piece

oh yes

but
no
other way
to explain
they all

and since they
all
happen
this be the only explanation
that be the truth

you line of work
you must meet
a lot of man play fast and loose
with the truth

like you could not believe

well the defendant be a liar
he be confess that much
and he
explanation be
he be afraid

afraid that the good folk of
this jury
would be too stupid
to understand
too prejudice
to be fair

you buy that

i think he be greedy

greedy

he do not want to lose any more

he would lost a lot in the war you
see
i have send he away
to a
concentration camp
but a nice
one
far
less brutal than the nazi
because i be a civilized person

i ask you a question you be writing
a tract h

that be how journalist
answer
question

may i answer the question you
honor
Anout the defendant
motivation to lie

i would not miss it for the world
son
now you say
you
send the
defendant to Manzanar

i do not say
i do it alone

so there he be
he father lost
he health there finally die
they lost more than etta Heines
seven acre
they lost they
liberty they dignity
they
ideal about this country

they lost they trust in we
we
have treated they bad than animal
how would we now see tham
as human
being

this man lost a lot in the war
he do not want now to lose his
baby
or the woman who love he

and i expertise in this sir
be
that i lost a lot in the war myself

and the fact that i be the only
witness
who place his
right
hand
upon the holy bible
be the
least
of it sir
i assure you of that

well sir
i hate to spoil the
soliloquy i truly do
but the
fact be
you be not on trial here
nor be judge fielding or myself
nor the good people of this jury
for event that take place twelve
year ago

and i would not blame these good
people if they be a mite resent
ful
at a tactic that insult
they intelligence

that be curious
i be
appeal
to they intelligence

be
you sir
can you
prove
one
word of all you fancy story

no sir i can not
not beyond a
reasonable doubt

it be fortunate that the man who
need
to prove
he
fancy story
beyond a reasonable doubt
be
someone else

i be sorry mr
hook
i apologize
for i tone
this be not a contest
between you and i

for it be not
as mr
gudmundsson
so wisely put it
small trial
in a small place

i lost more in that war than
anyone will ever know
so do
a lot of folk
and what we get
back in return

be a country
where a man
be innocent
until we
prove
he guilty

whether we all get cheated
we be about to find out



all thing considered

you be adequate

i could make a few quibble but
i be loathe to hurt you feeling

cigarette

i will take two
one for later

beautiful

i have always think so

if i whistle
those boy see
you and come runnin

the story today

you ever be strangled by a
single hand

naw i have see what that can do
to a pack of cigarette

well take three

maybe they will keep we waiting

maybe they will not

prejudice be like any obsession

there be a reason why we can not
let go
even when we want to

reason

we do not want to

hate or love
it work the same

you client wife ever mention
we go way ba

she mother
may have say
something

we do not let go you s

it be a rare thing
take a
turning point

you give this jury three chance
to turn

no
other way to explain it
all
that be one
i caught some of
they fluttering waking up on that

second
you
send he to
Manzanar and you do not do
it
alone
i liked that one
they do not
no surprise

last
you give you arm
to
buy this woman back she husband
be they going to cheat you out of that


calling out


some let go some do not
