i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth i smell it
in the air
much that once be be lost
for none now live who remember it



it begin with the forge of the great
ring



three be given to the elf immortal
wise
fair of all being



seven to the dwarf lords great miner
and craftsman of the mountain hall



and nine

race of man who above all else desire
power




for within these ring be bound the
strength and will to govern each race




but they be all of they deceive



for another ring be make



in the land of mordor in the fire of
mount doom the dark lord sauron forge
in secret a master ring to control all
other



and into this ring he poured his
cruelty he malice and his will to
dominate all life



one ring to rule they all

one by one the free land of middle earth
fell to the power of the ring




but there be some
who resist




last alliance of man and elf march
against the army of mordor



on the slope of mount doom they fight
for the freedom of middle earth

victory be near



but the power of the ring could not be
undone



it be in this moment
when all hope have
faded that isildur son of the king
take up he father sword



sauron the enemy of the free people of
middle earth be defeated

clatter to the ground
he body



the ring passed to isildur
who have this
one chance to destroy evil forever




but the heart of man be easily
corrupted
and the ring of power have a
will of it own




it betrayed isildur to he death



and some thing that should not have be
forgotten
be lost




history become legend
legend become
myth



and for two and a half thousand year the
ring passed out of all knowledge



until when chance come it ensnare a
new bearer



i precious




the ring come to the creature gollum who
take it deep into the tunnel of the
misty mountain

the world
rumor grow of a shadow in the
east
whisper of a nameless fear

dangerous business



it be a dangerous business frodo
going out you door
you step onto the
road and if you do not keep you foot
there be not knowing where you might be
swept off to




smoke rise once more from the mountain
of doom
the shadow take shape in the
darkness of mordor
the hour grow
late
and gandalf the grey ride to
isengard seeking i counsel


for that be why you have come be it not
i old friend

saruman


be you sure of this

beyond any doubt

so the ring of power have be find

all these long year it be in the shire
under i very nose

and yet you do not have the wit to see
it
you love of the halflings leaf have
clearly slow you mind

we still have time
time enough to
counter sauron
if we act quickly

time
what time do you think we have



sauron have regain much of he former
strength
he cannot yet take physical
form
but he spirit have lost none of
it potency
conceal within his
fortress the lord of mordor see all
he gaze pierce cloud shadow earth
and flesh
you know of what i speak
gandalf
a great eye lidless wreathe
in flame

the eye of sauron

he be gathering all evil to he

very soon he will have summon an army
great enough to launch an assault upon
middle earth

you know this
how

i have see it

why
why should we fear to use it

seeingstones

may be watch
gandalf throw the cloth
back over the palantir


the hour be late than you think

they crossed the river Isen in
Midsummers eve disguised as rider in
black

they have reach the shire
saruman
shrug

they will find the ring
and kill the
one who carry it

you do not seriously think a hobbit
could contend with the will of sauron
there be none who can

against the power of mordor there can be
no victory
we must join with he
gandalf
we must join with sauron

there be only one lord of the ring
only
one who can bend it to he will

do not share power

so you have chosen death

frodo
frodo

bilbo


hello frodo i lad

bilbo

there and back again
hobbit tale
by bilbo baggins


this be wonderful

i mean to go back
wander the path of
mirkwood visit Laketown see the lonely
mountain again
but age it seem have
finally catch up with i

i miss the shire
i spent all i
childhood pretend i be off somewhere
else
off with you on one of you
adventure
but i own adventure turned out to be
quite different
i be not like you
bilbo

i dear boy


no what have i forgotten
pull back to
reveal frodo hand in he pocket
watch sam

pack already

no harm in be prepared
frodo stroll
to the edge of the balcony

i think you wanted to see the elf
sam


i do

more than anything

i do
it be just
we do what gandalf
wanted do not we
we get the ring this
far to rivendell
and i think
seeing as how you be on the mend we would be
off soon
off home

you be right sam
frodo look at sam

we do what we set out to do
frodo
open he hand the ring sit in his
palm

the ring will be safe in rivendell
i be
ready to go home


he strength return

that wound will never fully heal
he will
carry it the rest of he life

and yet to have come so far still bearing
the ring
the hobbit have show
extraordinary resilience to it evil

it be a burden he should never have to
have to bear
we can ask no more of frodo

gandalf the enemy be moving
Saurons
force be massing in the east
he eye
be fixed on rivendell
and saruman you
tell i have betrayed we
we list of
ally grow thin


he treachery run deep than you know
by foul craft saruman have cross orc
with goblin man
he be breeding an army
in the cavern of isengard
an army that
can move in sunlight and cover great
distance at speed
saruman be coming for
the ring

this evil cannot be concealed by the
power of the elf
we do not have the
strength to fight both mordor and
isengard
gandalf
the ring cannot stay
here



this peril belong to all middle earth
they must decide how to end it
not just
for themselves but for those who come
after
elrond approach gandalf

the time of the elf be over
i people
be leaving these shore
who will you
look to when we have go
the dwarve
they hide in they mountain seeking
riches
they care nothing for the
trouble of other

it be in man that we must place we hope

man
man be weak
the race of man be
failing
the blood of numenor be all but
spent it pride and dignity forgotten
it be because of man the ring survive



i be there gandalf
i be there three
thousand year ago when isildur take the
ring


i be there the day the strength of man
failed


isildur
hurry
follow i

lead isildur into the steaming
volcano



i let isildur into the heart of mount
doom where the ring be forged
the one
place it could be destroyed

cast it into the fire
destroy it

no

isildur

it should have end that day but evil
be allow to endure
isildur keep the
ring
and the line of king be broken
there be no strength left in the world of
man
they be scattered divided
leaderless


there be one who could unite they one
who could re claim the throw of gondor

he turned from that path a long time ago
he have chosen exile


the shard of Narsil
the blade that cut
the ring from Saurons hand
boromir
pick up the sword and gently touch the
blade
close on
a small bloom of blood
appear on Boromirs finger

still sharp

but no more than a break heirloom

replace the break blade but it
clatter to the floor
boromir walk
away leaving strider sitting alone

why do you fear the past
you be
Isildurs heir
not isildur himself
you
be not bound to he fate

the same blood flow in i vein
the
same weakness


you time will come
you will face the
same evil
and you will defeat it

boromir
give the ring to frodo
move to he sword hilt


as you wish
i care not


so gandalf
you try to lead they over
Caradhras
and if that fail
where
then will you go

struggle through the snow



if the mountain defeat you will you
risk a more dangerous road


there be a fell voice in the air

it be saruman


he be trying to bring down the mountain

no

Losto Caradhras sedho hodo nuitho i

we cannot pass over the mountain
let we
go under it
let we go through the mine

you fear to go into those mine
do not you
the dwarve delve too
greedily and too deep



you know what they awake in the darkness
of Khazaddum
shadow and flame

let the ringbearer decide

frodo

we will go through the mine
gandalf
slowly nod

so be it


the wall of moria

Itidin

moonlight


it read the door of Durin lord of
moria

if you be a friend
speak the password and the door will

crude arrow out of a skeleton

goblins

we make for the gap of rohan
we should
never have come here

into the mine

legolas


we now have but one choice
we must face
the long dark of moria
be on you
guard
there be old and foul thing
than the orc in the deep place of the
world


quietly now
it be a four day journey to
the other side
let we hope that we
presence will go unnoticed


i have no memory of this place

be we lost


no
i do not think we be
shhhh
Gandalfs think

merry

what

i be hungry

there be something down there

it be gollum

gollum

he be be following we for three day

he escaped the dungeon of Barad dur

escape
or be set loose
and now the
ring have draw he here
he will never
be rid of he need for it
he hate and
love the ring as he hate and love
himself
Smeagols life be a sad story
gandalf catch Frodos look of surprise

yes
Smeagol he be once called
before
the ring come to he before it drive he
mad


it be a pity bilbo do not kill he when he
have the chance

pity
it be pity that stay Bilbos
hand
many that live deserve death and
some that die deserve life
can you give
it to they frodo
frodo frown

do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment
even the very wise cannot see
all end
i heart tell i that gollum
have some part to play yet for good or
i will before this be over
the pity of
bilbo may rule the fate of many

i wish the ring have never come to i
i
wish none of this have happen

so do all who live to see such time but
that be not for they to decide
all we
have to decide be what to do with the
time that be given to we
there be a note
of finality in Gandalfs voice

there be other force at work in this
world frodo besides the will of evil
bilbo be mean to find the ring
in
which case you also be mean to have
it
and that be an encourage thought
ah
that it be that way
gandalf point
at the right hand tunnel
the fellowship
scramble to they foot

he be remember

no but the air do not smell so foul
down there
if in doubt Meriadoc
always follow you nose
you s


let i risk a little more light
gandalf
tap he staff
for a brief moment a
light

behold
the great realm and dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf
frodo gasp at the brief
sight of a vast roof far above

well there be an eye opener and no
mistake

gimli

oh no


here lie balin son of Fudin lord of
moria

feared
