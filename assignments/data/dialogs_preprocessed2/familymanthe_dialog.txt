fifty dollar jack

just a glass of red wine
for each of we

but i be gettin close right

you want to dance

i do not think there be
dancing here jack

sure there be

whispering to
jack
pretty good for a tire
salesman from jersey

i have i moment



mmmm

these

god i missed that
taste

why be you laughing

i need to tell you
something

okay

i think it may help we
but there be a slight
chance it could make
thing bad

now i be worry
just
say it
whatever it be
well deal with it

be you sure

i feel like i be living
someone else life

i used to be so sure
about everything you
know
i know exactly who
i be and what i wanted
then one morning i wake
up and suddenly it be
all different

badly you mean

no
well maybe a few
thing
but mostly just
different

i never used to be like
this kate
i have it all
figure out
no doubt
no regret

and now

now
i do not

i neither

i think it good to be a
little unsure about who
you be
it very
human

but you always seem so
certain

Cmon jack you think
there be not morning
when i wake up and wonder
what the hell i be do
in new jersey

that be a big one for i
too

i office be a dump i
answer i own phone
and
you have see i pay check

you pay check be a
disgrace to pay check

i mean yes i help people
that need it

i guess
some of they
be probably fake

a laugh then

god sometimes i think it
would be so nice not to
have to stretch ground
beef or maybe drive a car
with a player

imagine have a life
where everything be
easy
where you ask
for thing and people
just bring they to
you

it wonderful

i think about it too
jack

ten
day two week top
they would have approach
you with an offer and

billion not twenty
nine
problem be peter you
have a pussycat run
the show
what you needed
be a rottweiler

well i be impress

so about i car

sure

that tire
it will be

but she say she want an
even number
i say four

but
she say she want six

i tell she margarita i
just get i green card
i like to sit back and
rest a little bit

hector
do i usually
listen to you personal
problem

sure jack all the time

look i have some business
that i have to take care
of in the city so i be
leaving early
i advice to you
follow
you dream







be really more of a
boutique operation as
you can see

but you be not interest
in boutique dollar
i get it



Hes expect you mr
lassiter



alan this be jack
campbell
the one i be
telling you about

jack of course

appropriately
deferential
mr
mintz

please call i alan
we
try to cultivate a casual
atmosphere around here

re
play pen
i can see that alan

you have kid jack

hesitate then

uh
actually yes
two
good one

that be great
gesture to
the sofa
why do not you have a seat

so peter mention that
you be an avid
watcher but do not say
whether you have any
actual wall street
experience

i be a sales associate
at

hutton

broker
really
and now
you be in the tire
business

that be right
and auto
supply

uh huh
the retail end i
understand

uh
we actually get about
sixty percent of we
business from automotive
service

mind if i ask what kind of
sales you do last year
ballpark

we do one point seven
million in total revenue

uh huh
one point seven
and what do you project for
this year

any thought at all on
that

jack

well alan i think be
going to have a banner year
sales be up almost
twenty percent in the
first quarter and we just
landed a major trucking
company account

really
so you be
projecting what a tad
over two million

that be right
and that
would make we number one
in we market
you mind if i stand

look i know we paltry
little two million in
sales be about what you
spend on office supply
in a year
and i know
some regional trucking
company account be
nothing compare to a
sixty billion dollar
merger

i be not trying to knock
the tire business jack

it okay alan
i get it
i be in you shoe i be
think exactly the same
thing
but here the
thing
business be
business
wall street
main street it all
just a bunch of people
get up in the morning
trying to figure out how
the hell they be going to
send they kid to
college
it just
people

and i know people

i be sure you do

let we let the man have
his say

take you for instance

what about i

you drink about sixteen
diet coke a day
you be
an excellent father but
you feel guilty about the
time you spend away from
home
you drink bourbon
but you offer you
client scotch

and you wife decorated
this office

he certainly have you
number alan

you be a little tough
peter

for one thing you like
expensive thing

that be easy
you have see
i car

okay
you smoke Hoyo de
Monterreys
you be a
scotch man single malt
not because it trendy
but because you have be
do it for forty year
and you stay with what
works
you have two great
love in you life you
horse and this company
you weep openly the day
the dow hit ten thousand

and you be a man who
pride himself on finding
talent in unusual
place

oh
and how would you
know that

because i be here

i be prepare to do
anything it take to get
this job
start anywhere
you need i to start
i will park car if i
to
into lassiter
eye
the big part of
judging character be
knowing yourself
and i
know this i can do this
job
give i a chance
peter i will not let you
down

alan why do not you show
jack around a bit

id love to



that be we war room
we do seven major deal
last year three of they
hostile

not particularly
impress
seven
really

let we cut the shit huh
campbell
what do you go
through he wallet or
something

no matter
that circus
act back there may have
dazzle lassiter
momentarily but it
do not do shit forme
even if you get this job
which i highly doubt let
i warn you lassiter
lose interest in he pet
project very quickly
i be in the big office
because i have prove
myself to he year after
year and nobody be going
to come in here and start
turning the old man
head
especially not some
tire salesman from new
jersey
so you watch
yourself and stay away
from lassiter and maybe
just maybe i will keep you
on after he get tire of
you
do we understand
each other

do we

god you really be
different be not you
i mean
wow
i be
impress

good for you
why should not
you protect what be yours

i do not think you be hearing
i

oh i be hearing you alan
that be not the problem
the problem be that what
you think be yours be
really mine
and i do not
care how low on the totem
pole i start i will get
it back
poke he in
the chest
so do yourself a favor and
do not get too attached to
that view because sometime
soon maybe very soon you
and you french country
antique you chintz sofa
and you little play pen
be going to be moving out of
that office

oh and by the way you
try selling tire for a
live
i promise you
you would starve



welcome to xanadu

pretty incredible be not
it

it like a museum

so what be the big
surprise
you do not
rent this place for
the weekend do you

think big

for the week

this place be a perk
kate

perk for what

company called

lassiter and associate
investment house use it
to attract new
executive

you be talking to they
new vice president of
merger and acquisition

what be you talking
about jack

i be going into arbitrage
honey
turn out i have
a knack for it
i will be
making two hundred grand
a year plus a hefty bonus
and that be just to
start
and we can live
in this apartment
practically rent free for
as long as we want

we can finally afford to
move back into the city
in style

be you out of you mind

i do not think so
this
be going to be a good
life for all of we

possibly be think
what about i job

this be new york city
it like the needy
people capital of the
world
those jersey
client of yours be not a
tenth as pathetic as the
one you could get
here

i can not believe you want
to move back into the
city
i think the
reason we left be
because we do not want to
raise the kid here

no this be the center of
the universe
if i be
living in roman time i
would live in rome where
else
today america be
the roman empire and new
york be rome itself
john lennon

jack

kind of funky tension
here

live in this apartment
i do not need this
i will
commute
i will drive to
work

in traffic
it over an
hour each way
