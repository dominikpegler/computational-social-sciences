eight percent lean be about the
best we can hope for

because he be a butcher son and
partly because well he be just
into beef analogy

say
he be also a photographer

i be warning you

official warn
danger will
robinson danger



there be one more person you should
meet
someone integral to i story



that be julie conroy

rest of these loser she do not
grow up in xenia ohio
i just meet

make a difference in i life

bastard motto

principal merkin i realize we have
to teach the child that
recreational drug be the devil
work but that do not mean we
do not dance with the prince of
darkness ourselves every now and
again

ah well bravo
that be just what
we will tell the school board



merk punishment be cruel
expulsion without appeal
or
working for i on the school paper
the school paper would be torture
for a gonzo reporter like julie and
we both know it
but what choice
do she have

so william randolph
you last big
scoop contrasted the popularity of
rice crispie treat and chocolate
Snickerdoodles at the annual bake
sale

that be just one example
i
report have make a difference

let i guess
retail sales of
little chocolate sprinkle have
go through the roof

the school dumpster used to
overflow to the point where the
stench be unbearable
i award
win expose changed all that
the city added an extra weekday
trash pickup

be it true
be ignorance bliss

and i hate
it that you get bust

that whole fact of life talk and
then find out i know more than
you

you be way ahead of i again

proving it

it be the year of the rhizopus
rot
grandpa almost lost the farm
you sacrifice you dream to go to
the prize hog festival
and in the
end you saved the peach and you
do not have to slaughter you sow

how bad could spring
break in los angeles be

i guess we could go to disneyland
or something

think of it as a rite of passage to
manhood

like one of those national
geographic special with the
topless chick

whatever help you cope

i guess it be good than have
tribal pattern carved in i face

there you go

lot of pressure

huh

pressure

you be a multimedia magnate
the
tycoon of tit
the baron of
bottom

you be the emperor of every little
girl who dream of growing up to
see she naughty bit spread eagle
airbrushed to glossy perfection
with staple through she ass

you be the sultan of semen
the
monarch of masturbation
the
merchant prince of lust

i think it be
despicable that we exclude so many
woman that only fit we western
notion of classic beauty


you think we should be more open
minded

the world be a big beautiful
place
we can open new market in
africa and asia
imagine the dali
Lhama reading we magazine

in other word we scope be too
narrow

few leggy ds with blond hair
upstairs and down

that be perfect

want some company


posing
cool
who be you daddy

if that be true this would be
one seriously constipate town
most guy in xenia have be
looking at naked girl in heaven
since they be old enough to
figure out they dad hide it under
the mattress

be not it true principal merkin

principal merkin be right
we can not
let heaven violate we own
daughter wife sister mother
girlfriend aunt

i would not want to name name mr
needleman or because any undue
embarrassment
but many member of
this community have be loyal
heaven reader for the good
part of the last two decade
not
to mention certain charter
subscriber who have developed a
voracious appetite for we video
library as well

i always think i wanted fame and
fortune and beautiful woman
but
sometimes you dream come true
and they because you nothing but
grief

you parent never wanted to
interfere with you life ted
they
know you mom and dad loved you
very much
they know they do the
right thing
but that do not mean

from afar

you mean they know who i be

i wonder about they for so many

i wonder
why they give i up

give you up be the most
unselfish thing they ever do
when
they found heaven they wished
they could take you back but it be
too late
all they could do be build the
empire knowing that someday it
would all be yours

i legacy

you parent would be crushed to
think you be not happy with it

they be not i parent helen
i
parent be back in xenia and i
hurt they very much

i understand

and the girl i love she hate
heaven

never respect i

i will not have i boy argue

so when i be seventeen can i turn
everyone life upsidedown behave
like a total piece of canine
excrement and then wipe the slate
clean with a halfbaked apology and
a kodak moment

no

which be precisely why i get the
right to i new room

i need you help
i be really in
deep shit

do not say shit honey
use the
strong vocabulary god give you

besides there be no problem too
deep or too shitty for we to solve

son it be a simple fix
the only
difference between i store and
that magazine of yours be a bunch
of zero
now have i ever told you
the story about the can of peach

lady gentleman
heaven have
go to hell

i loved i brother
i stand by his
wish to let he son run the
company
son he never know
son
that he and he wife give away at
birth
son who be raised in a
world quite different from we own
nevertheless i be there for the
lad
i guided he as best i could
but he be only seventeen with a
mind of he own and judgment that
be well frankly not a chip off
the old block
there be only one
clear solution
and i think we all know what that
be






what be you do

i job
back off benedict

the only man i called dad own a
little grocery store in xenia
ohio
he learned a lot of cool
stuff from i grandpa who be a
peach farmer in he day
grandpa
know the right thing to say in
every situation and it usually
involve peach
i dado a lot
like he
and he taught i you
have to focus on the peachy side of
life not the pit

there be a time when can
peach be the hot great
thing ever invent
it be like a little taste of
summer anytime you wanted
grocery
store could not keep they in stock
they be so popular
and even
though other can fruit like
pear plum and pineapple have
come along people still need to
know they can get they can
peach on the same shelf
whenever they want they
it be
comfort you know
it fulfill
they expectation

you be probably wonder if
there be a point to all this and i
guess it be just that i goof last
month
i not only moved the can
peach i restock the shelf
with kiwi guava and mandarin
orange in heavy syrup
i
challenged people expectation
and you can not do that to you
customer
so i ask you for one
more chance to fix thing and give
we reader back they can
peach

thanks for teaching i an important
lesson
what make a family be
love not blood

all be fair in heaven Tedbaby

that be right
and guess who be the
new king of the unemployment line

aw come on kid
throw i a bone
i be you uncle for gosh sake



it be easy to fall prey to petty
jealousy when consider the young
life of ted nelson
but how would
any of we behave if one day all we
dream come true
would we handle
it half as well
would we find
ourselves making the same mistake
for which we criticize he


one can only hope that ted nelson
will find big and good dream
upon which to set he sight as the
year pass
and that he will
remember always where he come
from


three

not bad for a hack
he have a future
in yellow journalism

he kick major ass and you know
it

this one for you dick merkin of
Tecumseh high
