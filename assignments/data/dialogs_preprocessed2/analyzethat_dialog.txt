because he twisted a guy head off
once

off

off
fuckin calabrese animal
and comino from i you know that be a
big compliment

i be sure they would be flattered
so

the feds be really putting the
pressure on
the family be

it be the fall of the
fuckin roman empire
it be
world war three out there

so what do that have to do with you

they know i be gettin out soon and
the last thing anybody want to see be
i get into it on either side

maybe if you just explain to
they that you be out of it now
that you be starting a new life

i a party and give i a gold watch
trust i nobody lookin forward
to i be out

think about it
lock up he be
absolutely no use to i
but back on
the street Vittis still powerful
enough to pose a threat to both

on a fire

if we can use vitti to escalate this
war we might just end up putting they

people like paul vitti do not
change
this guy be a menace to
society since he be twelve year old
be a criminal be all he know
trust i

he be going to head straight for trouble

twenty maybe even thirty indictment
next time the grand jury convene

you know giuliani start this way
