yeah i want the truth

i do not think so

well do you mean all of we or just
john

with all of you

that be a real nice attitude claire

oh be honest andy
if brian come
walking up to you in the hall on
monday what would you do
i mean
picture this you be there with all
the sport
i know exactly what
you would do you would say hi to he and
when he left you would cut he all up
so you friend would not think you
really liked he

no way

kay what if i come up to you

same exact thing

you be a bitch

why
because i be telling the truth
that make i a bitch

no
because you know how shitty that
be to do to someone
and you do not
get the ball to stand up to you
friend and tell they that you be
going to like who you want to like

okay what about you you hypocrite
why do not you take allison to one of
you heavy metal vomit party
or
take brian out to the park lot at
lunch to get high
what about andy
for that matter what about i
what would you friend say if we
be walking down the hall together
they would laugh they ass off and
you would probably tell they you be
do it with i so they would forgive
you for be see with i

do not you ever talk about i
friend
you do not know any of i
friend you do not look at any of i
friend and you certainly would not
condescend to speak to any of i
friend so you just stick to the
thing you know shop nail
polish you father and you
poorrichdrunk mother in the
carribean

shut up

and as far as be concern about
what be going to happen when you and i
walk down the hallway at school
you can forget it
because it be never
going to happen
just bury you head
in the sand
and wait for you
fuckin prom

i hate you

yeah
good

then i assume allison and i be
good people than you guy huh
we weirdo
do you would you do that to i

i do not have any friend

well if you do

no
i do not think the kind of
friend i would have would mind

i just want to tell each of you
that i would not do that
i would not
and i will not
because i think that be
real shitty

you friend would not mind because
they look up to we

so conceited
you be so like full
of yourself why be you like that

i be not saying that to be conceited
i hate it
i hate have to go
along with everything i friend say

well then why do you do it

i do not know i do not
you do not
understand

you be not
friend with the same kind of people
that andy and i be friend with

you think
i do not understand pressure claire
well fuck you
