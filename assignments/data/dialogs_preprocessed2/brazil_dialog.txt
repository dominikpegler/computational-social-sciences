be behind this recent increase in
terrorist bombing

bad sportsmanship
ruthless
minority of people seem to have
forgotten certain good old fashion
virtue
they just can not stand seeing
the other fellow win
if these people
would just play the game instead of
standing on the touch line heckling

in fact killing people

in fact killing people they would
get a lot more out of life

mr
what would you say to
those critic who maintain that the
ministry of information have become
too large and unwieldy

david
in a free society
information be the name of the game
you can not win the game if you be a
man short

and the cost of it all deputy
minister
seven percent of the gross
national produce

i understand this concern on behalf
of the taxpayer
people want value
for money and a costeffective
service



that be why we always insist on the
principle of information retrieval
charge
these terrorist be not
pulling they weight and it be
absolutely right and fair that those
find guilty should pay for they
period of detention and the
information retrieval procedure used
in they interrogation
scene delete
delete



do you think that the government be
winning the battle against
terrorist

on yes
we morale be much high
than theirs we be field all they
stroke running a lot of they out
and pretty consistently knocking they
for six
i would say they be nearly out
of the game

but the bomb campaign be now in
it thirteenth year

beginner luck

not much

enough though eh

somewhere in the build some
insect confused two of we client
and

that be
buttle be not it

christ

no no i do not
i be just beginning
honestly
sorry carry on

well you
buttle have be
confused with an
tuttle
i mean it be a joke
somebody should
be shoot for that
so be
pulled in by mistake

you get the wrong man

i do not get the wrong man
i get
the right man
the wrong man be
deliver to i as the right man
i
accepted he on trust as the right
man
be i wrong
anyway to add to
the confusion he die on we
which
have he be the right man he
would not have do

you killed he

sam there be very rigid parameter
laid down to avoid that event but
Buttles heart condition do not
appear on Tuttles file
do not think
i be dismiss this business sam
i have lost a week sleep over it
already

i be sure you have

there be some real bastard in this
department who do not mind breaking a
few egg to make an omelette but
thank god there be the new boy like
i who want to maintain decent
civilized standard of terrorist
eradication
we have get the upper hand
for the moment but they be waiting
for we to slip up and a little slip
up like this be just the chance
they be looking for

so how

what i have get to do now be pick up
tuttle interrogate he at the same
voltage as buttle to the same meter
reading to the last penny and juggle
the book in electrical bank

what have tuttle do

we suspect he of freelance
subversion

he be a freelance subversive

he be a compulsive heat engineer

maverick exCentral service repair
man with a grudge against society
now fortunately we be nearly out of
the wood i think
at least we will
be when i get this layton woman under
arrest

what be she do

you do not know as much about this
business as you pretended to do
you

er

very smart

er
but i would have find out
anyway

yes
i be impress

tell i about layton

she witness the tuttle arrest the
buttle arrest and since then she be
be making wild allegation
obviously trying to exploit the
situation she be working for
somebody and she be not working for
we

terrorist

ah
thank

but surely i mean perhaps she just
happen to live above the Buttles
and

picking up photograph of
wife and kid from he
desk
look after that suit eh
barbara
choose it for i

right
er you be not going to keep
calling she barbara be you

Barbaras a perfectly good name

drop
look about the layton woman maybe
she be just trying to help the buttle
family

why

why
hell not for any reason

baffle
i do not follow you

out of kindness

you do trust i do not you

of course
we go to school
together
you be i old friend

and you be mine

just between the two of we

right
just between as and the
security force

they be not at school with we

but i have already put she on the
search and detain list

take she off the list

there be no procedure for that until

we would advise you that a plea of
guilty will save you and the tax
payer money and will always be
look upon more favourably than a
plea of not guilty
all you be
requested to do at this stage be to
sign this form

not interest

what have you do with jill

right

what be happen to
jill

you have get quite a list
of misdemeanour here have not you
all this be going to take time and
money and i be afraid accord to
you bank statement and credit rate
here you be likely to be in deep
financial trouble by the end of it
now either you plead guilty to say
seven or eight of these charge
which bring the cost down to
within you reach or you can borrow
a sum to be negotiated from we at
very competitive rate
we can offer
you something at say eleven and a
half per cent over thirty year
but
you will have to buy insurance to
qualify for he scheme

all you have to do be to agree to
sign the appropriate box on these
form
yes or no

i be not guilty
not guilty you stupid
bastar

now since you have elected to plead
not guilty on all these charge
you would be well advise to take some
sort of insurance cover
preferably
comprehensive or if you would prefer
something more specific say
against electrical charge over
f

and for food and
accommodation cost of say

detention can be a very expensive
business

now before we bear you with the
small print perhaps you would like to
tell we whether you would like to sign
this insurance acceptance form or
not
think carefully before you
decide
thinking ahead in financial
matter be always the wise course

we be here to save you and the tax
payer money

would you like to pay the premium for
a single room with a shower and a
soft bed

for a small charge we can keep visit
from friend and relative down to to
a minimum

plead guilty it be easier quick
and cheap for everyone

we be do a survey
aim at
provide a good service

do you think the present system be
efficient
inefficient

as a taxpayer be you
impress
