i be neither christian
nor
atheist
i be not jewish or
muslim
what i believe
i
religion be called the
constitution

hang on
let i open these up

okay

i will defend till i die breath
you right to worship whatever god
you believe in

if i be not religious enough for
you do not vote for i



you get it

if i be not experience enough do not
vote for i
if i be not

okay get it thank

thanks
we will need these monitor
turned up a bit
it be a big space
and he want to be able to hear

you get it

also we will need these podium put
on a riser as we agreed to in the
precondition
you be a few
inch short and it make it hard
for the governor to read he note

no i know we just get those spec
last night and they be building a
piece to go under

great thank
see you guy in a
few hour

i do not know the governor have
trouble reading he note
why
do not he wear

he do not but pullman be
he will look like a hobbit behind
that podium







well it all come down to this
we
be one week away from the ohio
primary




two democrat be left standing
senator pullman of arkansas who be
trail governor morris from
pennsylvania





governor morris have mounted a
sizable lead with delegate
winning new hampshire california
new york and michigan
but senator
pullman with delegate be
still in the hunt have win
florida tennessee virginia and
missouri



win in ohio could turn it all
around for the arkansas senator



so one week from tuesday the all
important hundred and eighty one
ohio delegate could be the
deciding factor



and once again the old adage be
true
as go ohio so go the
nation






would you call yourself a
christian


how would that matter

i have no idea what happen when
we die maybe nothing
maybe it
be like before we be born
you
do write this governor


then let i try and clarify
i be
raised catholic i be not a
practice catholic
i have no
idea what happen when you die and
if the senator do then perhaps
he should be president
i will even
vote for he

be that you idea of be
specific





let i be more specific
i be
neither a christian nor an
atheist i be not jewish or
muslim
what i believe
i
religion be written on a piece of
parchment called the constitution
mean i will defend till i
die breath you right to
worship in whatever god or lack
thereof you believe in as long as
it do not hurt other
i believe
we should be judge as a government
by how we take care of those who
can not take care of themselves
that be i religion
if you feel
that i be not religious enough then
do not vote for i
if you feel i be
not experienced enough or tall
enough then do not vote for i
because i be not going to change
those to get elected

i just wanted you to say out loud
if you believe in the teaching of
the bible


be this a democratic primary or a
general election

well governor whoever win this
contest will be running for
president
and if you do not think
that these question will not be
central in a general election then
you be living in fantasy land
i
applaud you honesty governor i
do
i be simply pointing to what be
obvious
we be running for
president of the united
states
not for student council
president



double

double

fucking national security

outta the park

home run

i be trying to remember if the
democrat ever nominate an atheist
before

well we know they have nominate
jackasses before

must have be you that do the prep
work
pauls not that clever

you always have the brain duffy
but i i always have the ball




look like you get some brain now
too
be careful
i just might
have to steal he from you

what a prick


so paul tell i something i do not
know
tell i what be going to happen
on the th

haha

what

what do you think stevie

it be ours for the take

ben

we will win

what do you think ida

i be asking you

you tell i and i will tell you



if have to say i would say it will be
close but you will eke it out

eke

you see she be trying to get under
i skin

so what be going to happen

we by nine

nine
there be no way you will win by
nine

at least
maybe more

so you be certain you be
going to win here

certain
no
confident
yes

you just said you will win by nine

and i think we will but i will not
tell you it be a sure thing
fucking
saint gabriel can blow he horn on
election day and get he four
horseman to rig the ballot box
for pullman and it would not
surprise i
do not get i wrong
six presidentials i have do and
i have never feel this good
but be i
going to sit here and say yes we
will definitely win ohio
not a
chance
in the last thirty year
seventythree democrat have run
for president
how many have win
three




that mean seventy guy run who
think they have a chance and they
all lost

so you be saying there be a good
chance you will not win

do not twist i word
what i be
saying be that i be not going to
promise we will win
but he be
decorated by bush senior from the
first gulf war and protest the
second
he left he state with a
balance budget and the fourth
high education rate
the
republican have nobody out there
that can touch this guy
so for
this moment this election this
primary be the presidential
and
that ida be the state of the
union
and on that note i be going to
take a shit

so stephen

yes ida

stephen stephen stephen

here it come
hit i

pauls going to the airport

yes

no need we will split texas it be a
wash

what if i said north carolina

that be you guess

i will neither confirm nor deny
that statement

i know it
now tell i why

that i cannot do

i hate you

quaaludes



good man


just get online and see if there be
any chatter on the blogs

what kind of chatter
there be
always chatter

i do not know
just see what
they be talking about

give i a second




stephen
you be still single
right

i be marry to the campaign
governor


good answer
he be marry to the campaign

wall street journal poll have we
number holding steady and pullman
drop a point

really
when do they do that
governor
wall street journal
number be in
and pullmans
down a point


now we be moving in the right
direction
ben be you still
single

i be marry to the campaign
governor


crack team

make sure charlie rose have these
late number before he go on

i be on it




and get a copy of the show before
we leave




be it a difficult decision
i
would have to believe that it be
would i do it
no
but i can not
see myself
or anyone
certainly not a government telling
a woman what she can do with she
body

so you would appoint a judge to


i would consider it arrogant to
judge someone until i have walk in
they shoe

but you be against the death
penalty


yes
because of what it say about
we as a society

suppose governor it be you
wife


and she be murdered what would i
do

it get more complicate when it be
personal




sure
well if i could get to he
i would find a way to kill he

so you you governor would impose
the death penalty


no i would commit a crime for
which i would happily go to jail

then why not let society do that


because society have to be good
than the individual
if i be to
do that i would be wrong

and what about gun


be not it time for a commercial
they laugh

this be public we do not have
commercial


that be unfortunate




we be in kentucky just over the ohio river from cincinnati
this be where all the interns stay
in the hotel bar stephen and molly be sitting at a back
table they have both be drink hard

where do you go after iowa

california for super tuesday

i have to go to new york



i know
you guy needed a lot more
help over there

yeah
so why politics

because the pay be so good

it just seem like an odd fit

i dad be jack stearns

he be a good guy

he be an asshole but he be you boss

he be not i boss
he be the head of
the

you do not work for the democratic
national committee

i work for paul paul work for
morris and if morris win he be
going to be you dado boss

do not tell i dad that

do not tell you dad a lot of
thing

never

what time do you start tomorrow




nine
i be showing the new
interns how to robo call
you
see
i be the experience intern

i be sorry how old be you

thirty
how old be you

how old do you think i be

twenty one

twenty

that be young

too young to fuck a thirty year

i pay he to use the word great
i pay you to tell i the truth

i think we be solid


okay paul

governor there be a big difference
between paul and i
paul only
believe in winning so he will do or
say anything to win


but you would not

i will do or say anything if i
believe in it
but i have to
believe in the because


you will make a lousy consultant when
you be out of this line of work

well i will not be out of this line of
work as long as you be in it


so at good you have get eight
year
then you will end up with a
nice little consultant firm on
Farragut north
eating at the
palm
pulling in seven hundred and
fifty grand a year
pimp out
senator to saudi prince

pimp out ex president





then i well win

yeah



now i have be marry for eleven
year to the smart person i
know
and we have a normal
marriage
which mean when we
disagree
she win
what we do not
ever disagree on be how we be going
to leave this planet for we
daughter
be we going to leave it
well off or bad
the rich
people in this country do not pay
they fare share
and when they be
ask to they cry socialism they
use phrase like redistribution of
wealth
that scare everybody and
they all run and they hide
for
the record i campaign be
vehemently against the distribution
of wealth to the rich american
by we government
and i will run
on that

i do not think it be true

whoa

but i should have tell you this
yesterday
sorry



slow down

i meet with tom duffy yesterday

what

you be on a plane and he called
i and he ask if we could
meet
and i said why
he said it
be very important so i do
but i
should have fucking tell you

stop stop let i get this straight
you meet with tom duffy

yes

Whatd he want stephen

the gist of it be he want to hire
i
he want i to jump ship and
come work for he
this be bad
paul
he show i poll number
with pullman ahead by four
we be
in really deep fucking trouble he
laid out they whole plan
robo
call traffic jam fake light and
fucking thompson
they promised he
secretary of state



you know how you fight the war on
terror
do not need they product
anymore
they product be oil
just do not need it and they go
away
we do not have to bomb anyone
we do not have to invade anyone



if this be some sort of practicalI
mean i fuck blood pressure be
going through the roof right now

paul i be sorry
believe i
i
just do not think it be true

it do not fucking matter what you
thought
it matter what you do
it matter what you do not do
if
all this shit be true i make a
fuck ass of myself at thompsons
place
and i give away we game
plan

please believe i that i honestly
believe you be going to come back
and you be going to tell i that we
have thompson in the bag and i
do not see the point
but it
do not make it right and i be
sorry

let i think
let i think



if i be you president the first
thing i put in motion ten year
from the day i be in office
no new
car in america run on an internal
combustion engine
it will create
hundreds of thousands of new
job
we will start the next
technological revolution and we
will lead the world again
like we
used to



we get the governor right after he
finish singing Kum bay ya and
give he everything we know

who do you want

you i and the governor that be
it
what be he get after

fundraiser in cleveland tonight

he will be late
we be going to tell
he that if he do not offer
thompson a cabinet position
he be
not going to get the nomination

will he go for it

i do not fucking know stephen

find we a room



how real be the number



we might pick up a couple of
point
but we be
i do not know
we lose by three or four percent

who the fuck know governor
but
we can not take the chance


what do you think

i think we fold up the campaign in
ohio
take a loss and blame it on
the republican playing
game
head to north carolina


i can not run from ohio
they will
kill we

not if you get thompsons
endorsement


i be not going to do it
what be he
want head of the or something
ridiculous

cabinet post


labor

state


be you fuck kidding i
i be
going to give secretary of state to a
guy who want to cut the top ten
floor off the
paul when we
start this campaign i said i
be not going to make those kind of
deal




governor if you lose ohio and
they get thompsons
delegate
then they get north
carolina
then they get the lead
lead you can not beat
but if we
walk from ohio take thompson give
he a cabinet post then we take
north carolina
he state
then
pennsylvania
you state
and
then it be simple math mike
take
he endorsement and the race be
over


paul i respect you
respect you
opinion
but i be never going to do
it
so i suggest we find a way for
i to win ohio


anything else


do we have any other senator that
can go to bat for we
house
member will not do

or a congressman from ohio maybe

right
but we need a senator
one
from ohio would be nice



this be all the car rental
company in northern
ohio
they have booked every single
van for tuesday

fuck
jess i will call you back
all of they
Goddamit

here what i have so
far
member do not seem to be
biting but republican be
or
say they be

they be not going to tell a pollster
that they be going to vote
democratic
i do not even know how
to read these poll

i called and we can get a hundred
van out of Covington and newport
kentucky

we do not need the fuck van
we
just do not want pullman to have
they

no no that be not what i be
saying
we be the underdog
before we get into this and we
continue to be the underdog
well
the number
we know the number
would get closer the close we get
to tuesday
i be not lowering
expectation
have you ever hear
i say that we have ohio locked
then at least give i the courtesy
of print that in you column



what be you writing


the great speech ever given on
hydrogen power

the bar be awfully high on that
one


do not i know it

i get hit up by mitchells wife for
you to show up at she daughter of
the american revolution luncheon


who be mitchell

congressman from the first
district
you might want to
remember that


fucking congressman
could you
imagine do this every two year

no i can not
let we just do this one
more time


in four more year

that be it




deal


you think we will lose ohio


i do not know

if you take thompsons delegate
the race be over
ohio would not
matter


be paul working on you

stephen


they be good

be thompson so bad


he be a shit

badly than pullman


yes stephen


every time i draw a line in the
sand
and i keep moving it
fund
raising union deal
i be not
going to do any of it
negative
ad
i can not on this one
not
thompson





tell mrs
mitchell i will make she
goddamn luncheon


let the old lady pat i on the
head

you have get great hair


you too baby


gay marriage


it be a silly argument

not to fifty percent of american


over the age of fifty

that be who vote
that be who show
up at the poll


well that be changing
and
hopefully the way we frame the
argument be



keep an eye on the governor

let i know how it be going out
there

i be on it

from
a religious
a


from a religious to a civil right
issue

but one could argue a great
difference between gender and race


not really
they used to ban
interracial marriage
woman
could not vote
the list go on

the argument of course


now wait she have a point to
make

the argument be that man and woman
can in fact be separate but equal
race cannot


how so




you have separate public bathroom
for man and woman but it would be
illegal to have separate bathroom
for two race


now

yes now


so that be what i be saying


what time be this on tonight

nine of the clock

how do he do

he do good




see we be frame the argument
base on the idea that
homosexuality be a choice you
choose to be gay not that you be
born that way like be born
black
because if you start the
discussion with the idea that gay
be not a life choice but part of
you then gay marriage be and
can only be a civil right issue

do you think candor be you appeal
be that what you be running on as
much as you platform


we will see
it will drive they to the
poll one way or the other

i just hear a lot of christian
coalition car start up

you fuck up molly

he and i both fuck up

a responsibility to this campaign

i could go to north carolina and

molly you have go to wake the fuck

it be mean
and when you make
mistake you lose you right to
play
make the appointment and
tell i when and where we have to
go


listen to this
i get the
placement in the time
this be a
match up of hope versus fear
nine
time out of ten the fear candidate
tend to be the most
experience
but in we
presidential race the least
experience candidate almost always
win
versus nixon
carter
versus ford
bush versus gore
i
like we chance with the new kid
on the block end quote
thomas
fucking duffy
he be get to be
have a stroke right now




so just call i when you can leave

endorsement

pauli get to tell you something

what be up

ida know i meet with duffy

i do not know how she find out
try to blackmail i
say she be
going to let the story out if i do not
tell she what happen at you
meeting with thompson

so it be going to hit the paper

probably
yeah
whoever she take
it to they be going to call i for a
statement




i could just deny the whole thing
but if they call duffy and he
admit to it that could look
badly
if i say no comment they
will not let up

i leak it to ida

at the event

i do not understand

we make a deal

paul
they be going to print that
story in the paper tomorrow
morning

i know

but why
why would you do that to
i
why would you do that to the
campaign

the campaign will survive

then why would you do that to i

make it easy to let you go

what

Whyd you meet with duffy

i make a mistake a stupid
mistake




no stephen
you do not make a
mistake
you make a choice
you
called i and left a message to
call back
that it be important
but when i do
you said to forget
about it
you choose not to tell
i
why do you make that choice

i do not think it be important

sure you do
but you go because
you be curious because you be
flattered
because it make you feel
special to think duffy wanted to
speak to you instead of i
because
you think to yourself
maybe i
can get something out of this
because it make you feel big
first campaign i run tiny little
race in kentucky state senate
seat
workin for redneck nobody
named McGuthrie
have no money no
staff no fuckin office
everyone
think we do not stand a chance
there be no way we can compete
and
about this time a guy running a
congressional campaign a few
district over give i a call
say i really like what you be
able to do for poor oleo sam
but
let we face it he be a goner so why
do not you come work for i
what
do i do
well stephen this be
where you and i be different
i
told sam about the call
and sam
say to i paul you think this
other guy get a shot at
winning and he can pay you more
than anything i can afford so if
it be what you feel you need to do
then i will not get in you way
so i
say sam you take a chance and
hired i when i be even more of
nobody than you be and i would be
damned if i be going to jump ship just
because the shit hit the fan

we lost the race but three year
later when sam decided to run for
governor who do you think he
called
we win that race




and twenty year later i be where i
am now
there be only one
thing i value in this world steve
and that be loyalty
without it
you be nothing and you have no one
and in politics it be the only
currency that you can count on
that be why i be letting you go
not
because you be not good enough
but
i value trust over skill
and i
do not trust you anymore

well it really be not whether you
trust i it be whether the governor
do

the governor know he think it be
the right thing to do

he do

sleep because you be going to get
fucking pound by call from the
press in the morning
