i be visit
by someone i
have hope never to meet
in the distance rising like a dark mountain be a strange
monastery
dim light come from a couple of window
we can hear from far away the indistinct droning voice of
the story teller a young

move up over and way ahead of the
continuing through the snowstorm over field forest
valley rock until it reach the monastery high on a
rugged hill
here it enter one of the dimly light monastery
window taking we into a dine hall

enter via a window and looking down into the monastery
dine hall we see sitting at a long
refectory table
they be eating they supper and listen
to a young
who be sitting on a dais at the far
end of the hall he eye closed in a trance telling a
story

have capture the wind and
tamed the storm
the chief
steward laying down to take his
rest have a disturb dream

dream that a hooded rider be
approaching across the snowswept
plain





rider who would challenge the
very foundation of the world

standing on the threshhold be the hooded figure covered
with snow

young

and as the water rose
the
people need for story grow
story that would feed a great
hunger
hunger for more than just
understand
continue telling the story in the background

what exactly do you do here

universe
the story without which
there be nothing

that if you stop telling a story
waving in the direction
of percy

up a fiction
that the universe
cease to exist


you make it sound so simple

and you believe it

smile

incredible
it be just incredible to
i that you can believe something
that can be so easily disprove


i do not think so
turn and throw a spell at who go rigid like
a statue strike dumb

another sitting at the table immediately continue the
story

have be bring to the limit
of he endurance

be sitting in a corner head in hand
he seem
utterly destroyed

you be a lliar
you have be lying
to we all along
who be you
who
be those thug

i be not a liar

no

no
i just
do not divulge
everything i know

come to the same thing

absolutely not
not in law

you steal they money

no
i do not

that be what they said




be you going to believe they
before you believe i

why not

because they be irredeemably bad
people and i be essentially good
i
know that sound terribly prim and
arrogant and self righteous but
i be trying to be honest
look the
truth be
in order to get i
charity off the ground i needed
capital
look askance

yes i know and you be right but
that be the way the grownup
the
real world works
you can not make
omelette without soil you
hand
or should that be the other
way round
anyway i with
hindsight very foolishly accepted
a loan from people who seem to
i at the time to be very decent
and sincere
there be absolutely
no way i could have known that they
be part of a ruthless organise
crime syndicate and that they
wanted to use i charity to launder
money
i make a mistake
and i have
to live with that
i be sorry
what
more can i say
want to believe
and do not

distress but basically
sympathetic
oh tony

but can we not talk about i for a
moment
i want to thank the doctor
for letting i experience the most
sublime inspire




so why be they trying to kkill
you
again
be what they said

what

answering he own
question
the first time they hung you from
the bbridge
right
Bbecause
you steal they money

stop saying that
i do not steal
it
i do not have it
i would have to
invest in infrastructure
i needed
more time
when you run a charity
you have to give lots of money
away
you would not believe the red
tape
the charity commission be a
bunch of fascist
it be incredible
i mean
mon give i a break
i
almost die today
and i said i be
sorry
