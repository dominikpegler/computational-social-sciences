the Mayflowers peculiar interest
in three da vinci piece
they

authority
i recommend
leniency

oh i think we all do

do you think she have any idea that
operation Deflower mayflower be as
bogus as kit kats tit

i do not think so although bringing
she to the castle give she a big
juicy hint

with all due respect to that great
blouse why do not i cut out she
heart

close call but she be we only way
of keeping tab on that damn
