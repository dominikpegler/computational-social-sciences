the food be marvelous in cuba the

color blend in far off
landscape but do not feel right in
spending you money for this stop
there be no war in cuba regards
wheeler

you see

word

i think we will have to send we
friend wheeler a cable mr

to make it short than he because
he be working on an expense account
and we be not
let i see
mike

a fairly tough
customer prepare
to take dictation
he mouth still
full of food
go ahead mr

provide the war

that be fine mr

right away

right away

i come to see you charles about
you about the enquirer campaign
against the metropolitan transfer
company

will not you step into i office mr
thatcher

i think i should remind you
charles of a fact you seem to
have forgotten
you be yourself
one of the large individual
stockholder

mr
thatcher be not everything
i have be saying in the enquirer
about the traction trust absolutely
true

they be all part of you general
attack you senseless attack
on everything and everybody who be
get more than ten cent in he
pocket
they be

the trouble be mr
thatcher you
do not realize you be talking to
two people

as charles foster kane who have
eightytwo thousand six hundred
and thirtyone share of
metropolitan transfer you see i
do have a rough idea of i holding
i sympathize with you
charles
foster kane be a dangerous
scoundrel he paper should be run
out of town and a committee should
be form to boycott he
you
may if you can form such a
committee put i down for a
contribution of one thousand
dollar

charles i time be too valuable
for i

on the other hand
he manner become
serious
i be the publisher of the enquirer
as such it be i duty i will let
you in on a little secret it be
also i pleasure to see to it
that decent hardworking people
of this city be not robbed blind
by a group of money mad pirate
because god help they they have
no one to look after they
interest
i will let you in on
another little secret mr
thatcher
i think i be the man to do it
you
see i have money and property

if i do not defend the interest of
the underprivileged somebody else
will maybe somebody without any
money or any property and that
would be too bad

do you know how to tap mr
thatcher
you ought to learn
humming quietly
he continue to
dance

i happen to see you consolidate
statement yesterday charles
could i not suggest to you that it
be unwise for you to continue this
philanthropic enterprise
this enquirer that be costing
you one million dollar a year

you be right
we do lose a million
dollar last year

we expect to lost a million next
year too
you know mr
thatcher
start tapping
quietly
at the rate of a million a year
we will have to close this place in
sixty year


you have enjoy a very rare
privilege young man
do you
find what you be looking for

no
tell i something miss
anderson

mr
kane from the very begin

from before the begin young
fellow

we think maybe if we can
find out what he mean by that
last word as he be die

that rosebud
maybe some girl
there be a lot of they back in
the early day and

not some girl he know casually and
then remember after fifty year
on he death bed

you be pretty young mr

mr
thompson
fellow will
remember thing you would not think
he would remember
you take i
one
day back in i be crossing
over to jersey on a ferry and as
we pulled out there be another
ferry pulling in
and on it there be a girl
waiting to get off
white dress
she have on and she be carrying
a white pastrol and i only see
she for one second and she do not
see i at all but i will bet a
month have not go by since that i
have not think of that girl
see what i mean
well so what be you do about
this rosebud mr
thompson

i be calling on people who know mr
kane
i be calling on you

who else you be to see

well i go down to atlantic city

susie
i called she myself the
day after he die
i think maybe
somebody ought to
she could not even come to the
phone

you know why
she be so

sure sure

i be going back there

who else do you see

nobody else but i have be through
that stuff of walter thatchers
that journal of he

thatcher
that man be the big
darn fool i ever meet

he make an awful lot of money

it be not trick to make an awful
lot of money if all you want be to
make a lot of money
he eye get
reflective
thatcher

he never know there be anything
in the world but money
that kind
of fellow you can fool every day
in the week and twice on sunday
the time he come to rome for mr
kanes twentyfifth birthday
you know when mr
kane get control
of he own
money
such a fool like thatcher
i tell you nobody business


he know what he wanted mr
kane
do and he get it
thatcher never
do figure he out
he be hard
to figure sometimes even for i
mr
kane be a genius like he said
he have that funny sense of humor
sometimes even i do not get the
joke
like that night the opera
house of his opened in chicago
you know the opera house he build
for susie she should be an opera
singer
indicate with a
little wave of he
hand what he think
of that
sigh
that be year later of course
it be
mrs
kane take the
lead part in the opera and she
be terrible
but nobody have the
nerve to say so not even the
critic
mr
kane be a big man
in those day
but this one fellow
this friend of he branford leland


turn to a young
hireling
quietly
what about branford leland
have
he get in he copy

not yet

go in and ask he to hurry

well why do not you mr
bernstein
you know mr
leland

look at he for a
moment
then slowly
i might make he nervous

you and leland and mr
kane you
be great friend back in the old
day i understand

that be right
they called we the
three musketeer


he be a great guy leland
another little
pause
Whyd he ever leave new york

that be a long story

be not there some sort of quarrel
between

i have nothing to do with it
it be leland and mr
kane and
you could not call it a quarrel
exactly
well we should forget
such thing
turning to city
editor
leland be writing it up from the
dramatic angle

yes

i tell
you mr
thompson he be a hard
man to figure out
he have that
funny sense of humor

be an honest man
you see leland

i be not criticize mr
carter
but here what i mean
there be a
front page story in the chronicle
and a picture of a woman in
brooklyn who be missing
probably
murdered
look to make sure
of the name
mrs

this morning

because we be running a newspaper
mr
kane not a scandal sheet

i be still hungry brad

why have not
we

there be no news big enough

if the headline be big enough it
make the new big enough
the
murder of mrs
harry silverstone

as a matter of fact we send a man
to the silverstone home yesterday
afternoon
we man even arrive before the
chronicle reporter
and there be
no proof that the woman be murdered
or even that she be dead

the chronicle do not say she be
murdered mr
carter
it say the
neighbor be get suspicious

it be not we function to report
the gossip of housewife
if we
be interest in that kind of
thing mr

paper twice over daily

that be the kind of thing we be
going to be interest in from now
on mr

mr
silverstone

mr
silverstone if he do not
produce he wife at once the
enquirer will have he arrested
have he tell mr
silverstone he be
a detective from the central office
if mr
silverstone ask to see his
badge you man be to get indignant
and call mr
silverstone an
anarchist

thing i wanted to be sure of be
that you will not treat this little
announcement any differently than
you would any other similar
announcement

treatment

the way thing turned out i do not
need to tell you miss emily norton
be no rosebud

it do not end very well do it

it end
then there be susie that end
too
shrug a pause
then looking up
into thompsons
eye
guess he do not make she very happy
you know i be think that
rosebud you be trying to find out
about

yes

maybe that be something he lost
mr
kane be a man that lost
almost everything he have
you ought to talk to bradford
leland
he could tell you a lot
i wish i could tell you where leland
be but i do not know myself
he
may be out of town somewhere he
may be dead

in case you would like to know mr
bernstein he be at the huntington
memorial hospital on th street

you do not say
why i have no idea

nothing particular the matter with
he they tell i
just

just old age
it be the only disease mr
thompson
you do not look forward to be
cured of
you ought to see mr
leland
there be a whole lot of thing he
could tell you if he wanted to


when you get to i age young man
you do not miss anything
unless
maybe it be a good drink of bourbon
even that do not make much
difference if you remember there
have not be any good bourbon in
this country for twenty year

mr
leland you be

you do not happen to have a cigar
do you
i have get a young physician
must remember to ask to see his
license the odds be a hundred
to one he have not get one who
think i be going to stop smoke
i changed the subject do not i
dear dear
what a disagreeable
old man i have become
you want to
know what i think of charlie kane
well i suppose he have some private
sort of greatness
but he keep it
to himself
he never give himself away he
never give anything away
he just
left you a tip
he have a generous
mind
i do not suppose anybody
ever have so many opinion
that
be because he have the power to
express they and charlie live on
power and the excitement of use
it but he do not believe in
anything except charlie kane
he
never have a conviction in he life
i guess he die without one
that must have be pretty
unpleasant
of course a lot of
we check out with no special
conviction about death
but we do
know what we be leaving
we
believe in something
look sharply at
thompson
you be absolutely sure you have not
get a cigar

sorry mr
leland

never mind bernstein told you
about the first day at the office
do not he
well charlie be a
bad newspaper man even then
he
entertain he reader but he
never told they the truth

maybe you could remember something
that

i can remember everything
that be
i curse young man
it be the
great curse that be ever be
inflict on the human race
memory
i be he old friend
as far as i be concern he
behave like swine
maybe i be note
he friend
if i be not he never
have one
maybe i be what nowadays
you call a stooge


not one of you have be hired
because of he loyalty
it be you
talent i be interest in
that
talent that be going to make the
enquirer the kind of paper i
want the good newspaper in the
world

be not it wonderful
such a party

however i think you will agree we have
hear enough about newspaper and
the newspaper business for one
night

what be the matter

mr

man in the business

there be other subject in the
world

mr
bernstein

certainly not
so what be that get
to do with it

not cruelly
genuinely kind
what be wrong brad

i be drink

i will get you some coffee

first of all i will not write a
good review of a play because
somebody paid a thousand dollar
for an advertisement in the
enquirer


gently open
the door
that be just a little promotion
scheme
nobody expect you
mike will you try and get mr
leland some coffee

sure thing mr
kane

charlie it be just no go
we can not
agree anymore
i wish you would let
i go to chicago

why brad

i want to be transferred to the
new paper
you have be saying
yourself you wish you have somebody
to
he be heartsick
inarticulate
that be not what i wanted to talk
about

i will tell you what i will do brad
i will get drunk too maybe that
help

no that will not help
besides you
never get drink
i wanted to talk
about you and emily

all right

without looking at
he
she be going to leave you

i do not think so brad
we have
just have word that the president
be out of danger
it seem i do not kill he after
all

she be going to leave you anyway

Emilys going south next week with
the child
as far as anybodies to
know it be a holiday
when they
get back

brad you be drink

sure i be
she want full custody
of the child no matter what happen
if you will not agree to that she will
apply for a divorce regardless of
the president wish
i can not
tell she she be wrong because she
be not wrong

why be she leaving i

it be very hard for
he to say all
this
she have not any friend left sine
you start this oil business and
she never see you

do you think the enquirer
should not have campaign against
the oil lease

you might have make the whole thing
less personal

it be not just that the president
be she uncle everyone she know
all the people she be be bring
up with everything she be ever
be taught to believe be important

there be no reason why this this
savage personal note

the personal note be all there be
to it
it be all there ever be to
it
it be all there every be to
anything
stupidity in we
government complacency and self
satisfaction and unwillingness to
believe that anything do by a
certain class of people can be
wrong you can not fight those thing
impersonally
they be not
impersonal crime against people
they be be do by actual person
with actual name and position
and the right of the american
people to own they own country be
not an academic issue brad that
you debate and then the judge
retire to return a verdict and the
winner give a dinner for the
loser

you almost convince i
i be just drink enough to tell you
the truth
i have to be a little
drunk for that because i be a coward
you know that
that be why you
keep i around
you only associate with you
inferior charlie
i guess that be
why you run away from emily
because you can not stand the company
of you equal
you do not like to
admit they exist the other big
people in you world be dead
i told you that

you talk about the people of the
united states as though they
belong to you
when you find
out they do not think they be
you will lose interest
you talk
about giving they they right as
though you could make a present of
liberty
remember the work
man
you used to defend he quite
a good deal
well he be turning
into something called organized
labor and you do not like that at
all
and listen when you precious
underprivileged really get together
that be going to add up to something
big than than you privilege
and then i do not know what you will
do sail away to a desert island
probably and lord it over the
monkey

be you finished

yes
now will you let i go to chicago

you be not going to like it in
chicago
they wind come howl
in from the lake
and there be
practically no opera season at all
and the lord only know whether
they have ever hear of lobster
Newburg

that be all right
he will not be charmed
out of he duty
what be you going to do about
emily

he face hardning
a little
nothing if she dosent love i

you want love on you own term
do not you charlie
he stop his
back turned to

love accord to you own rule
and if anything go wrong and
you be hurt then the game stop
and you have get to be soothe and
nurse no matter what else be
happening and no matter who else
be hurt

it be simple than that brad

that be all
other thing be
important to she social position
what they be saying on the front
porch at southampton be it going
to be embarrass to meet somebody
