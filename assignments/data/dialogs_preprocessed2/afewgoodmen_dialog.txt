dawsons family have be contact
Downeys close live relative be
ginny miller he aunt on he mother

this last letter to the naval

to kill santiago

Gotcha
and santiago be
who

the victim

write that down
be i correct in assuming that these
letter do not paint a flatter
picture of marine corps life in
guantanamo bay

yes among other

and be i **further/far right in assuming
that a protract investigation of
this incident might because some
embarrassment for the security counsel
guy

colonel Jessep yes but

twelve year

down to involuntary manslaughter
twelve year

marine barracks rifle security
company windward second platoon
delta
i be writing to inform you of
i problem with i unit here in
cuba and to ask for you help
i have
fallen out on run before for several
reason such as feeling dizzy or
nauseate but on may th i would fallen
back about or yard going down
a rocky unstable hill
i sergeant
grab i and push i down the
hill
then i see all black and the
last thing i remember be hitting the
deck
i be bring to the hospital
where i be tell i just have heat
exhaustion and be explain to by
the doctor that i body have trouble
with the hot sun and i hyperventilate
i ask you to help i
please sir
i
just need to be transferred out of

sincerely
william
santiago
you

marine corps







in exchange for i transfer
off the base i be will to provide
you with information about an illegal
fenceline shoot that occur the
night of august nd


who the fuck be william
santiago

sir santiago be a member of second
platoon delta

yeah well apparently he be not very
happy down here at ShangriLa because
he be written letter to everyone but
santa claus asking for a transfer
and now he be telling tale about a
fenceline shoot

matthew

i be appal sir

you be appal
this kid broke the
chain of command and he rat on a
man of he unit to say nothing of
the fact that he be a you

marine and
it would appear that he can not run
from here to there without collapsing
from heat exhaustion
what the fuck
going on over at windward matthew

colonel i think perhaps it would be
well to hold this discussion in
private

that will not be necessary colonel
i will handle the situation

the same way you handle the curtis
barnes incident
you be do
something wrong lieutenant this

i method of leadership be

do not interrupt i i be still you
superior officer

and i be yours matthew

i want to know what we be going to do
about this

i think santiago should be transferred
off the base
right away

he be that bad huh

not only that but word of this
letter bound to get out
the kid
going to get he ass kick

transfer santiago
yes i suppose
you be right
i suppose that be the
thing to do
wait
wait
i have get a
good idea
let we transfer the whole
squad off the base
let we on second
think windward
the whole
windward division let we transfer
they off the base
jon go on out
there and get those boy down off
the fence they be packing they
bag
tom

sir

get i the president on the phone
we be surrender we position in
cuba

yes sir

wait a minute tom

do not call the president just yet
maybe we should consider this for a
second
maybe and i be just spit
ball here but maybe we as
officer have a responsibility to
train santiago
maybe we as officer
have a responsibility to this country
to see that the man and woman charged
with it security be trained
professional
yes
i be certain i
once read that somewhere
and now
i be think that you suggestion of
transfer santiago while
expeditious and certainly painless
might not be in a manner of speaking
the american way
santiago stay
where he be
we be going to train the
lad
you be in charge jon
santiago
do not make
on he next fitness
report i be going to blame you
then
i be going to kill you

yes sir

i think that be a mistake colonel

matthew i believe i will have that
word in private with you now
jon
that be all
why do not you and i have
lunch at the club we will talk
about the train of young william

yes sir i would be delight to hear
any suggestion you have

dismiss

matthew sit please

what do you think of kendrick

i do not know that

i think he be kind of a weasel myself
but he be an awfully good officer
and in the end we see eye to eye on
the good way to run a marine corps
unit
we be in the business of save
life matthew
that be a
responsibility we have to take pretty
seriously
and i believe that take
a marine who be not yet up to the job
and packing he off to another
assignment put live in danger

matthew siddown
we go back a while
we go to the
academy together we be commission
together we do we tour in vietnam
together
but i have be promote up
through the chain with great speed
and success than you have
now if
that be a source of tension or
embarrassment for you well i do not
give a shit
we be in the business
of save live captain Markinson

front of another officer

dawson and private downey

alexander randolph be preside
god
save the united states of america

no objection you honor

no objection

be the government prepared to make
an open statement

yes sir

the fact of the case be this
at
midnight on august th the defendant
go into the barracks room of they
platoonmate william santiago
they wake he up tied he arm and
leg with rope and forced a rag
into he throat
few minute later
a chemical reaction in Santiagos
body called lactic acidosis cause
he lung to begin bleed
he
drowned in he own blood and be
pronounced dead at minute past
midnight
these be the fact of the
case
and they be undisputed
that be
right
the story i just told you be
the exact same story you be going to
hear from corporal dawson and it be
the exact same story you be going to
hear from private downey
furthermore
the government will also demonstrate
that the defendant soaked the rag
with poison and entered Santiagos
room with motive and intent to kill
now lt
Kaffee be going to try to
pull off a little magic act he be
going to try a little misdirection
he be going to astonish you with
story of ritual and dazzle you
with official sound term like
code red
he might even cut into a
few officer for you
he will have no
evidence mind you none
but it be
going to be entertain
when we get
to the end all the magic in the
world will not have be able to
divert you attention from the fact
that willy santiago be dead and
dawson and downey killed he
these
be the fact of the case
and they be undisputed

lt
Kaffee

there be no poison on the rag and
there be no intent to kill and any
attempt to prove otherwise be futile
because it just be not true
when dawson and downey go into
Santiagos room that night it be not
because of vengeance or hatred it
be not to kill or harm and it be not
because they be looking for kick
on a friday night
it be because it
be what they be ordered to do
let i say that again
it be because
it be what they be ordered to do
now out in the real world that
mean nothing
and here at the
washington navy yard it do not
mean a whole lot more
but if you be
a marine assign to rifle security
company windward guantanamo bay
cuba and you be given an order you
follow it or you pack you bag
make no mistake about it harold
dawson and louden downey be sitting

angry

object

be dawson and downey

please the court be the judge
advocate honestly asking this witness
to testify as to how the defendant
feel on august th

sustained

corporal do lt
kendrick leave a
standing order at that meet

yes sir

what be it

well it be clear that he do not
want we to take matter into we own
hand sir

what be the order

sir he said that santiago be not to
be touched

you witness

corporal Hammaker be you in dawson
and Downeys barracks room ten minute
after this meet

no sir

thanks i have no more question

the government call corporal raymond
thomas

please the court i understand lt
ross be planning on calling all the
other member of rifle security
company windward to testify

in light of the defense that lt
Kaffee be planning to mount the
explicit instruction of the platoon
leader seem particularly relevant
testimony

the defense be will to concede
that all witness will testify
substantially as corporal Hammaker
do if the government be will to
concede that none of they be in
dawson and Downeys room at
on
august th

lieutenant

the Governmentll agree to the
stipulation sir

then we will adjourn for the day
you
can call you next witness in the
morning




and he be pronounced dead at
zerozerothirtyseven

dr
stone what be lactic acidosis

if the muscle and other cell of
the body burn sugar instead of oxygen
lactic acid be produced
that lactic
acid be what cause Santiagos lung
to bleed

how long do it take for the muscle
and other cell to begin burn
oxygen instead of sugar

twenty to thirty minute

and what cause Santiagos muscle
and other cell to start burn
sugar

an ingest poison of some kind

you honor we object at this point
the witness be speculate

commander stone be an expert medical
witness in this courtroom he opinion
be not considered speculation

commander stone be an internist not
a criminologist and the medical
fact here be ultimately
inconclusive

point which i be confident you will
illustrate to the jury under cross
examination so i be sure you will not
mind if he opinion be admitted now

not at all sir
objection withdraw

doctor stone do willy santiago die
of poison

absolutely

be you aware that the lab report
and the coroner report show no
trace of poison

yes i be

then how do you justify

there be literally dozens of toxin
which be virtually undetectable
both in the human body and on a
fabric
the nature of the acidosis
be the compel factor in this
issue

thank you sir

commander you testify that it
take lactic acidosis to minute
before it become lethal

yes

let i ask you be it possible for a
person to have an affliction some
sort of condition which might in
the case of this person actually
speed up the process of acidosis
dramatically

commander be it possible

certainly

what might some of those condition
be

if a person have a coronary disorder
or a cerebral disorder the process
would be more rapid

commander if i have a coronary
condition and a perfectly clean rag
be place in i mouth and the rag
be accidentally push too far down
be it possible that i cell would
continue burn sugar after the rag
be taken out

it would have to be a very serious
condition

be it possible to have a serious
coronary condition where the initial
warn signal be so mild as to
escape a physician during a routine
medical exam

possibly
there would still be
symptom though

what kind of symptom

there be hundreds of symptom of a

chest pain

yes

shortness of breath

yes

fatigue

of course

doctor be this you signature

yes it be

this in an order for private santiago
to be put on restrict duty
would
you read you hand written remark
at the bottom of the page please
sir

initial test negative
patient
complain of chest pain shortness
of breath and fatigue
restricted
from running distance over five
mile for one week


commander be not it possible that
santiago have a serious coronary
condition and it be that condition
and not some mysterious poison that
cause the accelerate chemical
reaction

no
i personally give the man a
physical examination every three
month
and every three month private
santiago get a clean bill of health

and that be why it have to be poison
right commander
because lord know
if you put a man with a serious
coronary condition back on duty with
a clean bill of health and that man
die from a heart relate incident
you would have a lot to answer for
would not you doctor

object
move to strike

sustained
strike it

no more question judge

dr
stone you have hold a license to
practice medicine for year you
be board certify in internal
medicine you be the chief of
internal medicine at a hospital which
serve over man
in you

to commander stone testimony and
ask that it be stricken from the
record

weight to this witness testimony

the objection overrule counsel

sir the defense strenuously object
and request a meet in chamber
so that he honor might have an
opportunity to hear discussion before
ruling on the objection

the objection of the defense have
be hear and overrule

yes

do you report private barnes to the
proper authority

i have two book at i bedside
lieutenant the marine code of conduct
and the king james bible
the only
proper authority i be aware of be
i commanding officer colonel nathan

Jessep and the lord we god

lt
kendrick at you request i can
have the record reflect you lack of
acknowledgment of this court as a
proper authority

objection
argumentative

sustained
watch yourself counselor

do you report private barnes to
you superior

i remember think very highly of
private barnes and not wanting to
see he record tarnish by a formal
charge

you preferred it to be handle within
the unit

i most certainly do

lieutenant do you know what a code
red be

yes i do

have you ever ordered a code red

no i have not

lieutenant do you order dawson and
two other man to make sure that
private barnes receive no food or
drink except water for a period of
seven day

that be a distortion of the truth
private barnes be place on barracks
restriction
he be given water and
vitamin supplement and i assure
you that at no time be he health
in danger

i be sure it be lovely for private
barnes but you do order the barracks
restriction do not you
and you do
order the denial of food

yes

would not this form of discipline be
considered a code red

not necessarily

if i called the other man at
guantanamo bay to testify would
they consider it a code red

please the court the witness can not
possibly testify as to what
other man would say
we object to
this entire line of questioning as
argumentative and irrelevant badgering
of the witness

the government objection be
sustain lt
Kaffee and i would
remind you that you be now questioning
marine officer with an impeccable
service record

thank you judge

lieutenant be dawson given a rate
of below average on this last fitness
report because you learned hold be
sneak food to private barnes
not so fast
lieutenant

corporal dawson be find to be below
average because he committed a crime

what crime do he commit
lieutenant kendrick
dawson bring a hungry guy some
food
what crime do he commit

he disobey an order

and because he do because he
exercise he own set of value
because he make a decision about the
welfare of a marine that be in
conflict with an order of yours he
be punished be that right

corporal dawson disobey an order

yeah but it be not a order be it
after all it be peacetime
he be not
be ask to secure a hill
or
advance on a beachhead
i mean surely
a marine of dawsons intelligence
can be trusted to determine on his
own which be the really important
order and which order might say
be morally questionable
lt
kendrick
can he
can corporal dawson determine
on he own which order he be going to
follow

no he can not

lesson he learned after the curtis
barnes incident be i right

i would think so

you know so do not you lieutenant

object

sustained

lieutenant kendrick one final
question
if you ordered dawson to
give santiago a code red

please the court

i told those man not to touch
santiago

be it reasonable to think that he
would have disobey you again

lieutenant do not answer that

you do not have to i be through

lieutenant kendrick do you order
corporal dawson and private downey
to give willy Santiaga code red

lt
kendrick do you

no i do not

thank you

question

yes lieutenant
i be given an order
by i squad leader lance corporal
harold
dawson of the you

marine
corps
and i follow it

where do you think he be

as far as downey be concern it
be an order from kendrick
it do not
matter that he do not hear it first
hand
he do not distinguish between
the two

danny
i be sorry

do not worry about it

sam and i be just talking about
how all we really have to do be call
some witness who will talk about
imply order
or maybe we put
downey back on the stand before we
get to dawson

maybe if we work at it we can get
dawson charge with the kennedy
assassination

be you drink

pretty much
yeah

i will make a pot of coffee
we have a
long night work ahead

she be going to make coffee
that be nice
he be not in he room
he be not even there
that be an important piece of
information do not you think

danny it be just a setback
i be
sorry
but we will fix it and then
move on to Markinson

Markinsons dead

you really get to hand it to those
federal marshal boy
he almost have to
laugh
it be not like he hanged himself by
he shoelace or slash he wrist
with a conceal butter knife
this
guy get into full dress uniform
stand in the middle of that room
draw a nickle plated pistol from his
holster and fired a bullet into his
mouth

anyway since we seem to be out of
witness i think i would drink a
little

i still think we can win

then maybe you should drink a little

look we will go to randolph in the
morning and make a motion for a
continuance
hour

why would we want to do that

to subpoena colonel Jessep

what

listen for a second

no

just hear i out

no
i will not listen to you and i will not
hear you out
you passion be
comfort jo
it be also useless
private downey needed a trial lawyer
today

you chickenshit
you be going to use
what happen today as an excuse to
give up

it be over

why do you ask Jessep for the
transfer order

what be you

in cuba
why do you ask Jessep for
the transfer order

what do it matter

why

i wanted the damn transfer order

bullshit
you could have get it by
picking up the phone and calling any
one of a dozen department at the
pentagon
you do not want the transfer
order
you wanted to see Jesseps
reaction when you ask for the
transfer order
you have an instinct
and it be confirmed by Markinson
now damnit let we put Jessep on the
stand and end this thing

what possible good could come from
putting Jessep on the stand

he told kendrick to order the code
red

he do
why do not you say so
that be qreat
and of course you have
proof of that

i

ah i keep forget
you be sick
the day they taught law at law school

you put he on the stand and you get
it from he

yes
no problem
we get it from he
colonel be not it true that you
ordered the code red on santiago

look we be all a little

i be sorry you time run out
what
do we have for the loser judge
well for we defendant it be a
lifetime at exotic fort Levenworth
and for defense counsel Kaffee
that be
right it be a court martial

a marine officer of conspiracy lt
Kaffee will have a long and prosperous
career teach typewriter maintenance

paper on you father in college

no

you think i father would have

with the evidence we have get

and there be really no way of get
around this neither lionel Kaffee
nor sam weinberg be lead counsel
for the defense in the matter of
you

versus dawson and downey

there be only one question
what would
you do

transfer order

what be the transfer order without a
witness

bound

habit of william santiago

colonel i have just one more question
before i call airman OMalley and
airman perez
if you give an order
that santiago be not to be touched
and you order be always follow
then why would he be in danger why
would it be necessary to transfer
he off the base

private santiago be a substandard
marine
he be be transferred off
the base because

but that be not what you said
you
said he be be transferred because
he be in grave danger

yes
that be correct but

you said he be in danger
i said
grave danger
you said

yes i recall what

i can have the court reporter read
back you

i know what i said
i do not need it
read back to i like i be a damn

then why the two order
colonel
why do you

sometimes man take matter into they
own hand

no sir
you make it clear just a
moment ago that you man never take
matter into they own hand
you
man follow order or people die
so
santiago should not have be in any
danger at all should he have
colonel

you little bastard

you honor i have to ask for a recess
to

i would like an answer to the question
judge

the Courtll wait for answer

if kendrick told he man that santiago
be not to be touched then why do
he have to be transferred

colonel

kendrick ordered the code red do not
he
because that be what you told
kendrick to do

backbone to a life spent defending
something
you use they as a punchline

inclination to explain myself to a
man who rise and sleep under the
blanket of the very freedom i provide
then question the manner in which i
provide it
