the furniture be simple some of it hand make
a
small bed against the wall a little write desk in one
corner stacked with book litter with paper more mail

appointed secretary the young man we
meet near the train who at the mention of sex blush a
little

but sex

not an easy age for abstinence
be it

tolstoy do not approve of
sexual relation
i know this

he despise they in fact
Chertkov reach for a small tin of moustache wax

i do not want to belabor the
point but i arranged for a
manservant last year who
proceed to ruin two housemaid

Valentins face flush with pride
Chertkov steal a
glance at he reflection in the glass bookcase

he moustache droop a little
he tug awkwardly at it

become Tolstoys private
secretary you would be given a
great gift

sofya sasha valentin Tolstoys son and tolstoy
all cluster around a table taking tea
Dushan stand near
the group fiddling with a gramophone that sit on a small
table

these people have nothing


it really be the most
extraordinary thing
absolutely ignore he

it be not for lack of land that
the muzhiks live in poverty
they have no will power and they
drink too much

i be not suggest they be given
land
private property be the
root of the problem
we should
be giving ours away

give it to whom

it be all ridiculous
you think
that poverty make the peasant
somehow morally superior

i believe that wealth corrupt we
all yes i do
pause
valentin fill the silence

it be a keystone of the movement

oh i know all about the
movement
pause
valentin notice that people from the front lawn
have moved up to watch all this
life in the fishbowl the
Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care

if the peasant have money they
would not surround themselves as
we do with footman costing ten
ruble a month

no they would spend it on drink and
whore

valentin Fedorovich do you think
fifty year from now people will
eat while grow man walk around
and wait on they hand and foot

valentin do not know what to say
giggle from Dushan

oh that be good
that be good
Dushan have sit at table try surreptitiously to get
down Tolstoys word in the diary he hold below the table
sofya flush with anger

i think

stop scribbling
you all think he be christ do not
you
he think he be christ
there be an awkward pause

i be not
i do not believe leo
nikolayevich be christ
christ be
christ but

but what

i believe he be one of the
prophet
god speak through he
i recognize the cadence in his
voice

this be unbearable
no wonder i
feel lonely
i be surround by
morrons

mama you be be ridiculous

be i
i sit here and listen to
this talk of love and god and
equality knowing full well that
count generosity here be fully
prepared to give away everything
we have

you keep going on like that
why
do you think we should profit
from the work i m do which be
only mean for the sake of the
people

she turn to see Dushan scribbling again



valentin glance at sasha uncomfortable at these
outburst
long pause
Dushan try to relieve the
tension

in defense of i gift let i
demonstrate
it be quite
remarkable really
he get up place a record on the gramophone needle on
the record
what come forth be not music but Tolstoys
voice
it be a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment
he voice boom tinny and distort
Dushan
walk to the machine stare at it in awe
valentin be
completely catch up in the technology

it be you voice
it be wonderful
they all listen for a moment look to tolstoy for a
response

it be tiresome
another
remarkable invention will
supercede it
valentin blush and look at the table
Dushan try to
hide he disappointment

please excuse i
tolstoy rise leaf the table walk out onto the lawn
Dushan get up quickly bumping the table as he go
tea
spill
valentin move to wipe it up sneeze a barrage of
irritable blessing

leo nikolayevich be something of
a luddite i fear
sofya cross to the machine remove the record from the
gramophone replace it with another Dushan have bring
suddenly the air be filled with the final duet from
mozarts il Nozze di figaro
she return to she place

be it
they help tolstoy dismount
they lead he to a nearby stump
and place the write board before he
Sergeyenko hand a
document to Chertkov who lay it on the board

this will insure that the
complete works will live in the
public domain

Monumentous

the russian people
now they
possess it forever
tolstoy look up at they

circling again
without far hesitation tolstoy pick up the pen and
sign the document

valentin watch he




valentin and tolstoy water they horse at a stream
tolstoy seem weary

so i write down a
string of letter and ask she
if she could decipher they

tolstoy look into the middle distance remembering he
love

i give she one clue
the first
two ys i said stand for you
youth and then the most
miraculous thing happen
she
simply speak the phrase i
phrase
tolstoy look at valentin as if the boy might offer some
explanation of the miraculous

as if she have read i mind
in that moment we both know we
would always be together
for
those first year we be
incredibly happy terrifyingly
happy
he old eye be wet

and now this
tolstoy reach into he boot extract he
