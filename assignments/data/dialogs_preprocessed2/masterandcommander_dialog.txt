i know you
be close to he father

one moment jack let i look at that brow
of yours

it a scratch

i will tell you if it a scratch or not
sit down

how do he find we stephen
seven week sailing and he happen in
darkness on we exact position
it
uncanny
he really be a phantom

unless she be alert to we presence
and looking for we

tosh
how could that be

the french have they spy in britain
as elsewhere

you be saying there be traitor in the
admiralty

i be saying do not imagine it be a lone
privateer who do this to we
he be
working for napoleon himself with access
to all that tyrant command overtly and
covertly
so do not let defeat weigh too
heavily upon you

call she a frigate
ha
you ask i
she be no more a frigate than a painted
dutchman
more like a ship of the line a
twodecker moreen a frigate

one do wonder what manner of hull she
have
we ball seem to bounce right off
she

she have the weathergauge and long
eighteens which could hit we beyond we
effective range
that be the sum of it

and gun to we i count the
muzzle flash

it be an unfair match no dishonor in
defeat no dishonor at all

well we can patch up we main and mizzen
the foresail be too far go so we will
bend we spare

sir

mr
allen be confident with basic
repair we can get home as we be
allow for a stop in jamaica

at port royal we can haul she into dry
dock and hopefully get she home
without

we be not going home

what be we purpose here gentleman
why
be we send
to punish a blackguard
privateer who have decimate we atlantic
whale fleet and now threaten to do the
same in the pacific
be we to leave
those ship to he mercy and slink back
into portsmouth another defeat to add
to the list
be that what we draw we
wage for
i say we pursue she and pay
she back with interest

with respect captain she could be half
way to cape horn by the time we be
repaired and underway

then there be not a moment to lose

we be for the horn

the horn you say
never
in this condition
eh
what news mate
heading for where
higgins
we be for hell in a handbarrow if you
ask i opinion
slade
i be game
if the captain say we can take
she we can take she

can we catch she be the question
and if we do what be different
she will
just hold we off with they long eighteens
til she send we all to the bottom
all
for what

i will tell you for what matey
she be a
privateer loaded with all the gem of
araby
think of the gold
think of the
prizemoney

all thought of home forsaken
where duty lead we there we go

the first time he said to i may i
trouble you for the salt sir
i have
always tried to say it as close as i
could the second time someone have
offered he a boatcloak on a cold night
and he said no he be quite warm his
zeal for he king and country keep he
warm

it sound absurd i know and be it
another man you would cry out oh what
pitiful stuff and dismiss it as mere
enthusiasm but with he you feel you
heart glow

to lord nelson

lord nelson

you see those two weevil doctor

i do

which would you choose

there be not a scrap of difference
they
be the same species of curculio

but suppose you have to choose

then i would choose the righthand
weevil it have a perceptible advantage in
both length and breadth

there i have you
you be completely
dish
do not you know in the navy you
must always choose the lesser of two
weevil

pon i life
he who would pun would pick
a pocket
dye not smoke it doctor

sure there would be some poor thin barren
mind that would catch at such a paltry
clench


and the righteous shall inherit the
earth


you hear that
he said something
joe
speak
say something else joe

handy with that gasket

he speak doctor
joe plaice speak

we captain be very good to we
he dip he prick in phosphorus
it she would a light all through the night
and steered we through the bosphorus

farewell and adieu you fine spanish
lady farewell and adieu to you lady
of spain

what a wonderfully true voice mr
Hollom
do possess

warn take by i
and never leave you happy home
to sail the rage sea

this one by Colnett sir
he travel
with captain cook and carry a pair of
Arnotts chronometer

couple of the man to see you sir

show they in

what be this

it be Warleys idea sir

i think she be familiar like then i
remember where i would see she in
boston during the peace

in boston

yes sir
she be yankee build
i see they
working on she something right strange
about she scantling
then i see they
ball bounce off she an i get to
think

if you look here sir
one side open up

mister nagel here do it just like i
see she a third layer atween the
outer and inner ribbing diagonal
bracing see

just like the you

constitution we
pounder could not penetrate except at
close range

killick
killick there

an extra ration of rum for these man
from i private store

which i be saving for saluting day sir

rouse it up killick and a bottle for
mr
and i
let we live whilst
we be alive

he be vulnerable here

cross she stern rake she with a
broadside through she length
but how to
get close enough
past those long
eighteens
that be the devil of it

he say they be chase for three day
till they finally ourran she
forty gun
french privateer headed due south

capital
thank he and let we be off

what do he say there

spanish farewell
may no new thing
arrive
new thing be generally by
they nature bad

do you have a manual of exercise sir

exercise

physical exercise to make the leave arm
as powerful as the right once be

i think that will happen with usage at
least to a certain extent

but not completely
i will never be whole
again will i

no but you will adapt to you new
situation
the natural world show we any number of
example of how that be possible

you know i father be a great fight
captain
it be always he expectation i
would follow in he footstep
i worry
that with this arm i will now be good for
nothing but book learn and philosophy

ah
like i you mean

i cannot use a sextant cannot tie a knot
or climb the rig
Cannot even dress
myself
what chance to i have now of even
making first lieutenant

you have every chance
you hear i every
chance
only the other day i hear the
captain singing you praise
you
courage you fortitude in battle you
skill at logarithm and double elevation
whatever they may be
and when you be
rate lieutenant you shall have someone
to tie you bootlace for you
aye and
help you with you jacket
here take i
handkerchief
i believe we be summonse
to dinner

sail on the larboard bow

where away

hull down two point off the larboard
beam



she be a frigate all right but no way of
knowing if she be the phantom

set studdingsails and top gallant
then
wet the sail and have the idler place
along the rail

be it he sir

touch wood mr
blakeney
and i fancy
she plan to outrun we
ask dr
maturin
to join we he love a good chase

lifeline fore and aft

speed mr
calamy

twelve knot sir

we be cracking on eh

we will be cracking off presently if he
do not watch it

no he know this ship
he know what she
can take

we can just see she topsails
she be make
she turn westwards

i can not vouch for the mizzen sir not
round cape horn

i will not lose she now
set a course
westwards

mr hollar rig preventer backstays
warp
and light hawser to the masthead

well get below mr
Pullings

what sir

well get some food in you
before it
turn nasty

you reckon captain will keep chasing he
around the horn with every stitch of
canvas fly

i reckon he would chase he to the gate of
hell if he have to

and that be where we be all going if he
do not take in sail

strike the topgallants

cape horn doctor

help they with that mizzen topgallant
you go too mr
Hollom

man overboard

swim for the wreckage man

reduce sail

she be broach

it be acting as a seaanchor
we must cut
it loose sir

axe/axis

set to then
set to

all hand to the pump

he be be at it again

who be that then

the jonah

what jonah

the death in actual battle be the
easy
for i own part those who die under the
knife or from some consequent infection
i have to remind myself that it be the
enemy who killed they and not i
warley be a casualty of war as surely
as if a french ball have taken he

at the same time
jack
at the same time what

you know that i wear two hat on every
voyage
i be the captain particular
friend and supporter but also i be the
ship doctor in which late capacity i be
party to

you do not want i to continue

on the contrary
i insist on it

there be talk below deck of turning
back
or rather that we should have
turned back some week ago
of course the
man would follow lucky jack anywhere
and usually in the confident expectation
of victory
but that of course be the
problem

what be the problem

that you be not accustom to defeat
jack
that you have taken it too
personally
that chasing this large
fast ship with it long gun be
beginning to smack of pride which goeth
before destruction

it be not pride nor anything like it it be
a question of duty

duty ah yes
the naval signal for end
of discussion

you can be as satiric as you like
stephen but i have i order
she be
attack we whaler
for why
without
whale we have no boot polish nor any
soap nor oil for we lamp not to oil
we sabre and musket
destroy we
whaler could win the war for napoleon
which be why we must catch this Acheron
as a man of learn surely you can see
that

at whatever the cost

any whatever cost i choose to pay
and i
will calculate that myself stephen
without reference to you friend in the
ward room

cast off

belay
sorry
sorry

we will have to go far south get
around this bloody west wind

how far south

as far as be necessary mr
Pullings
the
sixtieth parallel if need be


then we upon the globe last verge shall
go to view the ocean leaning on the sky
from thence we roll neighbour we
shall know
and on the hide world securely pry

rise and shine
show a leg there tumble
up tumble up sleeper awake

praise be
at last

pray what be there to celebrate

we have make we turn northward doctor
we be headed back toward the sun

in anticipation of which
i ask
killick to prepare something special
killick
killick there

which i be just coming

gentleman i give you
we destination

pon i word so it be

slice of Albermale

you
the doldrum be a condition not a
region
but you tend to strike they
here
between the trade and the
easterly
i hope the Acheron be
have it as bad as we be

assume he be heading for the galapago
and not some other point in all this
vastness

come
i would have think you would be delight
to go there
it be say to be a natural
paradise

in truth i would be delight with the mere
guano stain rock provided it do not
sway beneath i foot

well we will take on food and water once

have put ashore in brazil i pledge that
during that time several day at least

man must be govern
often not wisely i
grant you but there be hierarchy even

tyrant in history
of nero
of Boneparte

yes
fine word i be sure

we be not animal and i for one am
opposed to authority that egg of misery
and oppression

very fine word stephen but in these
current circumstance hardwork and firm
discipline be what keep we little
wooden world together

and grog i suppose

of course
what of it

have they grog

you know nagel be drunk when he insult
Hollom
and higgins be never sober
even
the midshipman

the man will have they grog stephen
it
be part of the immemorial tradition of
the service

well a shameful tradition it be too
to
have they pressed from they home keep
in a permanent state of dull inebriation

stephen

confined for month in a wooden
prison never more than a few hour sleep
and flog when drunken idleness drive
they to

stephen
i warn you that friend or no
i will not have you talk of the service
like that

turn the glass and strike the bell




Landho

give you joy sir
we have raised the
galapagos

can not see any wimmun
just lots of duck
and lizard

wot
there must be wimmun
be not
natural

how extraordinary

what sir

those bird

species of cormorant
but apparently
flightless by all that be holy
i believe
that be unknown to science

the dragon do not seem to bother they

they be a type of iguana i should think
and therefore vegetarian

will you catch one

yes
most certainly
and if we can some
egg

i mean the great lizard

oh

i should think a pair of they
then you
can present one of they offspring to the
king

ha
there be one going for a swim

no
iguana be land animal

not these one



by jove Bonden you be right
two new
species in as many minute

what be all that confound bellowing

all hand about ship

by you leave sir by you leave

helms lee off tack and sheet
mainsail haul

god bless you
thank you shipmate

we be coming back for fresh line hide
in that inlet yonder
Blackthree
master
bit beamy and raised in the
stern

hundred thousand pound of good whale oil
they steal
then the bastard

no swearing on the quarterdeck

go on

then they burn we bloody ship and
headed off bunch of fugging pirate

and she course

maybe a point south of west
following
the rest of the whale fleet

mr
Mowett these man to be enter on
the ship book
mr
allen lay a course
west west

should we not take on fresh supply
sir
those tortoise

there be not a moment to lose mr
Pullings

have you forgotten you promise

subject to the requirement of the
service stephen
i could not in all
conscience delay for the sake of an
iguano or a
giant peccary
interest no doubt but of no immediate
application

how can you dismiss out of hand the
bounty of nature
knowledge that
that
will help to progress

i can see nothing on shore that will
progress we mission

but how can we possibly know what lie
on these island perhaps some
knowledge that may save life that

i will tell you how to save live
stephen
inform i how to guide this
ship undetected under the nose of a
gun frigate
that be the job in hand sir

well perhaps there be an opportunity to
serve both we objective
as i
understand it you mean to go round the
end of this long island then start you
voyage
i could walk across it be on the
other side long before

i would walk briskly pause only for
important measurement and almost
certainly making valuable discovery

if wind and tide have be against we i
should have say yes
they be not and i
be oblige to say no
no

i see
so after all this time in you
service i must simply be content to form
part of this belligerent expedition
hurry past inestimable wonder bent
solely on destruction

you forget yourself sir

no jack you have forgotten you self
you once believe in the right of each
individual man no matter how useless or
lowly
but it seem to i now that the
long exercise of power have bring you to
the point where even a solemn promise

the promise be conditional

a promise to a friend of ten year
standing who have stand by you and
supported you

i command a kings ship not a private
yacht

across half the world ocean often at
risk to he own life

and we have no time for you damn
hobby sir

sir i find a curious beetle walking on
the deck

i think it be a galapagos beetle sir

i be sure of it

be you to have walk all day on the
island you might never have come across
it

that be more than likely sure

you can have it

thank you mr
blakeney

no music
that be a shame

i will just leave the one plate then if
himself will not be joining

yes killick

on deck there
object fine on the
starboard bow

Marthas vineyard

what they call a bedford hog in new
england

the Acheron touched at boston

and it be not be in the water more than
a week

one can not say with any accuracy but

yes you can
there be no sea chummer on
it and the dowel be sound

continue due west mr
Bonden


have you see the bird doctor

i have not no bird these many day
what kind of a bird

sort of albatross i believe or perhaps
a prodigious great mew
he have be
following the ship since
there he be
crossing we wake

i be so sorry
the bird
drop low
i do not see you there

calamy

walk

you will just make it bad
by
prodding mr
higgins it cannot be get
at
except by opening i up

the bullet take a piece of shirt in with
it
unless it be remove it will
suppurate and fester

be you equal to the task

i will need to read up on the doctor
book like
study some picture he have
get i bearing
be good on land but
i will manage somehow

you man get about you business

sail on the horizon sir
hull down
running west
it may be a couple of day
before we can catch she

it might be the Acheron
if we put on
more sail we would come up with she before
nightfall

davies
slade

doctor
you be still with we
can we move
you onto a stretcher

it be because of higgins
can not have he poke around in you
belly without a solid platform to work
on

all set higgins

not higgins
i do this with i own hand

you be sure you have a head and a
stomach for this kind of thing

i dear doctor i have see blood and
wound since i be a little boy

then hold i belly pressing firmly when
i give the word

and be a kind of FightingNaturalist
like yourself

shall we take a tour of you aviary

should you really be up

yes
Padeen

how long do the captain intend that we
stay here do you know

oh a week perhaps
there be no great
hurry

but surely we must make haste for the
marquesas

it may not have be the Acheron that we
sight
nor can we be sure of she
destination
no i think we shall go home now before
peace break out with france god forbid

but how will it sit with the admiralty
to have spent six month in a fruitless
pursuit and then come home emptyhanded

Emptyhanded
not a bit of it
what
about these plant and animal which
blakeney have be collecting
the british
museum will need an entire new wing for
they

i fear jack you have burdened i with a
debt i can never repay

tosh
name a shrub after i
something
prickly and hard to eradicate

shrub
i shall name a giant tortoise
Testudo Aubreii

doctor would you think it very
unscientific of i to ride on the back of
one of those tortoise

no mr
blakeney
i would think it an
experiment of absolutely vital
importance
but afterwards i do desire
to find that flightless cormorant
assuming that be what it be and that i
still have strength enough to catch it

sir you must hurry

moment
you be a bad tyrant than any
ship captain

you must carry he Padeen

leave they
we must get back to the ship
