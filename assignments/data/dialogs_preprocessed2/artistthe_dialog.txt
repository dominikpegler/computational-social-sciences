leaving behind the impassive butler


in the lobby george be preparing to leave the house

a dog


we be on a film set the crew be setting up a shot
the
director be unhappy with a screen position behind a bay
window and he send it off

title card
remove that screen and bring i another one
on
the double
two hand pick up the screen and carry it away
george

he sit down on the
chair which bear he name
the producer whom we see the
previous day at the premiere arrive
he name be zimmer and
he be flank by and follow around at every moment by
two secretary and two assistant
one of they hand he the
hollywood reporter and zimmer before he be even come to a
halt talk to george as he show he the front page
he be
visibly upset
george look a lot more relaxed he say hello
and vaguely try to reassure he
but zimmer persist still
pointing at the newspaper
title card
because of this childish nonsense there be
nothing about the film before page
behind george the two set hand come back with a new screen
of sky scenery and wait standing just next to george
as
they be holding it there be a three foot gap underneath
while the producer be talking to he georges attention be
draw by a lovely pair of woman leg that have come to
stand behind the screen the top half of the body be
hidden by it
george acknowledge the sight with a smile and
be about to bring he attention back to the ongoing
discussion when he attention be draw away again by a
noise that of the tap step the female leg be making
presumably as a warm up
george smile in recognition and
respond with a few tap step of he own
the woman leg
instantly stop seem to think a moment and then answer back
but with a jump in the complexity of the step
tap
dialogue ensue between the two pair of leg until the set
hand the path before they now clear pick up they
screen of scenery and walk off with it
the screen move away
and as it disappear reveal that the upper body belong to a
young woman
she pull a face meaning here i be
and of
course it be peppy except that she immediately realize who
she be dealing with visibly she be not expect this at
all and feel completely ridiculous and uncomfortable
she joyful expression gradually become one of abject
apology but george be roar with laughter
after a short pause zimmer make the connection
he check
the front page of the paper and recognize she
then he begin shouting at she and all she can do be lower
she head unable to reply
he gesture that she be fired and
for she to get out and she start to go completely
distraught
she be just make a couple of step when george
stop she and tell she to come back
everyone be surprise
most of all he
zimmer can not believe it and so do not
respond at first

so be not sharing the same special moment as she

the next morning peppy bring breakfast into georges room

storeroom in which everything be covered up with sheet
he
close the door behind he
the room have a ghostly quality to
it
jack sniff about everywhere
george too seem trouble by
the strange pervade atmosphere
he curiosity be spur by
a convolute object that be covered in a thin cloth
ray of
light surge into the room
the door have open and standing
against the daylight be a maid
title card

george nod with a smile
the maid leaf pretty swiftly we
have not see she face the whole moment seem rather strange

jack be reluctant to go but finally obey he master


screenplay lie on a table
peppy and zimmer be seated
either side of the table and be talking animatedly
we be on
the set we see the previous day and peppy seem to be trying
to convince zimmer of something
she seem to be describe a
film poster or the facade of a movie theater she would love to see
he do not seem too enthusiastic from the look of the negative
shake of he head and he apologetic air as he listen to
peppy
she finally stop talking and give he a determine
look
zimmer uncomfortable and sorry calmly reply
title card
george be a silent movie actor
he belong to the
past
today he be a nobody
as Zimmers speaking she remove she accessory and hat

zimmer still be not sure he be understood
he just look at
she
title card

even when she be blackmail she be still pretty and zimmer
look at she totally at a loss but at the same time it be
obvious that he be going to back down
the people around they
be listening in on they conversation and seem to be waiting
for he decision
there be an element of dejavu to the
situation and zimmer who already backed down a few year
before give in
title card
and why not
she smile at he pick up the screenplay with delight and
leave
as he move away she whistle at he
he turn round
and she vigorously blow he a kiss


the screenplay lie on the front seat of a car
the camera
pull back it be clifton who be in the drive seat


george be lying in bed when he former chauffeur come in
at
first he be delight to see he but this turn into
astonishment and he seem to ask the man a question
the
chauffeur answer
title card
i work for miss miller now
george visibly do not know what to think and although he
remains pleasant become somewhat reserved
it be as though
something have come between they
the chauffeur place the
screenplay on the bedside table
george seem to greet it
with mistrust certainly not with enthusiasm
the chauffeur also have a box of cake with he that he put
on a plate for george
george do not want any it be all too
much
before he leaf the chauffeur overcome he habitual
reserve for the first time and say to george
title card
she be be good to you
she be always look out
for you
the chauffeur leaf without trying to convince george
**further/far as the other look on full of pride and doubt



from the window we see the chauffeur get into the car and
drive off
we recognize the car as be the one that belong
to george
at the window george watch he leave
then he seem
to have an idea or more exactly an intuition


george go into the room that be full of sheet
he go
straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lift up
the sheet
underneath he find he former objet art the
three monkey hear no evil speak no evil and see no
evil
he think for a moment then pull of another sheet to
reveal a piece of furniture
once again it be a piece that used
to belong to he and we recognize it from have see it at the
auction room
after taking off several other sheet george realize that
she buy everything he have put up for sale
furniture
painting objet art souvenir etc
he rip off sheet
one after the other and the object appear even down to his
suit and tuxedo
he continue and discover the paint
depict he in a tux waving and smile
george look
stun at the sight of himself looking so full of life
he be
interrupt by the same ray of light which surge into the room
once more
this time at the door be the butler and the maid
george walk towards they when he see they
the close he get
to they however the more he expression tighten
we realize
that the butler be none other than the distinguishedlooking
man who purchased everything at the auction and that the maid
be the woman who be bidding against he to raise the sale
price
george be looking at they as he leaf the room
he have
recognized they but do not say anything to they
he walk
off still shock by what he be just realized


he finish putting on he burn suit in he room and leave


he go down the stairs and flee the house



george be in the street wearing he burn suit and damage
shoe
he be shirtless
with jack by he side he walk along
the sidewalk
there be a few other people walking along
about
twenty yard ahead of he a man be begging
he hold out he
hand to passersby
george approach and when there be no
other passersby between he and george the beggar glance at
he and lower he hand
he do not raise it as george
approach
george stop in front of he and look at he but
the beggar motion to he to scram
george continue on his
way
for that moment at least he have become one of they
he button up the collar of he suit in an attempt to hide the
fact that he do not have a shirt then head off and lose
himself in the crowd
some distance later he stop to check
he reflection in a shop window
the image he see be that of a
bum
it be even more strike because the in the window there be
a young male mannequin wearing a tux top hat and white scarf
the image of the mannequin and that of george be superimposed
cop come up to george and begin talking to he in a
friendly manner
he speak but we do not know what about
there
be not title card
george visibly have no idea what the cop be
talking about
the cop seem to be talking about nothing
important just chatting
he talk and talk
george
do not understand what he be saying and do not understand
why he be talking to he
he be lost
title card
what do you say
the cop smile carry on talking then stop
he think
he be talking to a madman
he do not persist merely size
george up and once he be decided that he be harmless the cop
walk off
george totally bewilder by the incident seem
to lose he grip on himself a little more


peppy get home in the evening arm laden with flower
she be
happy
she quickly go up the stairs and into georges bedroom
he be
not there
she look for he but can not find he
the maid say
that he have left
she drop the flower


george go into he house that have be disfigured by the
fire
the flame have changed everything and the atmosphere
here again seem ghostly and sad

george sit down in an armchair in the darkness
jack sit down
facing he
he wag he tail and it thump on the ground


in the room with all the sheet peppy be with the maid
the
maid seem to be telling she what happen with george how he
remove all the sheet etc
peppy listen with an inscrutable
expression on she face
then suddenly overcome by a terrible
think she rush outside


she run out of the house and over to the car but the
chauffeur be not there
she honk the horn to call he but
there be no response
she honk the horn again then not
wanting to wait any long and seeing the key on the
dashboard she get behind the wheel start the engine and
pull off in a series of kangaroo hop
it be obvious that she
do not know how to drive all that well but still go at full
speed more or less successfully
just as she pass through
the gate the chauffeur turn up
too late
he see she drive
away


peppy be driving as fast as she can through town but she be
pretty reckless and almost cause an accident


outside georges house the wind be slamming one of the
shutter with the regularity of a metronome
george take a
gulp of liquor then put down the glass open a cardboard box
and take out a pistol that he place on the table in front of
he
he pick up the glass for another gulp
jack do not like
what he see
he bark
as for peppy she be speeding along totally ignore
even the most basic of road safety requirement
george put down he glass and pick up the pistol
jack be not happy at all

she jump out the car and run into the house


she rush into the live room and stop for a moment to look

he seem to reply that no it be not she fault she be get
