how we going to keep it

thank you


i get to ask you
why do you think
laz be keepin you chain like this

shrug at first
then

you know how like they say you
save someone life you responsible
for they
guess he just do not think
it be safe for i


so he get it into he head that the
only thing going to keep you from endin
up bleedin on the side of the road
again without a stitch of clthe
on be


yank on the
chain
you think he be crazy for thinkin
that

you a preacher


that be right

can i ask you a question


nod
people always say you get to get
good with jesus if you want not to
go to hell
that you say sorry for
all you do and
and jesus would
let you go on to heaven


you could put it that way

but that be so fuckin stupid
i be sorry
do not mean to curse


what be on you mind

you can not hurt people
and then
just say i be sorry and then
everything just get washed away
why would heaven want people like
that
people who
do what they
want and then
switch


i be going to tell you something and
it be just going to be between you and
i
i think folk carry on about heaven
too much
like it be some allyoucan
eat buffet up in the cloud
and
folk just going to do as they be tell
so they can eat what they want behind
some pearly gate
i can go to
Shoneys for that


there be sin in i heart
there be
evil in this world
but when i get
no one
i talk to god
i ask for
strength
i ask for forgiveness
not
for peace at the end of i day when
there be no more life to live and no
more good to do but today
right
now


what be you heaven
what give you
peace
