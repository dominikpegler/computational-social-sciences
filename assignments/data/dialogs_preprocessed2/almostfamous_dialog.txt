young hand come
into frame holding a pencil
for a few moment we hear only
the soft scratch of pencil on paper as credit be written
in a series of dissolve
the hand carefully erase and
correct an error or two along the way
and then the sound of
an old friend
the warm crackle of a vinyl record

we now hear the dialogue between this lively mother and she
son as she cook a pan full of soybased healthfood cutlet
the meal simmer unappetizingly in the pan
across the kitchen
we see william

roll believer speak as he strap on he guitar and get ready

root
but those root need to be
augment
i be going to tell you the truth
i may enrage some and enthrall other

you
manager here
example
if you have not run out on the contract in
phoenix you
have sue over
russells hand
but you left negate
the contract forfeit the deposit
and you effectively travel a long
way to pay that promoter
to
electrocute you
russell look at he hand

we can all work together
you damage
have put you way into the hole for
this tour
right now you owe the record
company more than you have get
but
you record selling there be money
to be make
so i have bring a plane
in we can add more show to makeup
the difference

we travel by bus

doris be the soul of this band

penny lane stand on stage facing the empty arena
the roady
have packed up and moved on
she be alone in the poetic and
trash filled structure that be just hour ago filled with
people




the band meet continue

it be not about the money
it be
about play music and turning people
on
the band agree

yes of course
clearly
but on the distasteful
subject of money
just know
you be
making it


he gesture to infinity

out
i be just talking about
bringing it
bring he hand together in a fist he return it close to
he heart

back
the band look at dick who manage not to be speechless

but why should we pay
for something
we can do ourselves
