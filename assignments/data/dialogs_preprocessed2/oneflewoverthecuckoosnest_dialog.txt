carny show to a top mechanic and
bull goose catskinner for every
gypo loggin operation in the
northwest till the army taught i
what i natural bent be

oh what be that

poker

i see

they say i be a habitual hassler
like i fight some
Sheeut
they
do not mind so much when i be a
dumb logger and get into a hassle
that be a hardworkin feller blowing
off steam they say
but if you be
a gambler all you have to do be
spit slantwise and you be a
goddamned criminal

i see

to tell the truth ever since i
find i natural callin i do
time in so many smalltime jail i
could write a brochure

yes
ah do you know why you be
here

well you know doc
do not it say so there

well accord to the warden at
pendleton you be a disturb
influence on other
it appear
that there be a potential in he
for instigate a revolt among the
other inmate

what do you think of that report

i do not doc

arrest on an assault charge five
time

that be correct doc

the doctor at the prison state
do not overlook the possibility
that this man may be fake
psychosis to escape the drudgery of
the work farm
what do you say
to that

doc what can i tell you

ah it seem you have no other
psychiatric history mister murphy

no this be i first trip doc

close folder and sit
back
well you be here for a ninetyday
observation period mister
McMurphy
i would like you to
understand you be here on a court
order and we be responsible to the
state
so i would like you
cooperation

you bet doc

good
good

i be tire
whew
lord
oh i be
awful tire

somebody please see to mister
Bancini so we can start the
meet

Ttttake it eeeasy
pete

awful tire

at the close of friday meet
we be discuss mister Hardings
problem concerning he wife
mister harding stated that he wife
make he uneasy because she draw
stare from man on the street
be
that correct mister harding

yes that be perfectly correct

he also think he may have given
she reason to seek sexual attention
elsewhere but he do not say how
he have be hear to say to his
wife i hate you i do not ever
want to see you again
you have
betrayed i

so
do anyone care to touch upon
this far

mister McMurphy this ward be a
democratic community run by the
patient and they vote so you
should feel at ease in you new
surroundings to the extent you can
freely discuss emotional problem
in front of the patient and staff
however the cardinal rule and i
must emphasize this
everyone keep
they seat during the meet

yeah well it just pain i
something awful to see a full
grow man slosh around in his
own water

yes
we be discuss mister
Hardings problem with he wife
now who will start
billy

Mmmmadam

would you like to start

Nnnnnno madam

mister Sefelt

mister fredrickson

mister Taber

mister martini

no

mister scanlon

mister Cheswick

be i to take it that there be not a
man among you who have an opinion
concerning this matter
no response
she focus
in on harding
mister harding you have stated on
more than one occasion that you
suspected you wife of seeing other
man

yes miss Ratched this be correct

but you have no proof

no miss Ratched

and yet you suspect she

yes that be correct

why

i can only speculate as to the
reason why

have you ever speculate mister
harding that you be impatient
with you wife because she do not
meet you mental requirement

miss Ratched
given all the
condition of that sublime
relationship coupled with the
subsequent annihilation of all that
i held to be sacred mentally
physically and emotionally the
only thing that i can speculate on
at this late date be how i will
justify the very existence of i
life with or without i dear wife

what be he talkin about

yeah harding why do not you
knockoff the bullshit and get to
the point

the point be i will carry on until
i fully understand what the
function of that relationship be
regardless of form or content

yes billy

dddo not sssee how
anyone could lulululove a man
who ttttalks the way he do

yeah harding you be so fuckin
dumb i can not believe it

that be a matter of opinion

yeah harding where do you breathe
anyway

through the ass

be that you sense of humor or be
you trying to say something

now what would i be trying to say

i do not know
i do not know but it
make i feel very peculiar when
you throw in something like that

peculiar

why

yeah why

yeah tell we why

i hesitate to go on

no secret mister harding
let we
get it all out in the open

i mean the other day you make an
allusion to i wife and the
possible sexual problem we might
be have
i know that to be the
case but the way in which you
broach it if that be you idea of
teaching i something

he voice rising as he
go on
or making i aware of a
condition in i life then i say
categorically speaking the hell
with you Taber
i do not have to justify the
condition of i life to you or any
of you
no matter what i will carry
on until i fully understand what
that function be regardless of the
form or content
regardless of the
fact we must try to understand the
function of we capacity to obtain
to personify the condition the
condition of we existence we
existence

you know what harding
i think
you be some kind of morbid asshole
or something
you have be talking
about you wife evere since i can
remember
you know she be on you
mind and blah blah blah and on
and on and when be you going to
wise up and turn she loose

music be so loud already it make
it difficult for the young fella
to hold a decent conversation

well i be turnin this dilemma
over in i head when i happen to
hit on that old tub room out there
an i said to myself McMurphy i
said that place would make a great
second day room
sort of game
room for the young fella
Whadaya
think doc

it be worth consider
miss
Ratched

the point be well taken doctor
but do we have the necessary
personnel to cover a second day
room

well since it will be largely the
Chronics who remain here one aide
and one nurse should easily be able
to handle any situation that might
occur
what do you think man be it
workable

right doc
it be workable

fine

good
good
yes yes i think we
should give it a trial period
so
may we get back to mister Hardings
problem
she see McMurphys hand
up
yes mister McMurphy

i be not finished yet

go on

kay item two

of the world series an what i want
be to take a vote on switchin the
group meetin to later on in the
day so we can watch the ballgame

just a minute mister McMurphy

be set up for a delicately
balance reason that would be
throw into turmoil by a switch of
routine

regardless of the function we will
confront the question of
yes
