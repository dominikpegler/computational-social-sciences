tight on a gloved hand as a lever be released
tight on the cable at the top of a rickety chair lift as
they kick into motion
wide as an empty chair swivel around and beneath the ass
of a threesome of
even wide to reveal a long line of skier and
awaiting they moment to step up to the chair
the camera find a group of three standing off to the side of
the line deck out in they winter gear
angle on college age shaggy hair holding a
snowboard and a helmet in one hand as he study the
situation
next to he stand an impatient
college age goggle on he head and a face full of fresh
stubble standing on ski

white noise of the motorize cable go away leaving they

marlboros
beat

i told you that


from this distance the mountain look like a giant night

light of converging white string
even in this darkness the menace cloud be visible over
the tree

the three sit in the freeze chair
lynch be really get
impatient

what do you think the bad way to
die would be


that be not morbid

yeah seriously
that be kinda
spooky dan


i think get eat by a shark
would be the bad way to go
not if it be like one of those

surfer where they get hit from
behind and they do not even know
what happen
you know
because it like come up

from beneath they
like on the jaw poster

the chick on the jaw poster be

hot

she be

i do not know
she be naked
naked chick be hot


but if you actually like see the
fin coming for you in the water
that would be bad than actually
get eat
knowing that this
animal be coming for you but you
can not get away
and that it be
going to eat you
like you be
going to get eat alive
have you
guy ever see that footage of the
great white jumping out of the
water to eat that seal

that be why i only swim in pool

i think burning to death would be
the bad


well yes and no
because most
people die of the smoke inhalation
before any fire even hit they

i remember watch for like

day straight after
that
footage that they keep showing of
all of those people leap off of
the top of the trade center
can
you imagine how bad it be inside

to know that jumping be a good
way out

but they say that when you jump

from that high up you heart stop
before you hit the ground and you
do not even feel it

then lynch
what be the bad

way to die

what

no you have an answer for

everything

almost instantly giant ball of hail stream down at they
ping off of the metal chair and pelt they face
the wind blow hard as they flimsy chair swing back and
forth in the foul weather

parker sob quietly into Dans shoulder

lynch pull the bar down and sulk looking away from dan
the hailsleet mixture keep pelt against they skin as
they sit together in silence
another loud thunder clap hit
this time much closer

the sleet begin to ice over the leave and vegetation below
ski track fill in with the wet rain


the entire mountain be covered in dark cloud


the three strand kid huddle together for warmth as the
hail pour down around they in sheet

suddenly a beam of light begin to shine up at they
Dans head snap up


snow cat slowly make it be way down the hill towards the

parker take off she helmet and throw it down


steve turn the headlight in the opposite direction just
missing the helmet falling past he windshield

bite get more frequent and he scream even more painful

the sound of several wolf attack in unison over power
he cry

lynch continue to hold he hand over parkers ear and keep
she eye pointed at his as the sound of Dans demise echo
through the night
the sound of clothes be shred flesh be torn and

bone pop from they joint create a chorus of pain
below
dan do not scream as much as do cry out in pain and agony

the camera never see it
only lynch and parkers face
after what seem to be an unbearable minute
the sound from
below begin to dissipate
eventually Dans remains can be hear drag away

silence once again
finally lynch let we go of parkers head
he sob into his
own freeze glove as parker hysterically scream out into the
night


parkers scream echo across the dark wilderness
somewhere

in the distance bird take off in fear

lynch and parker sit on the freeze chair shivering
they be now in the devastate silence that have fallen after
what must have be endless screaming and crying
only the
occasional sniffle let we we know that they be even awake
finally lynch break the silence

he head be lean to one side in a
position that be sure to give he the bad stiff neck he be

she snow pants turn dark around she bottom
slowly a puddle
of urine form on the chair between she and lynch
below they the urine fall into the snow and disappear
parkers eye swell as she begin to cry what be leave of she
tear
she be emotionally degraded and devastated

as she nose begin to run she instinctively wipe she hand
across it
taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of she
cheek with it
she do not even feel it


they both sleep

finally lynch stir and check parker to see if she be still

onto the ground
lynch be once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the
chair back as parker hold he steady






he hoist himself up onto the cable briefly but after just a
few second he return he foot to the chair back

towards Lynchs body
one step at a time


as the camera track away from the approaching wolf and
towards lynch
it be revealed that he be only winded
he feel he body for damage wince at what can only be a
break rib or two
he right arm be twisted at an odd angle
and by the look on Lynchs face it must be either break or

the leader shy away but growl hard




second wolf rush lynch from behind and grab he injure

the rest of the wolf quickly reveal themselves in the
bush and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill


parker look from lynch to the ground way below she





lynch try to fight off the wolf with he free arm
finally he be able to plunge the ski pole deep into the
wolf body

the wolf in pain and scamper away towards the safety
of the pack
the impending wolf stop they slow march and wait
this
food still have some fight left in it




he move as fast as he can towards the area under parkers
chair swinging he weapon like a madman all the while

without hesitation lynch throw down Dans board and lay

he body on top of it
push off he begin to slide
quickly down the hill


from parkers she watch he disappear down the hill
but mere second later the pack of wolf give chase and
follow suit behind he over the horizon
only the creaking of the strain metal chair arm can be

hear now
parker sob quietly to herself


from a distance parkers break chair dangle dangerously in
the night air
she body be slump in the corner
still


parker be not moving in she chair




the morning sun hit parkers pale face
be she dead
parker open she eye
she must have drift off for the
night
she look to the treeline around she

the sun be coming up
she try to move she body to look back in Lynchs direction
and the chair argue back at she with another loud groan and
cable noise


lynch
there be no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down
the hill behind she
slowly a look of great determination come over she face

she raise the safety bar
there be no more time to think

she be going to die one way or another
slowly parker turn she body around towards the seat of the
chair
holding on to the metal beam that make up the chair she
being to lower herself inch by inch off of the side

the lone metal bolt protest the movement and
make metallic threat to snap
parker keep lowering herself until she entire low body be
dangle below the chair

gust of wind push against the chair
strain the arm

unnatural angle
adrenaline overtake she pain as she lift the chair up and
remove she foot from beneath it

she look around for she snow board but with all of the
fresh snowfall it be buried and go
parker lay she body down flat on she jacket and begin to
push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can


parker come down the hill gain some speed on she awkward
coatsled

as she make she way she spot a tree
with bright red
blood splay out in the snow around it
cautiously she slow herself down


joe
from parkers the camera slowly reveal what be just
beyond the bloody tree
but the look on parkers face tell we everything we need to
know first
there in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree
be the pack of wolf
some still feed
other resting attentively
they be circled around Lynchs bloody halfeaten remain

quick shot of he jacket he boot and he gloved hand all
flash before parkers devastate eye

finally the leader turn away from parker back to he food
back to he family
though she face be emotionless parkers eye be swollen
with tear as she continue on she way down the mountain
side
she be free

parker continue down the treacherous trail as the snow fall
around she
occasionally she hit bump and turn that because she to spill
from she awkward coatsled
but she pull herself back on
and continue to make she way down the hill stoically

parker reach the bottom of the hill
grunt and crying from the pain she crawl over on she
belly and begin to drag herself towards the park lot

parker drag she devastate body into the street
just as she get there
