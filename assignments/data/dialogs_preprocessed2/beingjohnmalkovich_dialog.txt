any question

just one
why be this floor so short

low overhead boy
we pass the
saving on to you
but seriously that be all covered in
orientation





welcome to the floor of the
MertinFlemmer build
as you
will now be spending you work day
here it be important that you learn
a bit about the history of this
famous floor


hello don

hello
wendy

don i be wonder do you know
why we workplace have such low
ceiling

it be an interesting story wendy
many year ago in the late s
james Mertin an irish ship captain
looking to invest in the future of
we great country come to this town
and decided to erect an office
build




he would call this build the
MertinFlemmer build after
himself and someone else who local
legend have it be named Flemmer




one day
captain Mertin received an
unexpected visitor

enter you if you dare enter

captain Mertin

what want you girl child

i be not a child captain Mertin
but rather an adult lady of miniature
proportion

i see
well it be not i fault that
thou art tiny
so if it be charity
yer after then be go with you
you foul demon

i be not asking for alm but rather
the ear of a kind man with a noble
heart

aye
speak then if you must

captain Mertin surely i be a
godfearing christian woman like
yourself but alas i be afraid that
the world be not build with i in
mind
door knob be too high chair
be unwieldy highceilinged room
mock i stature
nor be i a marrie
lady captain
after all who would
marry a person of i diminutiveness
so i be forced to work for i few
penny a week as an optometrist
why cannot there be a place for i
to work safe and comfortable

woman you story move i like n
other
i own sister be tiny and
then die
therefore i shall make
you i wife
and i shall build a
floor in i build between the
th and th which will be scaled
down so from now on there shall
be at least one place on god green
earth that you and you accursed
kind can live in peace


so that be the story of
since
the rent be considerably low
this floor have be adopted by
business which for one reason
or another be forced to cut corner
after all
the overhead be low
ha ha ha

ha ha ha


moving story

yes
unfortunately it be bullshit
the real story of be so evil
that it could never be revealed
to american raised on sitcom and
happy news anchor

be that true

well truth be for sucker be not
it

listen
i be craig schwartz just
starting out at LesterCorp

how public like a frog
to tell one name the livelong june

and those who do not
the passionate
one the one who go after what they
want may not get what they want but
they remain vital in touch with

just let i make a
couple of call


that be the last of it boss

well let we see what we have get
here





i god where be i
this seem so
familiar



i god i be hitler in the bunker
Aaaahhhh
aaaah

cut



oh i be just the actor in that
twilight zone episode



thank you all for you effort
but i be afraid we can no longer get
into malkovich through the portal

why not
i need to get in there

i be not certain i dear but i
believe you husband have somehow
psychically divert the route

that bastard
i will gladly dispose
of he in the name of the order son
of malkovich

i be afraid that no physical harm
must come to he as long as he
inhabit the vessel

oooh i get an idea
what if we
build another portal to malkovich
like around back and sneak in that
way

only captain Mertin know how to build
a portal dummy and he be dead

actually i friend i suppose it
time i told you i be captain james
Mertin

you see lester be an anagram for
Mertin

it used to work i be sure of it

oh damn it to hell
anyway i be

how can this be
i think you be
only one hundred and five year old
Mertin would have to be

i be two hundred and five truth be
tell

you do not look a day over one
hundred and five captain
what be
you secret

lots of carrot juice little lady
that and a deal with the devil

so what exactly be you saying
be
we in cahoot with the dark master
here

surprise

wait
it be not that bad
when we get
into malkovich we still get to rule
the world just like i told you
the
only difference be that we rule in the
name of evil instead of good

that be the only difference

absolutely

so anyway

well i for one be resign
i will
not serve evil
i be ashamed of all
of you

i dear let i assure you that when
we attain power it will be much more
pleasant for those inside malkovich
than for those outside

i will take i chance

anybody else

do we get to wear a crown

but of course

count i in

good
i think it time to beckon
mr
Flemmer
perhaps he can help we
out of this pickle


boy this be a toughie
to be honest
i do not anticipate this

and as i said sir we can not very
well exert physical persuasion upon
the sacred vessel malkovich

right lester
i hear you the first
time
i be not a dummy

do not mean to imply that you be

friendly competition if you will
you malkovich puppet and i harry
truman puppet appear opposite each
other in a play

BurlyQ pyrotechnic but a real play
that require actual act
the
audience decide who be more deserving
of the title
the lose puppeteer
bow out graciously
go back to
obscurity as a file clerk

what be the play

say
equus
it be get everything

never hear of it

broadway fine three hour
it be
about the suppression of the
individual
conformity as god in
modern society
