at school george

thanks


now we come to the real purpose of
this meet to appoint a successor
to we dear friend peter bailey

mr
chairman i would like to get to i
real purpose

wait just a minute now

wait for what
i claim this
institution be not necessary to this
town
therefore mr
chairman i
make a motion to dissolve this
institution and turn it asset and
liability over to the receiver

george you hear what that buzzard

mr
chairman it be too soon after
peter baileys death to discuss
chloroforming the build and loan

peter bailey die three month ago
i second mr
potters motion


very well
in that case i will ask the
two executive officer to withdraw


but before you go i be sure the whole
board wish to express it deep
sorrow at the pass of peter bailey

thank you very much


it be he faith and devotion that
be responsible for this organization

i will go far than that
i will say
that to the public peter bailey be
the build and loan

trying to control
himself
oh that be fine potter coming from
you consider that you probably
drive he to he grave

peter bailey be not a business man
that be what killed he
oh i do not
mean any disrespect to he god rest
he soul
he be a man of high
ideal socalled but ideal without
common sense can ruin this town
picking up paper
from table
now you take this loan here to ernie
bishop
you know that fellow that
sit around all day on he brain in
he taxi
you know
i happen to
know the bank turned down this loan
but he come here and we be building
he a house worth five thousand
dollar
why

well i handle that mr
potter
you have all the paper there
he
salary insurance
i can personally
vouch for he character

friend of yours

yes sir

you see if you shoot pool with some
employee here you can come and borrow
money
what do that get we

discontented lazy rabble instead of
a thrifty work class
and all
because a few starryeyed dreamer
like peter bailey stir they up and
fill they head with a lot of
impossible idea
now i say

just a minute just a minute
now
hold on mr
potter
you be right
when you say i father be no business
man
i know that
why he ever start
this cheap pennyante build and
loan i will never know
but neither
you nor anybody else can say anything
against he character because he
whole life be
why in the twenty
five year since he and uncle billy
start this thing he never once
thought of himself
be not that right
uncle billy
he do not save enough
money to send harry to school let
alone i
but he do help a few people
get out of you slum mr
potter
and what be wrong with that
why
here you be all businessman here
do not it make they good citizen
do not it make they good customer
you
you said
Whatd you say
just a minute ago
they have to
wait and save they money before
they even ought to think of a decent
home
wait
wait for what
until
they child grow up and leave
they
until they be so old and break
down that they
do you know how
long it take a work man to save
five thousand dollar
just remember
this mr
potter that this rabble
you be talking about
they do most
of the work and paying and living
and dying in this community
well
be it too much to have they work and
pay and live and die in a couple of
decent room and a bath
anyway i
father do not think so
people be
human being to he but to you a
warp frustrated old man they be
cattle
well in i book he die a
much rich man than you will ever be

george now that be just what i like
so much about you
pleasantly and
smoothly
george i be an old man and most
people hate i
but i do not like
they either so that make it all
even
you know just as well as i do
that i run practically everything in
this town but the bailey build
and loan
you know also that for a
number of year i have be trying to
get control of it
or kill it
but
i have not be able to do it
you
have be stopping i
in fact you
have beaten i george and as anyone
in this county can tell you that
take some do
take during the

Fortyfive
out of which
after support you mother and
paying you bill you be able to
keep say ten if you skimp
child
or two come along and you will not
even be able to save the ten
now
if this young man of twentyeight
be a common ordinary yokel i would
say he be do fine
but george
bailey be not a common ordinary
yokel
he be an intelligent smart
ambitious young man who hate he
job who hate the build and
loan almost as much as i do
young
man who be be die to get out on

crowd mind you a young man who have
to sit by and watch he friend go
place because he be trapped
