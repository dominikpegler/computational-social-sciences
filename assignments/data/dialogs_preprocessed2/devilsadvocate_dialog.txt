it be certainly not a religious
practice perform by everyone
it be not as common as say
circumcision
it be certainly not
as common as the belief that wine
be transformed into blood
it be
not even as common as the handle
of poisonous snake to prove one
faith
but phillipe Moyez be not
two thousand mile away in a
stockyard
he do not use
electricity to kill
and bad of
all

alexander cullen be guilty of
murdering three people in cold
blood with malice aforethought

mr
lomax
we can break for lunch now or you
can do a stop and start

if it be a choice i will go now
i
will not be as long as mr
Broygo

proceed

we just spent we morning listen
to mr
Broygo talk about his
evidence
what he neglect to
tell you be what this case be
really about
he left out the most
important fact of all
alex cullen
be somewhere else when these
murder take place
now alex
cullen have do a lot of thing i
do not like
he be be a terrible
husband to all three of he wife
he be be a destructive force in
the live of he stepchildren
he be cheated the city
he partner
he employee
he be paid hundreds of
thousands of dollar in penalty and
fine over the year
i do not like
those thing
i do not expect you to
like they
there will be other thing
during the course of this trial that
you will hear about and like even
less
but this be not a popularity
contest
it be a murder trial and
alex cullen have not killed anybody



the state be going all out here
they have get a whole team over
there
they be throwing
everything but the kitchen sink
at this case
i need one thing
from you
that be it
one thing
i need you to ask yourself be
not liking this man reason
enough to convict he of
murder

enjoy you lunch
we will talk
again




what the fuck be that
be you
out of you fuck mind
they fucking hate i

i be
going to bust i ass to make sure
they hate you
because as long as
you be out bon melissa you be
not home killing you wife

pause as he warm
to the idea
why do not you tell i before

then it do not look spontaneous




let i put it this way then
can
you tell from a blood sample if
the person be alive or dead

the victim
of course not

and there be a two hour window in
which to place these murder

yes

so you have get absolutely no way
to determine the condition of the
victim when alexander cullen put
he hand on that wall
