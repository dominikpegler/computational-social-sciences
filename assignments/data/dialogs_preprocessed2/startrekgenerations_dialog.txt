march





there he be there to the
south

what be you blind
that be a
bird





repel the crystalline
trench
raft down lava
flow
orbital skydiving
it be
like the man be running a bloody
decathlon across the galaxy

re
sound
that should be he now
i think
he be just cross the sound
barrier





right on target
i jump out over
the arabian peninsula
and i end
up here right on the dime

actually captain you precise
target area be thirtyfive
meter
that way

thanks for pointing that out

oh

i have warn you about that back of
yours
you should have a doctor
take a look at it





tomorrow i want to make a tri
elliptical jump
that be where you
jump out over northern china and
make three complete orbit before
you start reentry

captain
perhaps you have
forgotten that tomorrow be the
christening ceremony

i be not going
scotty help i with this chute

what do you mean you be not
going
we promised

when i retired i swear i would never
set foot on a starship again and
i mean it

captain

i do not want to hear anymore about
it
i be not going and that be
final












captain kirk how do it feel
to be back on the enterprise
bridge
captain can i have a
minute
captain scott do you
have any comment on
commander
chekov
etc

excuse i excuse i
there will
be plenty of time for question
later

i be captain john harriman
i would
like to welcome you all aboard

it be we pleasure

i just want you to know how
excited we all be to have a group
of living legend with we on we
maiden voyage
i remember reading about you
mission when i be in grade
school

well
may we have a look around

please
please

Demora

so captain
this be the first
starship enterprise in thirty
year without james
kirk in
command
how do you feel about
that

just fine
i be glad to be here to
send she on she way

what have you be do since you
retire

i have be
keeping busy

excuse i captain
i would like you
to meet the helmsman of the
EnterpriseB
ensign Demora sulu
captain james kirk

it be a pleasure to meet you sir
i father told i some
interesting story about you

you father
hikaru sulu be you
father

yes sir

you meet she once before but she
be

but that be not so long ago
it
could not have be more than

twelve year sir

yes
well
congratulations
ensign
it would not be the
enterprise without a sulu at the
helm

thank you sir
let i show you the new inertial
guidance system

damn fine ship if you ask i

you know scotty
it amaze i

and what would that be sir

sulu
when do he find the time
for a family

it be like you always said if
something important enough you
make the time

so
that be why you have be
running around the galaxy like an
eighteenyearold
finding
retirement a little lonely be we

with that kind of tact i be glad
you be an engineer and not a
psychiatrist

excuse i gentleman
if you will
take you seat

oh
of course


prepare to leave spacedock
aft
thruster ahead one quarter port
and starboard at station keep
captain kirk i would be honore if
you would give the order to get
underway

no
no
thank you

please i insist

take we out

very good sir

bring a tear to i eye






well
we have just clear the
asteroid belt
we course will
take we out beyond pluto and then
back to spacedock
just a quick
run around the block
if we have time we will conduct a
few test of the warp

we be picking up a distress call
captain

on speaker

this be the transport ship Lakul
we be catch in some kind of
energy distortion
we can not break
free
need immediate help
it tearing we

the Lakul be one of two ship
transport ElAurian refugee to
earth

can you locate they

the ship be bearing at three one
zero mark two one five
distance
three light year

signal the close starship
we be in no condition to mount a
rescue
we do not even have a
full crew aboard

we be the only one in range sir

well then
i guess it be up to
we
helm lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp

be there something wrong with you
chair captain





we be within visual range of the
energy distortion captain

on screen


what the hell be that

i have find the transport ship


they hull be starting to buckle
under the stress they will not
survive much longer

we be encounter severe
gravimetric distortion from the
energy ribbon

we will have to keep we distance
we do not want to get pull in
too

tractor beam

we do not have a tractor beam

you left spacedock without a
tractor beam

it will not be install until
tuesday
ensign sulu
try generating a
subspace field around the ship
that might break they free

aye sir

continue
shake she
head
there be too much quantum
interference captain

what about
venting plasma from
the warp nacelle
that might
disrupt the ribbon hold on the
ship

aye sir
release drive
plasma

it be not have any effect sir
i think

sir
the starboard vessel hull
be collapse


how many people be aboard
that ship

two hundred sixtyfive

the Lakuls hull integrity be down
to twelve percent sir

captain kirk
i would appreciate
any
suggestion you might have

first move we within
transporter range and beam those
people to the enterprise

what about the gravimetric
distortion
they will tear we
apart

risk be part of the game if you
want to sit in that chair

helm close to within transporter
range

and second turn that damned
thing off






we be within range sir

beam they directly to Sickbay

how bigas you medical staff

the medical staff
do not
arrive until tuesday

you and you
you have just become
nurse
let we go

main engineering report
fluctuation in the warp plasma
relay

bypass the relay and go to
auxiliary system

sir i be have trouble locking
onto they
they appear to be
in some sort of
temporal flux

scotty

what the hell

they life sign be
be
phase in and out of we
spacetime continuum

phasing
to where

sir
they hullos collapsing





i get fortyseven of they
out of one hundred fifty

report

we be catch in a gravimetric
field emanate from the trail
edge of the ribbon

all engine full reverse





the color be touching i
i be
catch in the glass
help i
i can see the second
over
here
etc

it will be all right
we be going
to take care of you

only minor injury so far
but it look like they be all
suffering from some kind of
neural shock

why
why

it be all right
you be safe
you be on the enterprise

no
i have to go
i have to
get back
you do not understand
let i go

what be he talking about

easy there

it be going to be okay
here just
lie down



inertial damper failing

engine not respond

i do not expect to die i first
day on the job

the first thing you learn as
captain be how to cheat death
scotty

there be just no way to disrupt a
gravimetric field of this
magnitude

hull integrity failing

but i do have a theory

i think you might

an antimatter discharge directly
ahead
it might disrupt the
field long enough for we to break
away

photon torpedo

aye

load torpedo bay prepare to fire
on i command

captain
we do not have any
torpedoe

do not tell i
tuesday

captain it may be possible to
simulate a torpedo blast use a
resonance burst from the main
deflector dish

where be the deflector relay

deck fifteen section twentyone
alpha

i will go
you have the bridge

no
a captain place be on the
bridge of he ship
i will take care of it

keep she together until i get
back

i always do








Fortyfive second to structural
collapse

bridge to captain kirk



kirk here

captain i do not know how much
longer i can hold she together

that be it
go



activate main deflector





we be breaking free






we be clear

you do it kirk
damage report ensign

there be some buckle on the
starboard nacelle
we have also get a hull breach in
the engineering section
emergency forcefields be in place
and holding

where

section twenty through twenty
eight on deck thirteen
fourteen
look at scotty with
meaning
and fifteen

bridge to captain kirk
captain kirk please respond

have chekov meet i on deck
fifteen





i god
be anyone in there

aye





i have check the entire ship and
the surround space
there be
no sign of he

just a quick
run around the
block

i never think it would end like
this

all thing must end mr
chekov

let we go home








bring out the prisoner


mister Worf
i always know this
day would come
be you prepare
to face the charge

answer he

i be prepare

we the officer and crew of the
you


enterprise be of sound
mind and judgment hereby make
the follow charge against
lieutenant Worf
one
that he do
knowingly and willfully perform
above and beyond the call of duty
on countless occasion
two
that he have be a good and solid
officer on this ship for one score
less twelve year
and three
most seriously
that he have
earned the respect and admiration
of the entire crew


there can be only one punishment
for such crime
i hereby promote you to the rank
of lieutenant commander with all
the right and privilege thereto
and may god have mercy on you
soul

congratulations commander

thank you sir

extend the plank

into the sea with he
feed he
to the shark
walk the
plank
etc

do not you think you be taking this
a little too far number one

when we go to ancient rome for
Deannas promotion we threw she
to the lion remember



i can not swim

the Holodeck safety program be
engaged
the computer will not let
you drown

but the shark be quite
convince

doctor i must confess i be
uncertain as to why pushing
someone into freeze shark
infest water be amuse

it be all do in good fun data
get in the spirit of thing

ah

data
data

data
that be not funny


well now that we be all aboard
number one bring the ship before
the wind
let we see what be out there

aye aye sir
take the wheel commander

all hand make sail
raise up
tack and stand by the brace





imagine what it be like will
no
engine
no computer
just
the wind the sea and the star to
guide you

bad food brutal discipline
no woman

bridge to captain picard

picard here

there be a personal message for
you from earth

put it through down here
but the good thing about a life at
sea be that they could not get to
you

computer arch




here
take the wheel


captain be you all right

yes
fine
if you will excuse
i

computer exit



set the royal and the stud
sail mister Worf

the royal
stud

you see the top yardarm now look
to the

bridge to commander Riker

Riker here

we be picking up a distress call
from the Amargosa observatory
sir
they say they be under
attack

red alert
all hand to
battle station
captain picard to
the bridge






it look like we be too late

there be no other ship in the
system

sensor show five life sign
aboard the station captain

the station complement be
nineteen

secure from red alert
number
one begin an investigation
i will
be in i ready room

sir

make it so




these blast pattern be
consistent with typethree
disruptors

well that narrow it to klingon
breen or romulan

i be picking up life sign
about
twenty meter ahead

that rule out klingon

they would not have left anyone
alive

over here

Worf you be with i
Paskall
you and mendez search the upper
deck

under here

it be all right
do not struggle

i be commander william Riker of the
starship enterprise

Soran
doctor Tolian Soran

who attacked you doctor

i be not sure
it happen so
fast

commander you would well take a
look at this


romulan




be she still angry

no
but i would stay out of Sickbay
for a while if i be you
i
still do not know why you drop
she in the water

i be attempting to
get in the
spirit of thing
i think it
would be humorous

data
you be not think about
use that thing be you

it have occur to i on several
occasion
but i believe this may
be the appropriate time

wait a minute
i think you have
always be afraid it would
overload you neural net

that be true
however i believe
i growth as an artificial
life form have reach an impasse
for thirtyfour year i have
endeavore to become more human
to grow beyond i original
program
and yet i be still
unable to grasp such a simple
concept as humor
re
chip
this emotion chip be the only
answer

all right

but at the first sign of trouble
i be going to deactivate it
agreed

agreed




we find two dead romulan aboard
the station
we be analyze
they equipment to see if we can
determine what ship they come
from

there be still no indication of why
they attacked the station

we think they be looking for
something they practically tear
the place apart

hmm
inform starfleet command
this
could indicate a new romulan
threat in this sector

you want i to contact starfleet

be there a problem

no sir

thank you number one

there be something else captain
one of the scientist
a doctor
Soran
have insist on speaking
with you
i told he you be busy sir but
he said it be absolutely
imperative that he speak with you
right away

understand
that will be all

sir
be there anything wrong

no
thank you




you two just volunteer to be i
first victim
re
liquid
this be a new concoction i
picked up on Forcas three
trust i
you be going to love it

well

i believe the beverage have
provoke an emotional response

really
what do you feel

i be uncertain
i have have little
experience with emotion
i be
unable to articulate the
sensation

emotion

i will explain later

i do not think he like it

yes
that be it
i hate it

data i think the chip be
work

yes
i hate this
it be
revolting

another round

please


doctor Soran

yes yes captain thank you for
coming

nothing for i
i understand there be something
urgent you need to discuss with
i

yes
i need to return to the
observatory immediately
i must
continue a critical experiment i
be running on the Amargosa star

doctor
we be still conducting
an investigation into the attack
once we have completed we work
we will be happy to allow you and
you fellow scientist back aboard
the observatory
until then

the time be very important on i
experiment if it be not
completed within the next twelve
hour year of research will be
lost

we be do the good we can
now
if you will excuse i

they say time be the fire in
which we burn
and right now
captain i time be running out
we leave so many thing unfinished
in we live i be sure you can
understand

i will see what i can do







one of the dead romulan have a
tricorder
we analyze it sensor
log and find they be scanning
for signature particle of a
compound called trilithium

Trilithium

an experimental compound the
romulan have be working on
in
theory a trilithiumbased
explosive would be thousands of
time more powerful than an
antimatter weapon
but they never
find a way to stabilize it

why be they looking for it on a
federation observatory
it do not
make any sense

have Geordi and data go over with
the next away team
tell they to
scan the observatory for
trilithium

aye sir




there be no sign of any trilithium
in here

i get it
i get it

you get what

when you said to commander
Riker
the clown can stay but the
Ferengi in the gorilla suit have to
go


what

during the Farpoint mission
we
be on the bridge and you told a
joke
that be the punch line

the Farpoint mission
data that
be seven year ago

i know
i just get it
it be very funny

thanks



wait a minute
there be a hide
doorway here
i can see the
joint of the metal with i

there appear to be a dampen
field in operation
i cannot scan
beyond the bulkhead

i do not see a control panel
or
an access port

it appear to be a magnetically
seal

i believe i can reverse the
polarity by attenuate i axial
servo

open sesame


you could say i have a
magnetic
personality



i be still not picking up anything
someone go to a lot of trouble
to shield this room

data take a look at this
you ever see a solar probe with
this kind of configuration

no Geordi
i have not
it be
most unusual

just help i get this panel open

whoa
i picking up
something in the theta band
it
could be a trilithium signature

data this be not the time

i be sorry
but i cannot stop
myself
i think something be
wrong


data

data be you all right

i believe the emotional chip have
overloaded i positronic relay

we well get you back to the
ship
la forge to enterprise

be there a problem gentleman


oh
doctor
yeah as a matter
of fact there be
there be a
damp field in here block
we com signal
re
data
will you give i a hand

i would be happy to

please do not hurt i




tea
earl grey
hot

come

Counselor
what can i do for you

actually
i be here to see if
there be anything i can do for you

well
i appreciate you concern
but i would rather not discuss it
right now thank you

i be afraid i can not just leave it
at that
the command officer
of this ship be clearly distraught
about something
as ship
Counselor it be i duty to

as ship counselor it be you
duty to know not only when you be
needed
but also when you be
not

you can not fool an empath captain
i know exactly when i be needed

well with all due respect to you
Betazoid sense i prefer to be
alone right now

very well
i suppose i could make
out i weekly report to starfleet
command without you input
admiral Lusby
regarding the
unusual behavior of JeanLuc
picard
i find he increasingly
irritable
remote
and
uncooperative
i recommend forced
shore leave at a Starbase facility
in order to

all right all right
you have make
you point

the message i received
i brother
and he son i
nephew burned to death in a
fire

captain i be sorry
i know there be a lot of
unresolved conflict between you
and you brother

what i can not get out of i mind be
the image of rene i nephew
i just can not believe he be go

it be only natural to feel a
heighten sense of tragedy when
a child die
but it go deep than that
do not it
i can sense that rene
mean a great deal to you

in a way he be as close as i
ever come to have a child of i
own

you family history be very
important to you be not it

ever since i be a little boy i
remember hearing about the family
line
the Picards that fight at
trafalgar
the Picards that
settled the first martian colony
when i brother married and have a
son

you feel it be no longer you
responsibility to carry on the
family line

i brother have shoulder that
burden
allow i to pursue i
own selfish need

there be nothing selfish about
pursue you own life
you own
career

you know Counselor
i be not
get any young
for some
time now i have be aware that
there be fewer day ahead than
there be behind
but i always take comfort in the
fact that when i be go i
family would continue
but now

i have have brush with death
more than i care to contemplate
i always accepted it as a
calculate risk that go along
with wearing this uniform
but now
the idea of death have
a terrible sense of finality to
it

i be the last picard

captain perhaps we

red alert
all hand to duty
station







report

quantum implosion have occur
within the Amargosa star
all
nuclear fusion be breaking down

how be that possible

sensor record show a solar probe
be launch from the observatory
a few moment ago

the stare going to collapse in a
matter of minute

sir the implosion have produced
a level twelve shock wave

level twelve
Thatll destroy
everything in this system

transporter room to bridge
i
can not locate commander la forge or
mister data sir

do they return to the ship

no sir
they be not aboard

how long until the shock wave hit
the observatory

four minute forty second

mister Worf





what the hello he do

enterprise to commander Riker you
have two minute left

Soran do you hear that
there be
a level twelve shock wave coming
we have get to get out of here




sir
klingon bird of prey be
decloaking off the port bow

what







data
see if you can get to
Geordi

i
cannot sir
i believe i
am
afraid





transporter room to bridge
i
have the away team aboard sir

helm warp one engage






Tohpakcha
glorious


HoS qorDu
great power


you have do it Soran

wait

i hope for you sake that you be
initiate a mate ritual

you get careless
the romulan
come looking for they miss
trilithium

impossible
we left no survivor
on they outpost

they know it be aboard the
observatory
if the enterprise
have not intervene they would have
find it

but they do not find it
and now
we have a weapon of unlimited
power

i have the weapon Lursa
and if
you ever want i to give it to
you i advise you to be a little
more careful in the future

perhaps we be tire of waiting

without i research
the
trilithium be worthless
as be
you plan to reconquer the
klingon empire

set course for the Veridian
system
maximum warp

BoshtaJaH Veridian

what shall i do with this

bring he with i
i need some
answer from mr
la forge





i have spoken to the klingon high
council sir
they identify the
bird of prey as belonging to the
duras sister

Lursa and BEtor
this do not
make any sense
renowned
stellar physicist somehow use a
trilithium probe to destroy a
star kidnap Geordi
and
escape with a pair of klingon
renegade
why
what the hello
going on



how be he

it look like a power surge fuse
the emotional chip into he neural
net

will that be a danger to he

i do not think so
the chip still
seem to be work
i would feel
well if i could take a close
look but i can not remove it
without completely dismantling he
cerebral conduit

look like you be stick with
emotion for a while
how do you
feel

i be quite
preoccupy with
concern about Geordi

we all be data
but we be going
to get he back

i hope so sir

wil i checked into doctor Sorans
background

he be an ElAurian
over three
hundred year old
he lost his
entire family when the borg
destroyed he world
Soran
escaped with a handful of other
refugee aboard a ship called the
Lakul
the ship be destroyed by
some kind of energy ribbon but
Soran and fortysix other be
rescue by the EnterpriseB

that be the mission where james
kirk be killed

i checked the passenger manifest
of the Lakul
guess who else be
on board




Soran
that be a name i have not
hear in a long time

do you remember he

oh yes
i remember everyone who
be on the Lakul
every face
even the one who do not make
it

Guinan
it be important that you
tell i what you know
we think
Sorans developed a weapon
a
terrible weapon
it might give
he enough power to

Soran do not care about power or
weapon
all he care about be
get back to the nexus

what be the nexus

it be a place i have tried very hard
to forget

that ribbon be not just some random
energy phenomenon travel
through space
it be a doorway
it lead to another place
the
nexus
it do not exist in we
universe
and it do not play by
the same rule either

what happen to you

i can not remember very much
what
it look like or how long i be
there
but i do remember how it
feel

it be like be inside
joy
as if joy be a real thing that i
could wrap around myself
i have
never be so content

but then you be beamed away

i be pull away
i do not want
to leave
none of we do
i feel
like i would left a part of myself
behind
all i could think about
be get back
i do not care
what i have to do

it take a long time but
eventually i learned to live with
it
and i begin to realize that
i experience in the nexus have
changed i
i know thing about people
about event
about time

you sixth sense
i have always
wonder where it come from
and what about Soran

Soran may still be obsess with
get back
and if he be he will
do anything to find that doorway
again

but why destroy a star
thank you Guinan

let someone else do it JeanLuc

let they send another starship
do not get near the ribbon
if you
go into that nexus you be not
going to care about Soran or the
enterprise or i
all you be
going to care about be how it
feel to be there
and you be never going to come
back




re

remarkable piece of equipment
but a little inelegant would not
you say
have you ever considered a
prosthesis that would make you
look a little more
normal

what be normal

normal be what everyone else be
and what you be not

what do you want

as you may or may not be aware i
be an ElAurian
some people call
we a race of listener
we
listen
right now mr
la forge you
have i undivided attention
i
want to listen to everything you
know about trilithium
and i

Trilithium be an experimental
compound developed by the
romulan
i think it be a
derivative of

i do not want a science lecture
you be on that observatory
looking for trilithium
why

i be ordered to by the captain

let we try to move beyond the usual
prisonerinterrogator banter
shall we
you have information
and i need it
do the captain explain he order
to you
do he say why you be
searching for trilithium

no

what about
Guinan
what have
she told you about i

Guinan
i do not know what you be
talking about

i instinct tell i you be lying
and i know that can not be easy for
you
i can see you have a good heart

oh
i forget to tell you
while
you be unconscious i inject
a nanoprobe into you
bloodstream
it be be navigate
you cardiovascular system
and
right now i have attached it to you
leave ventricle
little trick i picked up
from the borg

yeah
they be full of great
idea

i just stopped you heart for five
second
it feel like an
eternity do not it
do you know
that you can stop the human heart
for up to ten minute before the
onset of brain damage

no
i do not know that

we learn something new about
ourselves every day
now
maybe i do not make myself
clear
it be very important that
you tell i exactly what captain
picard know

i told you everything
you might
as well just kill i right now

i be not a killer mr
la forge
let we try thirty second




accord to we information the
ribbon be a conflux of temporal
energy which travel through we
galaxy every thirtynine point one
year

when be it expected back

data

sorry captain
the ribbon have
already entered the galaxy
it
will pass through this sector in
approximately thirtyone hour

Guinan said Soran be trying to
get back to the ribbon
if
that be true then there must be
some connection with the Amargosa
star

the stare destruction have have
numerous astrophysical effect
within this sector
however none
of they appear to have a
connection to the energy ribbon

give i a list of those effect
i want to know every single thing
which have be altered or
changed
no matter how
insignificant

it will take a few moment for the
computer to compile the
information

data be you all right

no sir
i be finding it
difficult to concentrate
i
believe i be overwhelmed with
feeling of
remorse and regret
concerning i action on the
observatory

what do you mean

i wanted to save Geordi
i
tried
but i experienced
something i do not expect
i believe it be fear

fear be a very difficult emotion
to overcome
it be something we
all have to learn to deal with

but i do not deal with it sir
i let it prevent i from helping
i friend
do that make i a coward

no
and what you must try to
avoid be becoming consume by
another emotion which i believe
you be beginning to experience
guilt

guilt
it be a most unpleasant
feel


accord to we current
information the destruction of
the Amargosa star have have the
follow effect in this sector
gamma emission have increased by
five percent
the starship
Bozeman be forced to make a
course correction
a research
project on Gorik four be
halt due to increase neutrino
particle
ambient magnetic
field have decrease by

wait
the Bozeman
why do it
change course

the destruction of the Amargosa
star have altered the gravitational
force throughout the sector
any
ship passing through this region
will have to make a minor course
correction

minor course correction
where be the ribbon now


this be it current position

can you project it course

data
i have nothing but sympathy
for what you be going through
but right now i need you full
attention on the task at hand
if you can not provide it
then i will
have to relieve you of duty until
doctor crusher can remove this
emotion chip of yours
i be sorry
but you leave i no other choice

i do not wish to remove the chip
sir
although these emotion be
proving difficult to deal with
i cannot imagine going back to a
life without they
i have taken
an important step toward becoming
truly human
if i be to turn
back now
i would like to continue in i
duty sir

courage be an emotion too data
now
can you project the course
of the ribbon

i believe so


enhance grid Anine

where be the Amargosa star

now
you said the gravitational
force in this sector have be
altered
could that also affect
the course of the ribbon

i believe so


that be what Sorans do
he be
changing it course
but why
why try to alter it
path
why not simply fly into it
with a ship

we record show that every ship
which have approach the ribbon
have either be destroyed or
severely damaged

he can not go to the ribbon
so
he be trying to make the ribbon
come to he
data be it going to pass near any
MClass planet

yes sir
there be two in the
Veridian system


it be very close to Veridian
three
but not close enough

data what would happen to the
ribbon path if he destroyed the
Veridian star itself


that be where he be going

it should be noted sir that the
collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave similar
to the one we observe at
Amargosa

and destroy every planet in the
system

be any of they inhabit

Veridian three be uninhabited
but Veridian four support a pre
industrial humanoid society

population

approximately two hundred thirty
million

picard to bridge

Worf here sir

red alert mister Worf
set a
course for the Veridian system
maximum warp






do you get anything from the
human

no
he heart just be not in it

we have enter orbit of Veridian
three

prepare to transport i to the
surface

wait
when do we get we payment

this contain all the information
you will need to build a trilithium
weapon
it be be coded
once
i be safely to the surface i will
transmit the decryption sequence
to you
not before

mistress
a federation starship
be enter the system

what
on viewer


they be hail we

cha on speaker


klingon vessel
we know what
you be do and we will destroy
any probe launch toward the
Veridian star

what do we do

there be no time for this
eliminate they

that be a galaxy class starship
we be no match for they

i think it be time we give mister
la forge he sight back






maybe they be not out there

they be just trying to decide
whether a twenty yearold klingon
bird of prey be any match for the
federation flagship

or perhaps they be on the
surface

mister data scan the planet for
life form

i be hope you would ask i to
do that captain
i just love to
scan for life form

life form
tiny little
life form
where be the
life form

commander

sorry sir
there be too much interference in
the planet ionosphere for an
accurate read

sir accord to i calculation
a solar probe launch from either
the klingon ship or the planet
surface will take eleven second
to reach the star
however since we do not know the
exact point of origin it will
take we between eight and fifteen
second to lock we weapon onto
it

that be a pretty big margin of
error

too big
how long until the
ribbon arrive

approximately fortyseven minute
sir

i have to find a way to get to
Soran

captain klingon vessel decloaking
directly ahead


they be hail

on screen


captain
what an unexpected
pleasure

Lursa i want to talk to Soran

i be afraid the doctor be no longer
aboard we ship

then i will beam down to his
location
just give we he
coordinate

the doctor value he privacy
he
would be quite
upset if an
away team interrupted he

very well
i will beam to you
ship and you can transport i to
Soran

sir you can not trust they
they will kill you just like they
kill Geordi

we do not kill you engineer
he be be
we guest

then return he

in exchange for what

i
if you let i speak to
Soran

the captain would make a much more
valuable hostage

we will consider it a prisoner
exchange

agreed

number one you have the bridge
have doctor crusher meet i in
transporter room three




receive the coordinate captain

energize




you must think i be quite the
madman

the thought have cross i mind

the only possible reason you be
here be because you be not
entirely confident you can shoot
down i probe after all
so
you have come to dissuade i from
i horrific plan
good luck





i have established the link

put it through over here

it be work

where be he

do not worry there be be no
permanent damage
you heart be
perfectly fine
there be be a
little arterial damage

human female be so repulsive




and some myocardial
degeneration
i be going to give
you some hematozine and i want to
run more test
but i think
you be going to be fine

thanks doc




you do not need to do this
Soran
i be sure we could find
another way to get you into this
nexus


i have spent eighty year looking
for another way captain
this be
the only one
of course you could always come
with i
you fancy yourself an
explorer
here a chance to
explore something no human have
ever experienced

not if it mean killing over two
hundred million people
beat then with
meaning
i wonder
do you wife leandra
know that she married a man who
be capable of mass murder

continue
pressing on
when you tuck you child into
bed
do you suppose they ever
suspected that they father would
one day kill millions as casually
as he kiss they goodnight

nice try






i think he be the chief
engineer

he be

then when be he going to
engineering




what you be about to do be no
different from when the borg
destroyed you world

you be right
and there be a
time when i would not have hurt
anyone
then the borg come
and
they show i that if there be
one constant in this universe
it be death
afterwards i begin to realize
that none of it matter
we be
all going to die anyway
it be
only a question of how and when
you will too captain
you might
contract a fatal disease
you
might die in battle

or burn to death in a fire

you look surprise
but you
should not be
i have be to the
nexus captain
i know thing
about people
be not you beginning to feel time
gain on you
it be like a
predator
it be stalking you
you
can try to outrun it with
doctor
medicine
new
technology
but in the end
time be going to hunt you down
and make the kill

we be all
mortal Soran
it be
one of the truth of we
existence

what if i told you i find a new
truth

the nexus

time have no meaning there
the
predator have no tooth



where be he now

i do not know
he bathe
now
he be roam the ship
he must
be the only engineer in starfleet
who do not go to engineering



that the bottom border of the field follow the contour
of the root
but it do not extend underneath the arch

careful captain
that be a fifty
gigawatt forcefield
i would not
want to see you get hurt

thank you




finally



i would like to run a level three
diagnostic on the port plasma
relay
i think one of the
generator be fluctuate

okay let we do it



that be it
replay from time index fourtwo
nine

magnify this section and enhance

they shield be operating on a
modulation of twofiveseven point
four

adjust we torpedo frequency to
match twofiveseven point
four



sir i be detecting an anomalous
subspace read in main
engineering
it may be





they have find a way to penetrate
we shield

lock phasers and return fire





deanna take the helm
get we out
of orbit





hull breach on deck thirtyone
through thirtyfive

Worf that be an old klingon ship
what do we know about it
be
there any weakness

it be a class Dtwelve bird of
prey
they be retired from
service because of defective
plasma coil

plasma coil
be there any way
we can use that to we advantage

i do not see how
the plasma coil
be part of they cloak
device



get a stabilizer on that conduit



could we access the defective coil
and trigger they cloak

perhaps
yes
if we send a lowlevel ionic
pulse it might reset the coil and
engage the cloaking system

as they cloak begin to engage
they shield will drop

right
and they will be vulnerable
for at least two second
data lock onto that plasma coil

no problem

Worf prepare a spread of photon
torpedoe
we will have to hit they
the instant they begin to cloak

aye sir

we be only going to get one shot
at this
target they primary
reactor
with any luck they
warp core should implode





i have access they coil
frequency
initiate ionic
pulse

make it quick



target they bridge

full disruptors

we be cloak

what

mistress we shield be down





fire













do not you have anything good to
do




la forge to bridge
i have get a
problem down here
the magnetic
interlock have be rupture
i
need to get the

coolant leak
everybody out

bridge we have get a new problem
we be about five minute from a
warp core breach
there be nothing
i can do



deanna evacuate everyone into the
saucer section
mister data prepare to separate
the ship








now if you will excuse i captain
i have an appointment with
eternity and i do not want to be
late



that be it bridge we be all
out



one minute to warp core breach

begin separation sequence
full impulse power once we be
clear





separation complete
ten second
to warp core breach

engage impulse engine








report

helm control be offline


oh shit





disruptor still in he hand ready just in case picard
somehow survive
Soran peer through the cloud of
dust and debris
picard be go along with several foot of the ground
where he be crawling












i have rerout auxiliary power to
the lateral thruster
i be
attempting to level we descent

all hand brace for impact



















sky
time be almost up

down at the probe launcher and realize he be get one
chance
he roll to he foot run toward the probe
launcher
into the sky
toward the distant sun and disappear from view
picard get to he knee stare after the probe
shock
he be failed









what be going on
where be i





go on
say something
they be
waiting

i
do not know what to say

say merry christmas papa

merry
christmas

this one for you
where be
mine
i hope this be the book
i ask for
take this one to
papa

be not the tree beautiful papa

oh yes
yes it be astonishingly
beautiful
all of it

this be from all of we

thank you
i can not imagine what
it be

it be a sacktent

you mean a sextant
and it be a
handsome one at that
from about
eighteen twenty i would say
wherever do you find it

it be a secret

oh a secret
well that make
it a doubly special gift
thank
you
thank you all

merry christmas papa
i love
you father
etc

i will go get dinner ready
they will be starve in a minute






no
this be not right
this
can not be real

it be as real as you want it to be


Guinan
what be going on
where
be i

you be in the nexus

this
be the nexus

for you
this be where you wanted
to be

but i never have a wife child
a home like this

enjoy they JeanLuc

Guinan what be you do here
i think you be on the
enterprise

i be on the enterprise
i be
also here
think of i as
an echo of the
person you know
a part of she
she left behind

left behind

when the EnterpriseB beamed we
off the Lakul we be partially
in the nexus
the transporter
locked on to we
but somehow
everyone left a part of themselves
behind

Soran

all of we

where be he now

wherever he wanted to be

papa help i build i castle

in a few minute

continuing awed to
Guinan
these be i child
i
child

yeah
they be great be not they
you can go back and see they
born
go forward and see you
grandchildren
time have no
meaning here

dinner ready
let we go

papa
be you coming

go on
go on without i

Guinan
can i leave the nexus

why would you want to leave

can i

yes
where would you go

i do not understand

i told you time have no meaning
here
if you leave you can go
anywhere
any time

i know exactly where i want to
go
and when
back to that
mountaintop on Veridian three
before Soran put out the star
i
have to stop he

what make you think thing will
be any different this time

you be right
i will need help
Guinan will you come back with
i
together we could

i can not leave
i be already there
remember

i know just the guy



james kirk

beautiful day be not it

yes
yes it be

do you mind

oh

captain do you realize what

wait a second
i think
something burn



look like someone be cooking
egg
come on in it be all right
this
be i house or at least it used
to be i sell it year ago

i be captain JeanLuc picard of the
starship enterprise

this clock
i give this clock to
bone

i be from what you would consider
the future
the twentyfourth

temporal nexus

dill weed

the second shelf to the left
right behind the nutmeg

how long have you be here

i do not know
i be on the
EnterpriseB
in the deflector
control room
keep stirring
these will you

the bulkhead in front of i
disappear
then i be out
there chopping wood
thanks

history record that you die
saving the EnterpriseB from an
energy ribbon eighty year ago

so you be telling i this be the
twentyfourth century
and i be
dead

not exactly
as i said this be
some kind of

temporal nexus
yeah i hear you
something missing

captain i need you help
i want
you to leave the nexus with i



we have to go back to a planet
called Veridian and stop a
man from destroy a star
there
be millions of live at stake

you said history consider i
dead
who be i to argue with
history

you be a starfleet officer and you
have a duty to

i do not need to be lecture by
you
i be out saving the galaxy
when you grandfather be still in
diaper
and frankly i think the
galaxy owe i one
i be like you once
so worry
about duty and obligation that i
could not see anything past this
uniform
and in the end what do
it get i
nothing
not this
time

i be going to walk up these stairs
march into that bedroom and tell
antonia that i want to marry she

this time thing be going to be
different



re
barn
this do not look like you
bedroom

no
no it be not
it be good

well

this be i uncle barn in iowa

re
horse
i take that horse out for a ride
seven year ago
on a spring
day

just like this
if i be right
this be the day i meet antonia

this nexus of yours be very
clever
i can start all over
again do thing right from day
one




re
ravine
i must have make this jump fifty
time
and every time it scare
the hell out of i
but not this
time
because
it be not real

re
woman
antonia

she be not real either be she
nothing here be
nothing here
matter

it be kinda like
orbital
skydive
excit for a few
minute
but in the end you
have not really do anything
you have not make a difference

captain of the enterprise huh

that be right

close to retirement

i have not planned on it

well let i tell you something
do not
do not let they promote
you
do not let they transfer
you
do not let anything take you
off the bridge of that ship
because while you be there you
can make a difference

you do not need to be on the bridge
of a starship
come with i
help i stop Soran
make a difference again

how can i argue with the captain
of the enterprise
what be the name of that
planet
Veridian

that be right

i take it the odds be against we
and the situation be grim

you could say that

of course if spock be here
he would say i be be an
irrational illogical human for
wanting to go on a mission like
that

sound like fun



now if you will excuse i captain
i have an appointment with
eternity and i do not want to be
late


Soran jump down one level he disruptor still in his
hand ready just in case picard somehow survive
the dust
but picard be go along with
several foot of the ground where he be crawling



of it all
it will not respond
the control panel be
bizarre and confuse many different screen and
alien graphics
the alien countdown graphics continue
to race by


nothing he do have any effect
he keep hitting
button
looking for other control panel anything
to affect the launcher


Soran land heavily on the ground unconscious
kirk
stand over he breathing heavily
he hold he back
in pain that old back pain from the begin of the
movie

kirk there be a control in
he right pocket





the twentyfourth century be not so
tough






no





nice shot

i will find a way to contact the
enterprise
you be going to be
all right

do we do it
do we make a
difference

yes
thank you

least i could do
for a captain
of the enterprise

try to hang on

it be fun






captain be you all right

yes

what about doctor Soran

you need not worry about the doctor
anymore

be there a problem with the
klingon

you could say that






captain log stardate

the starship Farragut have arrive in
orbit and have begin to beam up
the enterprise survivor for transport
back to earth






we casualty be light
but
unfortunately the enterprise
herself cannot be salvage

that should be the last of the wound
doctor

two hundred thirtytwo patient in
under two day

save that stretcher

be there another patient

no that one for i




over here data
i think i have
find something

one life sign very faint


spot

i be very happy to find you spot

another family reunited

data
be you all right

i be not sure Counselor
i be
happy to see spot
and yet i be
crying

be malfunction again

i think it be work
perfectly




be this it

yes number one
thank you

i be going to miss this ship
she
go before she time

it be not how many year you have
live wil
but how you have live
they
someone once told i that time be
a predator that stalk we all we
live
but maybe time be also a
companion who go with we on
we journey and remind we to
cherish the moment of we
live
because they will never
come again
we be after all
only mortal

speak for yourself sir
i kinda
planned on living forever



i always think i would have a crack
at this chair one day

you may still
somehow i doubt
this will be the last ship to
carry the name enterprise

picard to Farragut
two to beam
up
