window of opportunity

now last summer we received a
dynamite young woman by way of

big idea
i first reaction be who

script that
works kind of like a tributary
taking you through the step of
firing someone

who be it for


theoretically you could put it in
the hand of anybody and they could
be downsize immediately
all they
have to do be follow the step

we prepare the newly unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdle
of job hunt while

we job be to make limbo tolerable
to ferry wound soul across the
river of dread and humiliation to
the point at which hope bright

pee on everything

now who be stereotyping

fear of mortality

and why do you suppose that be singular
to man

why would you sister
want a fake photo in front of the
st
louis airport

she should be so lucky to visit lambert
field
the wright brother fly through
there
point out the conical

the dome main terminal be the
first of it kind
precursor to
everything from to DeGualle

wow
pretty sweet

why she want dozens of reminder
of all the place she have not be
be beyond i

well i be sure she be going to be
crushed for have missed this airport

look before lindbergh could cross
the atlantic he take off from one of
those runway

fire the next one


i be here to be fired right

we be here to talk about you future

you do not have to sugar coat it
i get
the drill
what be they offering

inside the packet you will find a
clearly work out severance package

give i the bullet point

three month pay
six month
medical
full year of placement
service through we company

placement service
how generous


commonly it take one month of
searching for every ten thousand
dollar you expect to earn in salary

so i could be looking for a while

not necessarily

oh do not sweat it
i be pretty
confident about i plan

oh yeah

yeah
can you tell i
be high tide
in the morning or the evening

i do not know
why

there be this beautiful bridge by i
apartment
i need to figure out
what time to jump off it

people say these thing all the
time
it come with the trade

they do

sure
people be always saying
crazy stuff
they get work up

she be so calm


i think that be a good sign

so they do not actually ever do it

no
it be just talk

how do you know
do you follow up

i mean no nothing good can come
of that but i do not think you
should worry about it

this be the job
take people at
they most fragile moment and
setting they adrift



i will be back soon
not really sure
how long this whole exercise be
suppose to last
he be fine
it be
hard for these guy to accept
change you know
i
i be not even going to answer
that
no i can not even think of
he that way
he be old

okay
this be where it get a
little difficult but stay with i
you have a new backpack
but this
time i want you to fill it with
people
start with casual
acquaintance people around the
office friend of friend and work
you way to the people you trust
with you most intimate secret
now move into family member
cousin aunt and uncle
get
you sister and you brother and
you parent
get they all in that
backpack
and finally you husband
or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend
get they in they too


do not worry
i be not going to ask
you to light it on fire

feel the weight of that bag
make
no mistake you relationship be
the heavy component of you
life
feel the strap cutting into
you shoulder
all those
negotiation and argument and
secret and compromise

now set that bag down

you do not need to carry all that
weight

some animal be mean to carry
each other
to live symbiotically
over a lifetime
Starcrossed
lover
monogamous swan
we be
not one of those animal

the slow we move the fast we
die
we be not swan
we be
shark


never

you never want to get marry
never want kid

be that so bizarre

yes

sell it to i

what

sell i marriage

i
uh

Pff


okay
stability

how many stabile marriage do you
know

someone to talk to spend you life
with

i be surround by people to talk
to
i doubt that will change

how about just not dying alone

starting when i be twelve we
moved each one of i grandparent
into a nurse facility
i parent
go the same way
make no mistake
we all die alone

those cult member down in san
diego with the white sneaker and
little dixie cup of KoolAid
they
do not die alone

just saying there be option

over the internet

someone who fall for a prick

we all fall for they
prick be
spontaneous unpredictable and

fran when he get an offer from
ConAgra

compromise
i be suppose to do
something

you will do plenty

i just can not
i think i would be
engaged by now
no offense



when i be sixteen i think by
twenty three i would be marry
maybe have a kid
corner office
by day entertaining at night
i
be suppose to be driving a grand
cherokee by now

life can underwhelm you that way

now i have i sight on twenty
nine because thirty be just way
too
apocalyptic
i mean where
do you think you would be by

it do not work that way

at a certain point you stop with
the deadline

they can be a little counterproductive

i do not want to say anything
that be
antifeminist
i mean i
really appreciate everything you
generation do for i

i generation

it be we pleasure

well do

but sometimes it feel like no
matter how much success i have it
all will not matter until i find the
right guy

you really think this guy be the one


yeah i guess
i do not know
i
could have make it work
he just
really fit the bill

the bill

you know white collar
college grad

like funny
movie
six foot one
brown hair
kind eye

single syllable name like matt or
john or
dave
in a perfect
world he drive a four runner and
the only thing he love more than
i be he golden lab
oh
and a
nice smile
how about you

i be not sure if

well by the time you be thirty four
all the physical requirement be
pretty much out the window
i mean you
secretly prey he will be tall than you

not an asshole would be nice
just
someone who enjoy i company
come
from a good family you do not think
about that when you be young
want kid
like kid


want kid
healthy enough to play
catch with he future son one day

please let he earn more than i do
that do not make sense now but
believe i it will one day
otherwise
it be just a recipe for disaster
hopefully some hair on he head
but it be not exactly a dealbreaker
anymore
nice smile
yep a nice
smile just might do it

wow
that be depressing

i should just date lesbian

tried it
we be no picnic
ourselves

i do not mind be marry to i
career and i do not expect it to
hold i in bed as i fall asleep
i just do not want to settle

you be young
right now you see
settling as some sort of failure

it be
by definition

do not worry by the time someone be
right for you it will not feel like
settling
and the only person
left to judge you will be the
twenty four year old girl with a
target on you back


so what be the plan for this
evening

what
oh be it illicit

halfway across the state

foreign capital

in the good place on earth but now
i could see the world be really
just one place and compare do not
make much sense
