how do it go with feldman

great news
if he see brad five
day a week he say we will see
improvement in three to four
year

but
the election in two
month

right good point




we have be brainstorm on some
different approach and i think
we may have something solid here

i be all ear

guy

brad might act ghetto but let we
face it he be never be east of
beverly hills

but what if we give he a little
dose of reality

let he get a firsthand look at
the ghetto

you mean have brad actually
go
there

exactly

sound dangerous

it will be perfectly safe

how do it work

we hire actor to play gangster

they carjack brad then take he
on a tour of the hood
give
he a little taste of what thug
life really like
it might just
scare the black out of he




excuse i

look i be as down as the next
brother guy
fellah
i grow up
in compton okay
but let we get
over the

thing and face
fact
unless we do something
soon brad going to cost we this
election

i do not know
it sound so drastic

maybe drastic be what brad need
bill
he be twentyfour
i mean
what be he going to do for a live
rap

who do we get for the gangster

remember the anticrime spot we
shoot last month

we have get it cue up





for too long street violence have
torn californian apart






bill gluckman want to put we
division behind we



fella instead of think of
yourselves as what set you be
from or what crew you be rolling
with why can not you both be
brother
what do you say



i guess we never think of each
other like that



i neither dawg



you see
california be i family



if we work together as a family
there be no telling how high we can
go
