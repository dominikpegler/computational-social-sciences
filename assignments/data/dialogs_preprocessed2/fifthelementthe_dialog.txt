general Staedert remains calm

send out a probe
the president of the unite federation he feature lined

on air in second
in the middle of the group be a priest whose appearance remind we of

president on line sir
general Staedert lean over he screen and seem surprise to see the



Staedert do you read i

we be hope a
thermo nucleatic imaging

what you be saying be you do not know
what this
thing
be
consternation reign in the president office

not yet sir
the only thing we know be
it just keep get big

option

wait or act

recommendation

i philosophy mr
president be shoot first
ask question later
i do not like uninvited guest

gentleman

i think it would be foolish to shoot at an
organism that seem alive without first
taking the time to study it more
besides it have show no sign of hostility

no
it be just get big

so do people but that be no reason to shoot
they

the security of the federated territory be
and remains number one priority
i suppose general Staederts philosophy be
acceptable to you
all the general nod yes

all right then
Staedert



mr

the president scan the room
Staedert remote control the camera toward

i be listening

imagine for a moment that this
thing be not
anything that can be identified because it prefer
not to be because it be the antithesis of all we be
because it be evil


one more reason to shoot first eh
all the general nod in agreement

evil beget evil mr
president
shooting would only make it strong

the probe will attain it objective in
five second
Staedert move closer to the ship window
evil swallow the probe and immediately bubble over with activity like a

mr
president we be at crisis point
the president look puzzle

you theory be interesting father but

right now

time be of no importance mr

that be exactly what we be going to try and do
protect the live of some billion of we
fellow citizen
general
you may fire when ready

the rain fall
the wind blow
loc Rhod stand in front of he stone looking at Korben

Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beam
an indistinct white beam begin to form around she start to rise

come on Leeloo
come on
the beam lose it intensity
Leeloo crumple to the floor
the dark planet hurtle toward earth
hundred mile before impact
second tick away relentlessly on the scientist stopwatch

it will be enter the atmosphere in one
minute
the heat in the temple be unbearable
all the wall start to ooze the

Leeloo
if you do not get on with the
program we be all going to die

Korben wrap he arm around she and kiss she like he be never kiss
the beam harden and slowly solidify the evil planet
inaudible
stream of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
the pure beam the light of life have finished it work
the dark planet
strangely enough it look like the moon
everything be calm around it
president lindberg open he eye and realize he be not dead

the planet seem to have stopped at
mile from impact
in the temple the beam lose it intensity
but Leeloo and Korben
loc Rhod slip along the wall with a sigh
he give cornelius a know

this guy be a killer with the babe
i know it from the moment i laid eye
on he
cornelius and loc Rhod burst out laughing
Korben and Leeloo keep on
