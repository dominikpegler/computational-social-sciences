each other hand tight
the whole station seem
frozen the only movement from a thousand body being
jamal and Latika

i think we would meet again
only in death
he shake he head

i know you would be watch
jamal put he hand on Latikas chin turn she head
gently so that she be facing he
he see the knife
scar on she cheek for the first time
she try to
turn she head but he will not let she
run he hand
slowly down the scar
rest he hand there

this be we destiny
he gently kiss the scar cheek

this be we destiny
the camera pull back and back rising above the
station
the music start and the freeze station come
alive two thousand kurtaclad man and sareeclad woman
dancing in and out and on top of the train an unbind
celebration of hope and humanity that have at it
centre jamal and Latika
