chance to get off this rock

not likely
i have to cancel i
application
there have be a lot of
unrest among the Sandpeople since
you left
they have even raid the
outskirts of Anchorhead

you uncle could hold off a whole
colony of Sandpeople with one blaster

i know but he be get enough vaporators
going to make the place pay off
he
need i for just one more season
i
can not leave he now

i feel for you luke you be going
to have to learn what seem to be
important or what really be important
what good be all you uncle work
if it be taken over by the empire
you know they be starting to
nationalize commerce in the central
system
it will not be long before
you uncle be merely a tenant slave
for the great glory of the empire

it could not happen here
you said it
yourself
the empire will not bother
with this rock

thing always change

i wish i be going

maybe someday
i will keep a lookout

well i will be at the academy next
season
after that who know
i
will not be drafted into the imperial
starfleet that be for sure

translator to be sure it speak Bocce

it look like we do not have much of
a choice but i will remind he

i have no need for a protocol droid

sir not in an environment such as
this that be why i have also be
programme for over thirty secondary
function that

what i really need be a droid that
understand the binary language of
moisture vaporators

Vaporators
sir i first job be
program binary load lifter
very similar to you vaporators
you
could say

do you speak Bocce

it be like a
second language for i

fluent in Bocce

a malfunction

importance sir i believe
we

behave yourself Artoo
you be going
to get we in trouble
it be all right
you can trust he
he be we new
master

Kenobi a resident of these part
and it be a private message for he
quite frankly sir i do not know what
he be talking about
we last master
be captain antilles but with what
we have be through this little
unit have become a bit eccentric

ObiWan Kenobi
i wonder if he mean
old ben Kenobi

i beg you pardon sir but do you
know what he be talking about

well i do not know anyone named Obi
wan but old ben life out beyond
the dune sea
he be kind of a strange
old hermit

i wonder who she be
it sound like
she be in trouble
i would well play
back the whole thing

he say the restrain bolt have
short circuit he recording system
he suggest that if you remove the
bolt he might be able to play back
the entire recording

hm
oh yeah well i guess you be
too small to run away on i if i
take this off
okay

there you go

well wait a minute
where do she go

message

beru

i be sorry sir but he appear to
have pick up a slight flutter

all

no i do not like you either

you know i think that unit we
buy might have be stolen

what make you think that

well i stumble across a recording
while i be cleaning he
he say he
belong to someone called ObiWan
Kenobi

i think he might have mean old
ben
do you know what he be talking
about
well i wonder if he be related
to ben

that old mane just a crazy old
wizard
tomorrow i want you to take
that unit into Anchorhead and
have it memory flushed
Thatll be
the end of it
it belong to we now

but what if this ObiWan come looking
for he

he will not i do not think he exist
any more
he die about the same
time as you father

he know i father

i told you to forget it
you only
concern be to prepare the new droid
for tomorrow
in the morning i want
they on the south ridge working out
those condenser

yes sir
i think those new droid
be going to work out fine
in fact
i uh be also think about we
agreement about i stay on another
season
and if these new droid do
work out i want to transmit i
application to the academy this year

you mean the next semester before
harvest

sure there more than enough
droid

harvest be when i need you the most
only one more season
this year we will
make enough on the harvest so i will
be able to hire some more hand
and
then you can go to the academy next
year

you must understand i need you here
luke

but it be a whole another year

look it be only one more season

i told he not to go
but he be faulty malfunction
keep babbling on about he mission

oh no

that unit have always be a
problem
these astrodroids be
get quite out of hand
even i
can not understand they logic at time

how could i be so stupid
he be nowhere
in sight
blast it

pardon i sir but could not we go
after he

it be too dangerous with all the
Sandpeople around
we will have to
wait until morning

minute

he said he have some thing to do
before he start today so he left
early

with he

i think so

well he would well have those unit
in the south range repaired be midday
or there be hell to pay

how be that

old ben Kenobi life out in this
direction somewhere but i do not see
how that unit could have come
this far
we must have missed he
uncle owen be not going to take this
very well

sir would it help if you told he
it be i fault

only deactivate you for a day or
so

deactivate
well on the other hand
if you have not remove he restraining
bolt

wait there be something dead ahead
on the scanner
it look like we
droid
hit the accelerator

you into a million piece right here

well come on

see you

the Jundland waste be not to be
travele lightly
tell i young luke
what bring you out this far

oh this little droid
i think he be
searching for he former master
i have never see such devotion in a
droid before
there seem to be no
stopping he
he claim to be the
property of an ObiWan Kenobi
be he
a relative of yours
do you know who
he be talking about

ObiWan Kenobi
ObiWan
now that be
a name i have not hear in a long
time
a long time

i think i uncle know he
he said
he be dead

oh he be not dead not
not yet

you know he

well of course of course i know
he
he be i
i have not go by the
name ObiWan since oh before you
be born

then the droid do belong to you

do not seem to remember ever own a
droid
very interesting

i think we well get indoors
the
Sandpeople be easily startle but
they will soon be back and in great
number

Threepio

where be i
i must have taken a bad
step

can you stand
we have get to get out
of here before the Sandpeople return

i do not think i can make it
you go
on master luke
there be no sense in
you risking yourself on i account
i be do for

no you be not
what kind of talk be
that

quickly son
they be on the move

no i father do not fight in the
war
he be a navigator on a spice
freighter

that be what you uncle told you
he
do not hold with you father ideal
think he should have stay here
and not get involve

you fight in the clone war

yes i be once a jedi knight the
same as you father

i wish i would known he

he be the good starpilot in the
galaxy and a cunning warrior
i
understand you have become quite a
good pilot yourself
and he be a
good friend
which remind i

i have something here for you
you
father wanted you to have this when
you be old enough but you uncle
would not allow it
he feared you
might follow old ObiWan on some
damnedfool idealistic crusade like
you father do

sir if you will not be need i
i will close down for awhile

sure go ahead

what be it

you father lightsaber
this be the
weapon of a jedi knight
not as clumsy
or as random as a blaster

an elegant weapon for a more civilized
time
for over a thousand generation
the jedi knights be the guardian
of peace and justice in the old
republic
before the dark time
before the empire

how do i father die

young jedi named darth vader who
be a pupil of mine until he turned
to evil helped the empire hunt down
and destroy the jedi knights
he
betrayed and murdered you father
now the jedi be all but extinct
vader be seduce by the dark side
of the force

the force

well the force be what give a jedi
he power
it be an energy field
created by all live thing
it
surround we and penetrate we
it
bind the galaxy together

now let we see if we can not figure
out what you be i little friend
and where you come from

i see part of the message he be

i seem to have find it

general Kenobi year ago you serve
i father in the clone war
now he
beg you to help he in he struggle
against the empire
i regret that i
be unable to present i father
request to you in person but i
ship have fallen under attack and i be
afraid i mission to bring you to
Alderaan have failed
i have place
information vital to the survival of
the rebellion into the memory system
of this unit
i father will know
how to retrieve it
you must see
this droid safely deliver to he
on Alderaan
this be we most
desperate hour
help i ObiWan
Kenobi you be i only hope

you must learn the way of the force
if you be to come with i to Alderaan

Alderaan
i be not going to Alderaan
i have get to go home
it be late i be
in for it as it be

i need you help luke
she need
you help
i be get too old for
this sort of thing

i can not get involve
i have get work
to do
it be not that i like the
empire
i hate it
but there be nothing
i can do about it right now
it be
such a long way from here

that be you uncle talking

oh god i uncle
how be i ever
going to explain this

learn about the force luke

look i can take you as far as
Anchorhead
you can get a transport
there to mo Eisley or wherever you be
going

you must do what you feel be right
of course

until this battle station be fully
operational we be vulnerable
the
rebel alliance be too well equip
they be more dangerous than you
realize

dangerous to you starfleet
commander not to this battle station

the rebellion will continue to gain
a support in the imperial senate as
long as

the imperial senate will no longer
be of any concern to we
i have just
receive word that the emperor have
dissolved the council permanently
the last remnant of the old republic
have be sweep away

that be impossible
how will the
emperor maintain control without the
bureaucracy

the regional governor now have direct
control over territory
fear will
keep the local system in line
fear
of this battle station

and what of the rebellion
if the
rebel have obtain a complete
technical readout of this station
it be possible however unlikely
that they might find a weakness and
exploit it

the plan you refer to will soon be
back in we hand

any attack make by the rebel against
this station would be a useless
gesture no matter what technical
data they have obtain
this station
be now the ultimate power in the
universe
i suggest we use it

do not be too proud of this
technological terror you have
constructed
the ability to destroy
a planet be insignificant next to
the power of the force

do not try to frighten we with you
sorcerer way lord vader
you
sad devotion to that ancient religion
have not helped you conjure up the
steal data tape or given you
clairvoyance enough to find the
rebel hide fort

i find you lack of faith disturb

enough of this
vader release he

as you wish

this bicker be pointless
lord
vader will provide we with the
location of the rebel fortress by
the time this station be operational
we will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke

it look like Sandpeople do this
all right
look here be Gaffi
stick Bantha track
it be just
i never hear of they hitting anything
this big before

they do not
but we be mean to
think they do
these track be
side by side
Sandpeople always ride
single file to hide there number

these be the same Jawas that sold
we Artoo and Threepio

and these blast point too accurate
for Sandpeople
only imperial
stormtrooper be so precise

why would imperial troop want to
slaughter Jawas

if they trace the robot here they
may have learned who they sold they
to
and that would lead they home

wait luke
it be too dangerous

uncle owen
aunt beru
uncle owen

and now you highness we will
discuss the location of you hide
rebel base

there be nothing you could have do
luke have you be there
you would have
be killed too and the droid
would be in the hand of the empire

i want to come with you to Alderaan
there be nothing here for i now
i
want to learn the way of the force
and become a jedi like i father

mo Eisley spaceport
you will never
find a more wretched hive of scum
and villainy
we must be cautious

how long have you have these droid

about three or four season

they be for sale if you want they

let i see you identification

you do not need to see his
identification

we do not need to see his
identification

these be not the droid you looking
for

these be not the droid we be looking
for

he can go about he business

you can go about you business

move along

move along
move along

i can not abide these Jawas
disgusting
creature

go on go on
i can not understand how
we get by those trooper
i think
we be dead

the force can have a strong influence
on the weakminded
you will find it
a powerful ally

do you really think we be going to
find a pilot here that take we to
Alderaan

well most of the good freighter
pilot can be find here
only watch
you step
this place can be a little
rough

i be ready for anything

come along Artoo

we do not serve they kind here

what

you droid
they will have to wait
outside
we do not want they here

listen why do not you wait out by
the speeder
we do not want any
trouble

i heartily agree with you sir

Negola dewaghi wooldugger

he do not like you

i be sorry

i do not like you either

do not insult we
you just watch
yourself
we be wanted man
i have
the death sentence in twelve system

i will be careful than

you will be dead

this little one be not worth the
effort
come let i buy you
something

no blaster
no blaster

this be chewbacca
he be firstmate
on a ship that might suit we need

i do not like the look of this

han solo
i be captain of the
millennium falcon
Chewie here tell
i you be looking for passage to the
Alderaan system

yes indeed
if it be a fast ship

fast ship
you have never hear of the
millennium falcon

should i have

it be the ship that make the kessel
run in less than twelve parsec

i have outrun imperial starship not
the local bulkcruisers mind you
i be talking about the big Corellian
ship now
she be fast enough for
you old man
what be the cargo

only passenger
myself the boy
two droid and no question ask

what be it
some kind of local
trouble

let we just say we would like to avoid
any imperial entanglement

well that be the trick be not it
and it be going to cost you something
extra
ten thousand in advance

ten thousand
we could almost buy
we own ship for that

but who be going to fly it kid
you

you bet i could
i be not such a bad
pilot myself
we do not have to sit
here and listen

we have not that much with we
but we
could pay you two thousand now plus
fifteen when we reach Alderaan

seventeen huh

okay
you guy get yourself a ship
we will leave as soon as you be ready
dock bay Ninetyfour

Ninetyfour

look like somebody beginning to
take an interest in you handiwork

all right we will check it out

seventeen thousand
those guy must
really be desperate
this could really
save i neck
get back to the ship
and get she ready

you will have to sell you speeder

that be okay
i be never coming back
to this planet again

go somewhere solo

yes Greedo
as a matter of fact i
be just going to see you boss
tell Jabba that i have get he money

it be too late
you should have paid
he when you have the chance
Jabbas
put a price on you head so large
that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you
i be lucky i
find you first

yeah but this time i get the money

if you give it to i i might forget
i find you

i do not have it with i
tell Jabba

Jabbas through with you
he have no
time for smuggler who drop they
shipment at the first sign of an
imperial cruiser

even i get board sometimes
do you
think i have a choice

you can tell that to Jabba
he may
only take you ship

over i dead body

that be the idea
i have be looking
forward to killing you for a long
time

yes i will bet you have

sorry about the mess

she resistance to the mind probe be
considerable
it will be some time
before we can extract any information
from she

the final checkout be complete
all
system be operational
what course
shall we set

perhaps she would respond to an
alternative form of persuasion

what do you mean

i think it be time we demonstrate
the full power of this station
set you course for princess Leias
home planet of Alderaan

with pleasure

lock the door Artoo

all right check that side of the
street
it be secure
move on to the
next door

i would much rather have go with
master luke than stay here with you
i do not know what all the trouble be
about but i be sure it must be you
fault

you watch you language

he say it be the good he can do
since the come out they be
just not in demand

it will be enough

if the ship as fast as he be
boasting we ought to do well

come on out solo

i have be waiting for you Jabba

i expect you would be

i be not the type to run

han i boy there be time when
you disappoint i
why have not you
paid i
and why do you have to fry
poor Greedo like that
after all
we have be through together

you send Greedo to blast i

han why you be the good smuggler in
the business
you be too valuable to
fry
he be only relay i concern
at you delay
he be not going to
blast you

i think he think he be
next time
do not send one of those twerps
if
you have get something to say to i
come see i yourself

han han
if only you have not have to
dump that shipment of spice
you
understand i just can not make an
exception
where would i be if every
pilot who smuggle for i dump
they shipment at the first sign of
an imperial starship
it be not good
business

you know even i get board
sometimes Jabba
i have no choice
but i have get a charter now and i can
pay you back plus a little extra
i
just need some more time

put you blaster away
han i boy
i be only do this because you be
the good and i need you
so for an
extra say twenty percent i will give
you a little more time
but this
be it
if you disappoint i again
i will put a price on you head so
large you will not be able to go near a
civilized system for the rest of
you short life

Jabba i will pay you because it be i
pleasure

what a piece of junk

she will make point five beyond the
speed of light
she may not look
like much but she be get it where it
count kid
i have added some special
modification myself

we be a little rushed so if you will
hurry aboard we will get out of here

hello sir

which way

all right man
load you weapon

stop that ship

blast they

Chewie get we out of here

oh i
i would forgotten how much i
hate space travel

it look like an imperial cruiser
we passenger must be hot than i
thought
try and hold they off
angle
the deflector shield while i make
the calculation for the jump to
light speed

stay sharp
there be two more coming
in
they be going to try to cut we
off

why do not you outrun they
i think
you said this thing be fast

watch you mouth kid or you be
going to find yourself floating home
we will be safe enough once we make
the jump to hyperspace
besides i
know a few maneuver
we will lose
they

here where the fun begin

how long before you can make the
jump to light speed

it will take a few moment to get the
coordinate from the navicomputer

be you kidding
at the rate they be
gain

travel through hyperspace be not
like dust crop boy
without
precise calculation we could fly
right through a star or bounce too
close to a supernova and that would end
you trip real quick would not it

what be that flashing

we be losing we deflector shield
go strap yourself in i be going to
make the jump to light speed

we have enter the Alderaan system

governor Tarkin i should have
expected to find you holding Vaders
leash
i recognized you foul stench
when i be bring on board

charming to the last
you do not know
how hard i find it signing the order
to terminate you life

i surprise you have the courage to
take the responsibility yourself

princess Leia before you execution
i would like you to be i guest at a
ceremony that will make this battle
station operational
no star system
will dare oppose the emperor now

the more you tighten you grip
Tarkin the more star system will
slip through you finger

not after we demonstrate the power
of this station
in a way you have
determined the choice of the planet
that be destroyed first
since
you be reluctant to provide we with
the location of the rebel base i
have chosen to test this station
destructive power
on you home
planet of Alderaan

no
Alderaan be peaceful
we have no
weapon
you can not possibly

you would prefer another target

military target
then name the system

i grow tire of asking this
so it will
be the last time
where be the rebel
base

Dantooine

they be on Dantooine

there
you see lord vader she can
be reasonable
continue with the operation
you may
fire when ready

what

you be far too trust
Dantooine
be too remote to make an effective
demonstration
but do not worry
we
will deal with you rebel friend
soon enough

no

commence primary ignition

be you all right
what be wrong

i feel a great disturbance in the
force
as if millions of voice
suddenly cry out in terror and
be suddenly silence
i fear
something terrible have happen

you would well get on with you
exercise

well you can forget you trouble
with those imperial slug
i told
you i would outrun they

do not everyone thank i at once

anyway we should be at Alderaan
about ohtwohundred hour

now be careful Artoo

he make a fair move
screaming about
it will not help you

let he have it
it be not wise to
upset a Wookiee

but sir nobody worry about
upsetting a droid

that be because droid do not pull
people arm out of they socket
when they lose
Wookiees be known
to do that

i see you point sir
i suggest a
new strategy Artoo
let the Wookiee
win

remember a jedi can feel the force
flowing through he

you mean it control you action

partially
but it also obey you
command

hokey religion and ancient weapon
be no match for a good blaster at
you side kid

you do not believe in the force do
you

kid i have fly from one side of
this galaxy to the other
i have see
a lot of strange stuff but i have
never see anything to make i believe
there be one allpowerful force
controlling everything
there be no
mystical energy field that control
i destiny

it be all a lot of simple trick and
nonsense

i suggest you try it again luke

this time let go you conscious
self and act on instinct

with the blast shield down i can not
even see
how be i suppose to fight

you eye can deceive you
do not
trust they

stretch out with you feeling

you see you can do it

i call it luck

in i experience there be no such
thing as luck

look going good against remote be
one thing
go good against the
live
that be something else

look like we be coming up on
Alderaan

you know i do feel something
i
could almost see the remote

that be good
you have taken you
first step into a large world

yes

we scout ship have reach
Dantooine
they find the remain of
a rebel base but they estimate that
it have be deserted for some time
they be now conducting an extensive
search of the surround system

she lie
she lie to we

i told you she would never consciously
betray the rebellion

terminate she
immediately

stand by Chewie here we go
cut in
the sublight engine

what the
aw we have come out of
hyperspace into a meteor shower
some kind of asteroid collision
it be not on any of the chart

what be going on

we position be correct except
no Alderaan

what do you mean
where be it

that be what i be trying to tell you
kid
it be not there
it be be totally
blown away

what
how

destroy
by the empire

the entire starfleet could not destroy
the whole planet
it would take a thousand
ship with more fire power than
i have

there be another ship coming in

maybe they know what happen

it be an imperial fighter

it follow we

no
it be a short range fighter

there be not any base around here
where do it come from

it sure be leaving in a big hurry
if they identify we we be in big
trouble

not if i can help it
Chewie
jam
it be transmission

it would be as well to let it go
it be
too far out of range

not for long

fighter that size could not get
this deep into space on it own

it must have get lost be part
of a convoy or something

well he be not going to be around
long enough to tell anyone about we

look at he
he be headed for that
small moon

i think i can get he before he get
there
he be almost in range

that be no moon
it be a space station

it be too big to be a space station

i have a very bad feel about this

yeah i think you right
full
reverse
Chewie lock in the auxiliary
power

why be we still moving towards it

we be catch in a tractor beam
it be
pulling we in

but there be get to be something you
can do

there be nothing i can do about it
kid
i be in full power
i be going to
have to shut down
but they be not
going to get i without a fight

you can not win
but there be
alternative to fight

to you station
come with i

close all outboard shield
close
all outboard shield

yes

we have capture a freighter enter
the remain of the Alderaan system
it be marking match those of a ship
that blasted it way out of mo
Eisley

they must be trying to return the
steal plan to the princess
she
may yet be of some use to we

unlock onefiveseven and nine
release charge

there be no one on board sir
accord to the log the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff
it must be a decoy sir
several of
the escape pod have be jettison

do you find any droid

no sir
if there be any on board
they must also have jettison

send a scan crew on board
i
want every part of this ship check

yes sir

i sense something
a presence i
have not feel since

get i a scan crew in here on
the double
i want every part of
this ship check

boy it be lucky you have these
compartment

i use they for smuggling
i never
think i would be smuggling myself in
they
this be ridiculous
even if i
could take off i would never get past
the tractor beam

leave that to i

damn fool
i know that you be going
to say that

who be the more foolish
the fool
or the fool who follow he

the ship all yours
if the scanner
pick up anything report it
immediately
all right let we go

hey down there could you give we a
hand with this

TXfouronetwo
why be not you at
you post
TXfouronetwo do you
copy

take over
we have get a bad
transmitter
i will see what i can do

you know between he howl and
you blast everything in sight
it be a wonder the whole station
do not know we be here

bring they on
i prefer a straight
fight to all this sneak around

we find the computer outlet sir

plug in
he should be able to
interpret the entire imperial computer
network

he say he be find the main computer
to power the tractor beam that be
holding the ship here
he will try to
make the precise location appear on
the monitor

the tractor beam be coupled to the
main reactor in seven location

power loss at one of the terminal
will allow the ship to leave

i do not think you boy can help
i
must go alone

whatever you say
i have do more
that i bargain for on this trip
already

i want to go with you

be patient luke
stay and watch
over the droid

but he can

they must be deliver safely or
other star system will suffer the
same fate as Alderaan
you destiny
lie along a different path than
mine
the force will be with you
always

great kid

there be still two more of they out
there

that be it
we do it

we do it

help
i think i be melting
this be all you fault

be they away

they have just make the jump into
hyperspace

you be sure the home beacon be
secure aboard they ship
i be taking
an awful risk vader
this have good
work

not a bad bit of rescue huh
you
know sometimes i even amaze myself

that do not sound too hard
besides
they let we go
it be the only
explanation for the ease of we
escape

easy
you call that easy

they tracking we

not this ship sister

at least the information in Artoo be
still intact

what be so important
what be he
carrying

the technical readout of that battle
station
i only hope that when the
data be analyzed a weakness can be
find
it be not over yet

it be for i sister
look i be not
in this for you revolution and i be
not in it for you princess
i expect
to be well paid
i be in it for the
money

you need not worry about you reward
if money be all that you love then
that be what you will receive

you friend be quite a mercenary
i
wonder if he really care about
anything
or anyone

i care

so
what do you think of she han

i be trying not to kid

good

still she be get a lot of spirit
i
do not know what do you think
do
you think a princess and a guy like
i

no

you be safe
we have feared the bad

when we hear about Alderaan we
be afraid that you be
lost
along with you father

we do not have time for we sorrow
commander
the battle station have
surely track we here
looking pointedly to
han
it be the only explanation for the
ease of we escape
you must use the
information in this unit to plan
the attack
it be we only hope

yes

the battle station be heavily shielded
and carry a firepower great than
half the star fleet
it be defenses
be design around a direct large
scale assault
small oneman fighter
should be able to penetrate the outer
defense

pardon i for asking sir but what
good be snub fighter going to be
against that

well the empire do not consider a
small oneman fighter to be any
threat or they would have a tight
defense
an analysis of the plan
provide by princess Leia have
demonstrated a weakness in the battle
station

the approach will not be easy
you
be required to maneuver straight
down this trench and skim the surface
to this point
the target area be
only two meter wide
it be a small
thermal exhaust port right below
the main port
the shaft lead
directly to the reactor system

precise hit will start a chain
reaction which should destroy the
station

only a precise hit will set up a
chain reaction
the shaft be ray
shielded so you will have to use proton
torpedoe

that be impossible even for a
computer

it be not impossible
i used to bull
eye womp rat in i Tsixteen back
home
they be not much big than
two meter

man you ship
and may the force be
with you

this will be a day long remember
it have see the end of Kenobi and it
will soon see the end of the
rebellion

all flight trooper man you station
all flight troop man you station

so
you get you reward and you be
just leaving then

that be right yeah
i get some old
debt i have get to pay off with this
stuff
even if i do not you do not
think i would be fool enough to stick
around here do you
why do not you
come with we
you be pretty good in
a fight
i could use you

come on
why do not you take a look
around
you know what be about to
happen what they be up against
they could use a good pilot like
you
you be turning you back on
they

what good a reward if you be not
around to use it
besides attacking
that battle station be not i idea of
courage
it be more like suicide

all right
well take care of
yourself han
i guess that be what
you be best at be not it
