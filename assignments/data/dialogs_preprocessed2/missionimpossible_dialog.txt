europe



for security reason the list be
divided into two encode halve
golitsyn already have the cryptonym
portion which contain agent code name

this portion be
useless unless combined with the second
half the true name list that be keep
in the station in we embassy in prague



we believe golitsyn plan to steal the
true name list at an embassy function
tomorrow night

decide to accept it be to obtain
photographic proof of the theft apprehend
those involve and return the steal
list

PRlKOPY


the message be for job

why

you wish to meet max
this be the price
of admission

i think i be going to see max

you misunderstand
no one see max

then what be i do here

allow max to see you and hear what
you have get to say

i do not communicate very well through a
shroud

if max do not like what you have to say
you will be wearing that shroud
indefinitely

i be will to take the chance

very well

who be you and what be you do here

i need one hundred thousand dollar

really
and you think if you simply
show up i might give it to you

why not
you give job a hundred and
twenty five thousand

the penny drop
you
be
not
job
yes
job be not given to quoting scripture in
he communication
and there be it
tone aggressive but playful
job be
not playful
so you be something of a
paradox

that depend

on what

whether you like a paradox
i want a
hundred and fifty thousand dollar

it be quite out of the question

the disk job sold you be worthless
it be
bait part of an internal molehunt

and how might you know that
be you
another company man

like job

ah but we be asking about you

i be
be
now
disavow

why may i ask

that be the question i want to ask job

i do not know job any more than he know
i

even so i be sure you could arrange an
introduction

why should i

because i can deliver the actual
list
the one you have be not only
worthless it be certain to be equip
with a home device to pinpoint you
exact location

it be easy to say the disk be worthless
when you say i can not look at the
information and
see
if it be worthless
not a tenable position sir

okay boot it up and in anywhere from
thirty second to ten minute you be
going to have virginia farm boy hopping
