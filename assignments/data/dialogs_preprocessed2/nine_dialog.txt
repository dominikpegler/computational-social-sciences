you kill you film several time
mostly by talking about it
film be
a dream
you kill it writing it down
you kill it with a camera
the film
might come to life for a moment or two
when you actor breathe life back
into it but then it die again
buried in film can
mysteriously
sometimes in the edit room a
miracle happen when you place one
image next to another so that when
finally an audience sit in the dark
if you be lucky very lucky and
sometimes i have be lucky the dream
flicker back to life again

actually it be i short title yet

but hardly a modest one

film be not modest
they cost too
