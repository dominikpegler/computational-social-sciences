what you writin this time

i be writing a poem about we
i be
writing we story

oh be you
let we hear it
if
it be good i will mail it in to the
law and it will be printed in all the
paper again

just let i finish this line


okay here it be

the story of bonnie and clyde
you have hear the story of jesse
james
of how he live and die
if you be still in need
of something to read
here the story of bonnie and
clyde
now bonnie and clyde be the barrow
gang
i be sure you all have read
how they rob and steal
and those who squeal
be usually find die or dead
they call they coldhearted killer
they say they be heartless and
mean
but i say this with pride
that i once know clyde
when he be honest and upright and
clean
but the law fool around
keep taking he down
and locking he in a cell
till he said to i
i will never be free
so i will meet a few of they in
hell

the road be so dimly light
there be no highway sign to
guide
but they make up they mind
if all road be blind
they would not give up till they die



the road get dim and dim
sometimes you can hardly see
but it be fight man to man
and do all you can
for they know they can never be
free
from heartbreak some people have
suffer
from weariness some people have
die
but take it all in all
we trouble be small
till we get like bonnie and clyde



if a policeman be killed in dallas
and they have no clue or guide
if they can not find a fiend
they just wipe they slate clean
and hang it on bonnie and clyde

if they try to act like citizen
and rent they a nice little flat
about the third night
they be invited to fight
by a subguns rattattat
some day they will go down together
they will bury they side by side
to few it will be grief
to the law a relief
but it be death for bonnie and clyde
