the crown negotiating the term of service

explain to the major we care little about toy
with colonial militia because we have little to
fear from the french
they have not the nature
for war
they latinate voluptuousness combine with
they gallic laziness and the result be
they would

Headin west

i think all we colonial scout be in
the militia

i be not you scout
and i be in no damn
militia

then you be one of those who would allow
england to fight alone while she protect
you from france

england do not protect i and do not
war against france on we account
she use
we to war against france on she own account
of greed for land and fur

clear it up any

i owe you gratitude or i would call you out

Yengeese no good in wood

who be these people

re
print
ottawa

excuse i

ottawa

mirror
tool
clothes
all inside

Movin fast not able to carry much
this be a war party

let we look after they

leave they

though they be stranger they be at
least entitle to a christian burial

let we go miss

i will not
i have see the face of war
before mr
poe but never war make on
woman and child
and almost as
cruel be you indifference

miss munro
they be not stranger
and they stay as they lay

why do not you bury those people

anyone lookin to pick up we trail would
see it as a sign of we pass

you know they

you be acting for we benefit
and i
apologize
i misunderstand you

well that be to be expected
i father

you father

chingachgook
he warn i about
people like you

he do

yes
he said
do not try to make they
understand you


what

yes
and do not try to understand they
that be because they be a breed apart and
they make no sense


why do they turn back

we be a breed apart and we make no
sense

in you particular case miss i would
make some allowance

thank you so much

you called chingachgook you father
where be you real family

they bury i ma pa and i sister
and chingachgook who find i with
two french trapper raised i up as his
own

i be sorry

i do not remember they
i be one or two

how do you learn english

i father send uncas i to reverend
Wheelocks school when i be ten
so
we would know both world
though
we be tell only bother learn readin
arithmetic from yous

and what be the consequentialities of
european culture you do not bother with

the bible
monarchy
many wrong idea
about the government of man
i father
people already know each man be he own
nation
and only he can have dominion
over himself
not king
no man be good
than any other man

in london those radical idea could land
you in newgate prison
why be those people living in this
defenseless place

cos frontier land the only land affordable
to poor people
so after seven year
indentured service in virginia they headed
out here where they be beholden to none
and not livin by another leave
they name be cameron
john alexandria

continue
looking up
i father people say
at the birth of the
sun and of he brother the moon they
mother die
so the sun give to the earth
she body from which be to spring all life
and he draw forth from she breast the star
the star he threw into the night sky to
remind he of she soul
so there be the camerons monument
i folk too i guess

you be right mr
poe
we do not
understand what be happening here
and it be not as i imagined it would be
think of it in boston and london

sorry to disappoint you

on the contrary

to i blood

i be sorry i do not mean to

she nerve be shattered
she be trying
to be brave

cora i adore you and when we come together
we will be the happy couple in england
i be certain of that
more than ever before
i believe you must trust the judgment of other
who hold you welfare so close to they heart

duncan
duncan i promised you an answer
you
have compliment i with you persistence
and patience
but the decision i have come
to be i would rather make the grave of mistake
than surrender i own judgment

and it be be unfair to you while i search
myself for feeling which if they be
there and as strong as they ought to be
would have make themselves known long ago
take i admiration and friendship duncan
and please take this as i final answer
it must be no

i see

i be sorry duncan



it be no raidin party out for pillage
the
cabin be attack by a war party
they be
sweep south down the frontier spread
terror among farm and mohawk village cos
all the man be here



and i cabin not thirteen mile south of
camerons

i must receive proof more conclusive than
mr
Poes opinion before i weaken we
defenses by allow militia to withdraw

Chingachgooks of the same opinion
take
together that be gospel
you fort will stand
or fall depending on webb and reinforcement
not these colonial presence

i judge military matter captain winthrop not
you

that judgment be not more important than they
right under agreement with webb to defend they
farm family
major heyward be at john
camerons
he see what it be

looking to heyward for
confirmation of he point of view
what do you see major

i see nothing that would lead i to the
conclusion it be other than a raid by savage
bent on thievery

you be a liar

and the blood be on you hand

i will have none of that
montcalm be a soldier and a gentleman
not a butcher

easy for you to suppose
while it be they
woman and child not yours alone in
they farm

you forget yourself

we be not forgettin webbs promise

british promise be honore
and the militia
will not be released
because i need more
definite proof than this mane word

Nathaniels word be good on the frontier a
long time before you get here

this interview over
the militia stay

do the rule of english law no longer govern
have it be replace by absolutism

and if english law cannot be trusted maybe
these people would do good makin a peace
with the french

that be sedition
treason

that be the truth

i ought to have you whip from this fort

major
some day i think you and i be going to have
a serious disagreement

anyone foment or advocate leaving
fort william henry will be hung for sedition
anyone leaving will be shoot for desertion
i decision be final
get out
because of the policy of cold and distant european monarch

get no kin in the settlement
if i do
i would be long go

you do not think it right to be here in the
first place

by i light that be how i see it then and i
see it that way now

but we be under english military authority

i believe if they set aside they law as and when
they wish they law no longer have rightful
authority over we
all they have over we be
tyranny then
and i will stay here no longer
no force on earth will keep i here
anyone
caught leavin the fort could be shoot
so each
man make you own decision
those who
be going be back here in an hour

out the northern sallyport
strike for the east
side of the swamp until you clear the french
picket line
head north over the ridge then
come about southeast and fork left in little
meadow and you be free of the outpost and
skirmisher

should have skin outta this long ago

get no family captain
figure we would stay
and give they a hand even though

i will cover they from the top of the casement

you be not coming with we

get a reason to stay

that reason wear a blue dress and work
in the surgery

it do and it be a good lookin reason
than you jack winthrop
push hard cos you get to clear the french
outpost by dawn
stick out he hand and
grasp Winthrops
good luck jack
someone catch he eye and he move in that direction



you
halt

as you be

take he

mohican
subtitled
why do they make i son prisoner

mohican
subtitled
i helped winthrop and the other leave
this fight be not yours father
i love
you and i brother
and you should leave
this place now and go to Cantuckee

mohican
subtitled
what will they do with i white son

get back from he

he saved we
we be alive only because
of he

the man encourage the colonial to desert
in this very room in i presence
he be
guilty of sedition and must be tried and hang
like any other criminal regardless of what he
do for i child

he know the consequence
and he stay
be those the action of a criminal
duncan do something

he know the penalty for breaking regulation
he ought to pay without sending you to beg

you know he would not send i
you
misrepresent what you see and cause
this
i too be at that farm
it be as he said

not with enough certainty to outweigh british
interest in this fort

and who empower these provincial to pass
judgment upon englands policy in she own
colony
to come and go without so much as
a by you leave


they do not live they live by you leave

they hack it out of the wilderness with
they own two hand bury they dead and
they child along the way

you be defending he because you have become
infatuated with he

duncan you be a man with a few admirable
quality
but taken as a whole i be wrong
to have think so highly of you

but the man be guilty of sedition and subject
to military justice and beyond pardon

sooner french gun blow the english army
out of america the good it will be for
these people

array against you

monsieur le marquis i be a soldier not a
diplomat
you called this parlay for a reason

you have already do everything which be
necessary for the honor of you prince

honor that be freely accord to courage may
be refuse obstinacy
these hill afford to
we every opportunity to reconnoiter you

hudson and he know the size and imminence
of the army of webb

i scout intercepted this dispatch intended
for you

read

impossible
i advise you to seek term for
surrender
sign webb


this be the signature of webb

than spend the war in a french prison hulk
in hudson bay they would fight to the end

you have hear you answer monsieur le
marquis

you man will see the inside of a prison
barge
they be free to go so long as they
return to england and fight no more on this
continent and the civilian militia return to

allow i to consult with i officer

and
a frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage

general webb can burn in hell
we will go back
and dig we grave behind the rampart
we
mission be to fight

death and honor be sometimes think to be

Wampum

Yengeese major give all property to magua
magua give Yengeese major much wampum
many gift maybe three four ox

gold could be arranged

for munro child

yes

how much gold have the master of the
Yengeese

the king
the king have mountain of
gold

not enough

what be enough

heart
give magua new heart

in huron
subtitled
the tomahawks of you young man have
be very red

in huron
subtitled
many of the Yengeese be dead great
Sachem
i have bring three of i prisoner
to honor you
two be the child
of munro
whose scalp hang on i
lodge pole
and whose heart i cut from
he chest

the earth be pale
we tomahawks
be bright
now they be dull from war
and the huron rich with the trophy of
honor
magua will sell the english
officer to les francais and the reward be
i gift to you wise one
the woman
child of the white war chief will burn
in we fire so all can share in this

nathaniel

to heyward
low
translate for i major
into french
every word
as i say it

i come to you unarmed and in peace to
unstop you ear wise one
because the
huron be mislead by the word of the
wolf who be never spoken the truth

let the child of the dead colonel munro
go free and take the fire out of the english
anger over the murder of they helpless one

we father montcalm be great than the
Yengeese in the art of war
the huron
do not fear english anger

wise one the french father make peace
and swear to they honor not to break the
friendship
magua broke it
it be false that
the french would not be friend still to
the huron

it make we french father happy to never
have to fight the same Yengeese again
he told i this without telling i this

so the huron be the servant of the french
to do what the french be shame to do

no
huron serve no one
the french father
believe he fool magua because he be so
proud of he cleverness he be blind
but it
be the huron path that magua walk down
not the french one
now les francais
also fear huron
that be good
when the
huron be strong from they fear we will make
the term of trade with les francais
and we
will trade as the white man trade
take land
from the Abnakes
fur from the Osage Sauk
fox
and make the huron great
over
other tribe
no less than the white as strong
as the white

magua would use the way of les francais
and the Yengeese

the red man put down the bow picked up
the fire stick and become the good warrior
in the forest
yes
it be the only way

would the huron make he algonquin brother
foolish with brandy and steal he land to sell
they for gold to the white man
would the
huron have greed for more land than a man
can use
like francais black robe do
would huron kill tribe with disease
would
the huron fool seneca into taking all the
animal in the forest for bead brandy
but
sell the fur to the white man for gold

those be the way of Yengeese and les
francais master
be they the way of huron
man who hunt work the land
or of dog
Maguas heart be twisted
he would make
himself into what twisted he
dog become
master of dog
but be huron dog
Maguas way be false
it be like the white
sickness
Maguas way will bring only sadness
and shame
be there another way
i do not know
i be nathaniel of the Yengeese
hawkeye
adopt son of chingachgook of the mohican
people
let the child of the dead munro go
free
i speak the truth

the white man come like a day that have
passed
and night enter we future with
he
we council talk since i be a boy
what be the huron to do
but magua would lead huron down path
that make we not huron
dark girl burn in fire to heal the twist
heart of magua

munro daughter with moon in she hair
must be Maguas wife so munros seed
do not die

continue
dissolve
back to french
and Yengeese officer not go to les
francais but back to Yengeese so they
hatred burn less bright
la longue Carabine
go in peace

no
listen
tell he i will trade he
i for she
tell he

i be la longue Carabine
i death be a
great honor to the huron

cousin
and in the spring cross the
ohio and look for land to settle with i
father in a new place called Cantuckee

the frontier move with the sun and push
the red man of the wilderness forest in front
of it
until one day there will be nowhere left
then we race will be no more or be not we
the frontier place be for people like i white
son and he woman and they child

that be i father sadness talking

no
it be true
one day
there will be no
more frontier
then man like you will go too
like the mohican
and new people will come
work
struggle
to make they light
one mystery remain

what be that
