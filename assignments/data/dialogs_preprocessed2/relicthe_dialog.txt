questioning for the rest of the day
obviously we will all do everything
we can to cooperate
be there any
question

the party for the open of the
superstition exhibit
i imagine in
the light of what be happen it will
be push back

no action have be taken yet
the
open of the exhibit be crucial to
the financial health of this museum
so for now we expect that the
superstition exhibit will open on
schedule tomorrow night

that cuthbert
what a piece of work
Someones dead and all he care
about be he superstition exhibit

cuthberts counting on the
exhibition success
the museum be
in debt
contribution and public
fund have dried up
admission no
longer cover overhead
the last big
infusion of cash we have be the king
tut exhibit
cuthbert be hired to
get we out of the red
if the
superstition exhibit be not
lucrative he will have to start
auction off some of these gem

with all this bad publicity it be no
wonder he look like that

ian
be you okay

beauregard
i can not believe it
i
may have be the last one to see
he alive
he be with i just
yesterday when i get out the statue
of Mbwun

Mbwun

what be that

warrior deity of the Kothoga an
extinct south american tribe
dr
john Whittlesley lead an expedition
that find the only known
representation of Mbwun
the statue
be say to carry a curse
every member of Whittlesleys

i get the relic out yesterday to put
on display
beauregard be there
the crate have be broken into and
the content be strew about

making up for lose time

dr
green

you have a warrant to look at that

special agent Pendergast

forgive i
i guess i be snooping
what be this

an invention of mine
it be a
computer program design to
describe the characteristic of a
give species from a read of it

i call it the genetic sequence
Extrapolator

how do it work

with a analysis from a fossil
you can use this program to tell the
species and sex of the animal
whether it be nocturnal what it
eat how it hunted how big it
be
you be not here for a lesson in

no
i come to talk about dr
john
Whittlesley

somehow when all this happen
i
know it would come back to john
be
he really dead

maybe not

if he be alive he would have contact
i

you have time to talk

dr
Whittlesley be last see in
Belem venezuela a week after the
rest of he expedition disappeared
taxi driver drive he to the
harbor where he boarded a cargo
boat
that boat washed up in i
district
everyone on board be
killed

and john

disappear
he body be not among
the victim

i do not understand

the people killed be maul and
they brain be eat
just like
beauregard
one part of the brain
be extracted with surgical
precision
the hypothalamus and
thalamus to be exact

john could not have anything to do
with a horrible thing like that
he
be a fine man despite his
problem

you loved he

yes
once
we meet at columbia
john
hold the Cadwalader chair in
statistical paleontology when i be
a grad student there

you be going to be marry

how do you know that

i run an internet search on dr
Whittlesley
get a list of he
scholarly article and the
engagement announcement in the
time
i also find a record of you
restrain order

that be two year ago
john be
still in love with i
he would not leave i alone

you be afraid of he be not you

he be afraid of himself
he tried
suicide once
he be i will
manic
depressive
he have wild emotional
high and low
not a happy
affliction for a scientist
he would
be rever in we community
by
the end he be a joke

tell i about the last expedition
what be he looking for

legendary monster called Mbwun

monster

yes
he developed he own theory
that he called the calisto effect
it held that evolution be not always
gradual or driven by natural
selection
the environment would
sometimes because sudden and grotesque
change which could result in a
monster species
it make no sense
but he feel he have evidence that
Mbwun be such a monster living in
isolation on the tepui for thousands
of year

what happen

no one know
the Kothoga who live
on the tepui be cannibal

no
i be all right
i will not let this
affect i anymore
john would not get
help
he ego endanger the live
of other
he theory come first

what if Whittlesley arrive on the
tepui and no monster be there
be
he desperate enough to create one

i do not understand

something come up in autopsy
tonight
imbed in Beauregards
body we find a claw

i god
then it be an animal

i do not think so
i think we be
mean to think it be Mbwun
do
Whittlesleys monster have claw

i do not know
he send back a statue
that be suppose to be an exact
representation
but i have never see
it
it be in the exhibit

would you mind showing it to i

where would we find it

i be not sure
we should split up
you take that hall and i will take
this one

i will come relieve you myself

what the hell

McNitt

McNitt
cut the crap
i know it be
you
you be not scaring i
come on

McNitt here
i be outside the
exhibit
Alls quiet
but i do not
see doyle

he called a minute ago looking for
you
he start vacation tomorrow and
he wanted out
i said you be on
the way
he could split

well he be go

any sign of a greeneyed monster

nope


i have no idea the museum have a
complete collection of Piranesis
forum sketch

if you like they they be for sale
another day like yesterday and half
the collection will be on the block

i have read about the museum
financial trouble

we have be operating in the red for
year
that be the whole idea
behind the superstition exhibit
it
be design to pull people in
we have spent every penny we have on
advance publicity bet
everything on the open success
if we postpone at the last minute
no
i do not want to think about
that

we all love the museum
i come here
myself with i kid
we be trying to
work with you

i appreciate that

if the party go forward and
that be a big if
i have arranged for
a large police presence

do they have to wear uniform

yes

i do not want to scare people

i understand
but mr
cuthbert
we have get big problem
depend
on what we find today we may have
to shut you down

what do you make of it margo

it be not mammalian that be for sure
i think it be reptilian

that would jive with what we get
from the preliminary readout
here have a look

accord to this twentyfive
percent of the claw be
unidentifiable about a third be
homo sapien and the rest be
Hemidactylus Turcicus

what be that

turkish gecko i believe
lizard

lizard and human on the same
strand
impossible
the sample must
be contaminate

there be another possibility
lot
of repeat base pair could suggest
a high level of genetic damage

genetic damage

when be defective it often
uncontrollably replicate long
repeating sequence of the same base
pair
virus can damage
so can
radiation certain chemical
even
cancer
let we let the


sort it
out
i have to get start
this
will take several hour

we need someone to take we to the
secure storage area

try dr
frock
he be the curator of
plant biology
all the curator
have key
and he know every inch
of this museum
the rest of we still
get lost

thank you for taking the time to
help we with this dr
frock

happy to be useful
it be rare enough
these day
accord to security
beauregard put the Whittlesley
crate in storage area

how many storage area be there

they fill seven floor
we have the
large collection of mammal and
dinosaur in the world
just to give
you an idea there be more than
three million insect specimen
not
to mention amphibian reptile
bird anthropological artifact
meteorite mineral and gem
only
about five percent of the museum
collection be actually on display

this place be a maze

i be one of the few who know every
inch it now that john be go

do you mean dr
Whittlesley

yes
john make quite a study of the
whole museum
he have a copy of i
original plan

Osteo prep karl

i kind of art

they keep i company
get kinda
lonely sometimes

i favorite be the two camel

really
i be partial to the skunk

do you ever wonder where we get all
we skeleton
this be the
laboratory where animal carcass
be reduced to bone
what be cooking today don

zebra

man that be ripe

Dermestid beetle
the second method
of preparing a skeleton used in
natural history museum world wide
bug be clean and highly efficient
they will polish that fox off in no
time

want to have a look at a gorilla
brain
get one right here

thanks don
we be in a hurry
some
other time

this should be it
can you read the
number

holy shit

something tried to get into this
room

and failed
these door be solid
steel

this mean there must be an animal
loose in the museum

i would not be so sure

this must be the one that held the
statue
let we see what else be
inside

the lid of this crate be scratch
with claw mark just like the door

one silver overlay with another of

look
it be some kind of letter

may i see that

it be from john
those two arrow
be he insignia
it be addressed to
louis moriarty a patron who
finance he expedition

read it out loud

dear louis
tomorrow we go to the south
end of the tepui where we will be in
the great danger so i be sending
carlos back with the crate
you
always believe in i louis even
in the dark day
so it give i
great pleasure to tell you you
faith have be rewarded
we have make
an incredible find
i enclose a
representation of Mbwun
note the
exaggerate claw the reptilian
attribute the hint of bipedalia
it be beyond belief but this statue
be accurate
i know because i have
see the beast


do you hear that
i god
he say
that Mbwun be real

pardon i french but bull shit

this on top of the scratch
be not
it proof

i think the scratch be put there
to scare we
perhaps even lead we to
this note

you said john Whittlesley make a
study of you blueprint of the
museum

yes

be there any hide room or
staircase
place where someone
could hide

not really
just the subbasement

where be that

i do not know
it be wall over
no
one be down there in year

you said you have plan of the
museum
could we see they please

i know they be here somewhere
it be
a good thing we caught the mover in
time
they be nineteen century
blueprint from when the museum be
build
i remember the subbasement
be below the regular basement
linked to the city sewer
i only
know about it because it flood all
the way up to the museum during the
hurricane of
i lost so many
precious book

eureka
who say it do not pay to
be a pack rat
now please be careful
with these
when you be do i would
like they back

how big be the subbasement

apparently it be huge

i think i should come with you

we have not get time
you have to
meet with museum security so we can
make a decision about tonight

these plan indicate there be a
wall over entrance to the sub
basement right around here

the dog be picking up something
mr
Pendergast

what be this
dungeon

this huge police presence tonight
be not necessary lieutenant
you will
just scare people off
i can handle
the security behind scene with this
system
it be state of the art

the cop be nonnegotiable
Ippolito
why do not you just tell i
how this space station works

it be fool proof basically
i
design this whole thing myself
every valuable object in the museum
carry a small electronic chip
if
anything moved so much as an inch
we get an alarm pinpoint the
exact location of the attempt
theft

that be great if you be stopping a
burglar
not we goal here
be
there motion detector

in every exhibition room
the
museum divided into five cell
the reception and exhibit be in
cell five
we could arm the motion
detector in cell one to four then
seal the perimeter with we fire
door

that would leave one exit for
hundreds of people
you would be
violate every fire regulation on
the book
we will guard the perimeter
with i man and engage the motion
detector in the other cell
one
more question
i see a big hole
if
this entire thing be run by
computer what happen if the power
fail

you do not know much about computer
lieutenant
there be safeguard
build in
we have backup system
with redundancy
there be no way
these computer can fail

i can not help think there be
something that Pendergast
overlooked
if the scratch be
make by whatever killed beauregard
it want something that be in here

blow dart
seed pod
plant
press
pretty unimpressive stuff

let i see the plant press

what be it

i be not sure
as you know the
Kothoga live outside civilization
on the tepui for thousands of year
species flourish in isolation when
man and pollution render they
extinct
this could be one of the
last remain sample of an unknown
plant

whatever it be it must be common on
the tepui
john used it as pack
material

you be right

they be curiously fleshy

and they smell delicious

taste great

i would not put that in you mouth
until we do a chemical analysis
greg

i can handle that for you while
we be waiting on the



what about those seed pod
be they
from the same plant

margo these be not seed pod

what be they

they be egg

hard to read in this light
the ink
be so faded

the dog have lost the scent mr
Pendergast
maybe we should head
back

not yet
let we try the fork to the
left

this place give i the creep

they have get something

keep the light up
i can not see

shut they up

heel argo
hobbes
heel

they be going crazy
i need help

he be loose
argo

stop

holy mother what be that

smell godawful
like rotten meat

argo
come

quiet

no
hobbes

forget the dog
you two get back
here
do not point that gun at i

argo
hobbes

get back
now

you shoot i dog

i dog

he be coming right at i

let we get out of here

i be not going anywhere
not without
i dog

hobbes

get back

there be something out there
let we
go get it now
that be why we come
down here be not it

he be right
follow i

no way
i say we get help
lot
more gun

i be ordering you
cover i

we will cover you from here

look
it be hobbes
he be all right

come on
let we get back to the
other
we can not leave they alone

it be alright
i can tell by the way
the doge acting that whatever be
out there be go
what be this
place

not on the map
look like it
connect with the city sewer

we be coming back

identify yourself
who be there

oh
i
god

quiet

stay calm

i be telling you something wrong
i still have not hear from
Pendergast
i think you should call
it off

it be too late now
guest be
arriving
the mayor car be pulling
up

i will go down and speak to he

you have not get the authority
only
Pendergast can pull the plug

Pendergast may be in trouble
do not
you understand
he still have not come
back
it be be over three hour

he will be back
relax
we be in good
shape
you security be air tight
Thereve be no more incident
nothing suspicious
there be no
reason to call off the open now

what kind of egg be it

it be reptilian

like the claw

let we not jump to conclusion
this
egg could belong to any number of
reptile dr
frock

come on margo
we be on the verge
of something huge
let we consider
the possibility just the three of
we alone in this room
what if john
be right
i mean what if
and he
send back an egg of he monster in
the crate
when it get to the
museum it hatch

several problem with that theory
for one thing this egg be intact
for another accord to
Pendergast the crate be ship
here on a boat
everyone on board
be killed like beauregard
if the
thing hatch in midocean where
do it go

i guess you be not interest in
this plant anymore but the chemical
analysis be do
frock read the
computer over gregs shoulder

genus
unknown
family
unknown
order
unknown
phylum
unknown
cripes margo what do you give i
be this an animal or one funky
shrub

i see you have be programming the
computer vocabulary again

look at this
an ambyloid reovirus
protein
that explain why the
computer confuse
the plant
infected with a virus

that be not so unusual
many plant
carry virus
like the burls on
maple tree

but a virus normally code for other
virus
this one making human and
animal protein
listen to this
Glycotetraglycine collagenoid
Weinsteins tropic hormone

monoxytocin supressin hormone


these plant fiber be loaded with
hormone

what kind of hormone

monoxytocin be
hormone
secrete by the human hypothalamus
gland


try Weinsteins tropic hormone

hormone secrete by the human
thalamus gland

this be it
this be what he or
it
be after
the plant have high
concentration of the same hormone
find in minute quantity in the
human brain

so what

Pendergast told i the killer
extract and eat the hypothalamus
and thalamus of the victim brain

eat they

yes
whatever killed beauregard may
have live on this plant
when the
crate be put in secure storage
they be out of reach
the killer
could not get they so it get the
next good thing

Beauregards head

it be all right
that mean the



have finished analyze the
claw
greg you go find
Pendergast and lieutenant DAgosta
now

hey where za little boy room

down that hallway
but do not stay
long
you do not want to be here
alone

all right assuming the program be
accurate this be a description of
the animal with that claw
species unidentified
genus
unidentified
phylum unknown
male
weight in excess of kg
brain
capacity centimeters
that
mean it be highly intelligent
quadrupedal


quadrupedal
the other name for
Mbwun
he who walk on all fours


nocturnal
external hair and bony
plate
locomotor speed
kilometer
reduce optic chiasm
poor eyesight
external mucoid
nasal gland
very keen scent
morphological characteristic
highly robust
aggressiveness
extreme


so the claw come from a huge
creature with a preternatural sense
of smell and poor eyesight that
hunt at night

with the intelligence of a human
be the speed of a greyhound and
the strength of a grizzly bear

margo what you have just described be
a kill machine

and it be hungry
it be be two day
since it be eat
there be five
hundred people arriving right now
the animal hunt at night and it have
a keen sense of smell
all those
people in one enclose space

it be like ringing the dinner bell

thank you everyone and welcome
we be glad all of you be will
to brave the inclement weather to be
with we tonight
we special thank
to he honor the mayor and he
lovely wife

some people have question whether
a superstition exhibit belong in a
museum of science
spell
incantation demon magic
these
be force that defy the natural
law
superstition provide answer
to the great question base on
fear
science provide answer to
the great question base on truth
science and superstition then be
polar opposite
mortal enemy if
you will
and that be why we be
here tonight
we have come to learn
more about the enemy and thus to
bring about it defeat
for every
good there be an evil for every
dark a light
and so tonight
i
friend i give you ignorance
terror unreasoning fear pure evil
have a great time

we have to get out quickly before
the fire door fall

what door

i told you

coordinate with the fire department
and team
move

i do not know how to deal with this
it be hellish
like nothing i ever
see
i be not trained to deal with a
monster a supernatural creature
like that

it be not supernatural
Mbwun be an
animal
part lizard part human a
genetic freak of some kind like the
halfgoat halfsheep they find
last year in the jungle of vietnam

but this be not the jungle

new york
how do it get here

thing like that cross two
continent

the people
upstairs need we
we have to help

we can not
we have managed to get
inside the one place that be safe
i
think we should sit tight and wait
for reinforcement
if we go
outside we be risking more live
you have to accept it margo
there be nothing we can do
the
build must be swarm with
police by now
it will not take long
for they to get through the door

that thing could kill ten people in
a matter of minute

but what can we do
we gun be
useless

we have the fiber
do not you see
the creature be hungry
it want the
hormone in these plant
it would
take hundreds of human brain to
supply what be in these fiber
we be
just a poor substitute
to make it
stop hunting we have to give it
what it want

leave a trail back to and try
to trap the monster in here

margo this be too dangerous
you
