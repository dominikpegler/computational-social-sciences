bugler
prewitt i always make it a policy
to talk to i new man
it be
important for an officer and he
man to understand each other
now i
have a fine smoothrunning outfit

plenty of room for advancement for
a man who know how to soldier
but
he be get to show i he be get it on
the ball
i do not know what you have
be used to in the bugle corps
but in i outfit we run it by the
book
what kind of trouble be you
in over there


no trouble sir

what make you transfer out then

it be a personal matter air

oh
i see

something you wanted to ask
sergeant

who
i
Whv yes air
you have
Corprals stripe in the bugle
corps prewitt
you take a bust to
buck private to transfer to an
infantry Compny
why
because you
like to hike

i dint have no trouble if that be
what you mean

or be it just because you could not
stand to bugle

it be a personal matter

that be up to the Compny commander
discretion to decide

all right
i be first bugler at
Shafter for two year
the topkick
have a friend who transferred in
from the state
next day he make
he first bugler over i


and you ask out on account of
that

maybe i just be not sensible
but
that be the reason

he feeling be hurt
kid they
send we now

i have get a mighty sour company
bugler here
but i suppose you
would not want that job

no air

well we will get you stripe back
for you maybe an extra one for
good measure
you know why you be
send over here when you request
transfer

no sir

i pulled a few string
i be the
regimental boxing coach prewitt
i
see you fight with connors in the
bowl year before last
with any
luck you should have win it
i
think for a while in the second
round you be going to knock he
out

thank you sir


i regiment get beaten last year in
the final as you know
but i mean to win this year
and i
will
all i have needed be a top
middleweight
next year i will hang you picture up
there with the other i boy

i be sorry air
but i quit
fight

quit fighting
when
what for

i just stopped sir
after
maybe you hear about what
happen

you mean that fallow you hurt
the one that go blind


yes it be too bad about that
i can
understand how you feel
but those
thing happen in this game
man
have get to accept that possibility
when he fight

that be why i decided i would quit
sir

but on the other hand look at


it this way
what if all fighter
feel like that

they do not

would you have we disband we
fight program because one man
get hurt

no sir
i dint say

you might as well say stop war
because one man get killed
we
fight program be the good morale
builder we have off here away from
home

i do not want it disbanded sir
but i do not see why any man should
fight unless he want to

it look to i like you be trying
to acquire a reputation as a lone
wolf prewitt
you should know that
in the army it be not the individual
that count
if a man want to get
ahead he have certain
responsibility to fulfill that go
beyond the regulation
it might
look as though i be a free agent
but i be not
nobody be

maybe you will change you mind
in
the meantime just do not make any
mistake in i outfit

neither of we wear headgear
anyway
i be set flat on i foot
when i caught dixie wide with this
no more than ordinary solid cross
dixie just happen to be standing
solid too


from the way he fell i know
dead
weight square on he face
he dint
roll over
he be in a coma a week
then he finally come out of it
the
only thing be that he be blind
i go up to the hospital to see
he
twice
then i could not go
back
we get to talking about
fighting the second time
and dixie

Seein tear comin out of
those eye that could not see



nobody ever kiss i that way

out of all the many
man you have be kiss by

well that will take some figure
how many man do you think there

make i a rough estimate

not without an adding machine
do
you have you adding machine with
you

no i forget to bring it

then i guess you will not find out
will you

maybe i already know

what be the matter
what be you
hint at

why
be there something to hint at

i do not know
maybe a lot
or maybe
you just think there be a lot

maybe i do
maybe there be be a
long line of beach party


you must be crazy

be i
listen baby maybe not here
but what about when you and holmes
be at fort bliss

i have to go and forget you be a
man with the same rotten filthy
mind the rest of they have
for a
minute i have to convince myself you
be different

only it be true be not it

yes it be true
part of it some
small part of whatever sewage
you have be listening to
some day
perhaps you will get all the story

all what story

you be get to sound so much
like a typical male
so you just
sweat it out like a typical male

all right
i have never tell it to
anyone before
but i think now be
the time
i will tell you the whole
bloody messy thing
you can take it
back to the barracks with you

holmes two year

first lieutenant then

bliss

lake where we could fish and swim
and be alone we adream
cottage

able to picture it
it be off on a
back road four mile from the
highway
two mile from a neighbor
and a telephone
i have not be marry long when
i know i husband be step
out on i
but you get used
to that
you mother tell you
that it be life that i t happen
to a lot of woman
of course
she do not tell you until after
it happen

then by that time you be
pregnant
and at least you have
something else to hope for
i think
i be almost happy that night the
pain begin
even though they be
week too early a whole month too
early
i remember dana be putting
on that dapper silk gabardine
uniform he used to wear
he be
going to an officer seminar
he
be kidding i about false labor
i
do not think it be humorous
i
told he to get home early to
bring the doctor with he
he
smile tenderly and told i about
the psychic reaction of woman to
pregnancy
but never fear he would be
back early
and maybe he would
have
if the seminar have not
be with the hatcheck girl in one
of the night club


listen


he be only a little drink when he
come in
at five a
m

alarm when he see i
i guess it
be because of i scream
i be
lying there on the floor you see

finished yet
of course the baby
be dead
it be a boy

appendix out too
they threw that
in free
it be all fine

gut she will

what do she say

she said it be over time to go


home
beach a car a park

it will work out

it can not go on like this much
longer milt

i know

if there be only a way
you
lovin husband probly give you the
divorce
but even if he do not know
what for he would never let i
transfer

buck up courage

there be a way
i have be think
about it

you have get to become an officer

what


you be eligible for the extension
course that come in with the draft
when you get you commission they would
ship you back to the states new
officer be not keep at post where
they have be enlist man
then

you sure make a thorough study of
it

then i could divorce dana and
follow you and marry you

an officer
i have always hated
officer

that be a fine intelligent point
of view
suppose i said i have always
hate sergeant
that would make a
lot of sense would not it

okay suppose i do it
and
do not think it be a cinch the
exam be tough
then you would be
get you divorce here while i be
in the states
we would be apart maybe
six month
we will probly be in the
war by then


you can not be certain of that

put it down on you calendar
on
october twentythird milt
warden told you we would be in the war
in less than a year

why do not you tell the truth


you just do not want the
responsibility
you be probably not
even in love with i

you be crazy
i wish i be not in
love with you
maybe could enjoy
life again

i do not know what be happen to you
you be honest at first

at first
you be tough and solid
as a rock and now you be a
whining crybaby

and so they be marry and live
unhappily ever after

i have never be so miserable in i
life as i have since i meet you

neither have i

i would not trade a minute of it

neither would i

i will probably make the lousiest
officer they ever see in this army


you will make a fine officer

remarkable officer



i never caught on to dancing much

you be a very good dancer

i be wanting to tell you a long
time now
i love you

that be nice
because i love you
too



i mean it
i need you

i be glad
because i need you too

thirtyyear man be movin all
over goin all the time
up to now
i never think a thirtyyear man
have any business to think of gettin
marry

you be a funny one little Prew
boy

yeah
must be the altitude

very funny one that i cannot
figure out

why be it funny if a guy want to
marry you

because i be a girl you meet at the
new congress club
and that be about
two step up from the pavement

okay i be a private no class
dogface soljer
and the way most
civilian look at it that be two
step up from no thin

oh Prew Prew i think we be
happy
why do you want to spoil
thing


Lissen i be not think in of now
but i get a plan cookin in i head
you want to go back to the states
in a year
well you could stretch
it some make it two year
and i
could swing a sergeant stripe
if i be a noncom the Armyd let
i pick i duty when i reenlist
lost in the picture of

and there be some post back in the
state like jefferson barracks
the marry noncoms rate solid
brick house
with lawn with new
cut grass and walk with big old
oak tree

now i know you have lost you mind
how do you expect to become a
sergeant under this captain holmes
of yours
it be all you can do to
keep out of the stockade

i could fight


it i go out for boxin he would send i
to noncom school
the regimental
championship be next month
i bet i
could win the middleweight even
without train
i used to be
pretty good i could do it

no
i do not think you should give
in to the treatment
even to
marry i

Thisd be worth it











bitterly disappoint but



you get guts alma
i hope you pull
it off

but i do mean it when i say i need
you
because i be lonely
sometimes
i be dreadfully lonely
you think
i be lying do not you

no
nobody ever lie about be
lonely



i have known about it for a long
time
i have sense it
and i be not
going to ignore it any longer
i
want to know where you meet he and
just who he be

i be afraid i be not going to tell
you

you can not keep a thing like this


i be not going to hide anything
i be
just not going to tell you


one thing i know
i know it be a
civilian
you would be too discreet to
pick an army man

i do not think it be any of you
business who he be

it be i business
i be you
husband
what do you think a
scandal would do to i chance for
a promotion
so if you be think
of a divorce you can forget it

now how do it feel to know
you will have to live with a horror
like i the rest of you life

not very nice
but then there be the
compensation of knowing you will have
to live with i the rest of you
life

you do not know how a man feel
about a thing like this
it break
a man all up inside

i gander why man feel so
differently about it than woman

it be it be just not the same


why do you think i have do all i
have

do all what

try to be a company commander
when i hate it worked i fool head
off with this miserable box
squad tag after the general
whenever i could

i do not know
why

why for you and for i
for we
home that be why

i always think you do it because
you wanted to get ahead

it be a lovely day out
i think i will
go for a walk

i be will to forgive you
tell i
who he be
make a clean breast of
it
and i will forgive you

i wonder which be hurt more you
pride or you curiosity

when i be ready to ask you for a
divorce we can discuss it again


and do eat you breakfast dana
it be get cold


you just get out of the stockade

it be rugged sam
but i keep i
mouth shut and watch i step and
i be not in no trouble

in addition to inefficiency
in administer he command and
neglect of duty captain holmes have
be guilty of indefensible cruelty
to the aforesay private prewitt
this extended to instigate and
encouraging wholly unauthorized and
discreditable tactic to force the
soldier to join the interregiment
box team
these finding be the
result of personal investigation by
the inspector general and be
corroborate by numerous member of
company

i be waiting for you reply to this

i have not any sir
the charge
be true

holmes the first thing i ever
learned in the army be that an
officer take care of he man
it
seem to be the first thing you
forget
it be monstrous to think of
anybody like you in command of
troop
and believe i you will not
be for long
i only regret be that
we have to keep you in uniform
until a court martial be conclude


in the meantime of course i be
relieving you of you present
duty

if there be any way to avoid a
court martial sir
any way

there be one alternative
general
if you be so disposed

service under

i will give you a chance you do not
deserve holmes
write a letter of
resignation and have it on i desk
this afternoon
i will consider
accepting it
only because as far

you be out of the army the good
for everybody
