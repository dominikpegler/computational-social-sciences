cracking the clock and the speedometer
dial
the cabin be deform and
there be dust and glass and plastic
flake everywhere inside
the
carpete be damp and stink of blood
and other body and machine fluid

there
seem to be three time as many car
as there be before the accident

handling a car again might be more
tire than i imagine

you be not envious

maybe i be a little
james i have get to leave for the
office
be you going to be all right

i be sure the police would make an
exception in you case

there be still a patch of blood there
on the road
do you see it

i see the blood
it look like motor
oil

you be the last one i see just
before the accident
do you remember
we make love

be you still involve i in you
crash

who be that man
be he a private
detective

can you drive

i can drive

i can not believe you have do this

this be the exact same car as you
old one be not it

yes it be
be you planning to have another car
crash

i be not think about the crash at
all

after this sort of thing how do
people manage to look at a car let
alone drive one
i be trying to find Charless car

it be not here
maybe the police be
still holding it
they forensic
people

they said it be here
they told i
this morning

this be you car

you will tear you glove

i do not think we should have come
here
i be surprise the police do not
make it more difficult

be you badly hurt
i think we see
each other at the hospital
i do not want the car
in fact i be
appal to find that i have to pay
a small fee to have it scrapped

can i give you a lift
i somehow find myself driving again

you have not tell i where we be going

have not i
to the airport if you
could

the airport
why
be you leaving

not yet though not soon enough
for some people i have already find
death in the doctor family make
the patient doubly uneasy

i take it you be not wearing white
to reassure they

i will wear a bloody kimono if i want
to

so why the airport

i work in the immigration department
there

do you want a cigarette
i start
to smoke at the hospital
it be rather
stupid of i

look at all this traffic
i be not
sure i can deal with it

it be much bad now
you notice
that do you
the day i left the
hospital i have the extraordinary
feeling that all these car be
gathering for some special reason i
do not understand
there seem to
be ten time as much traffic

be we imagine it

you have buy yourself exactly the
same car again
it be the same shape
and colour

turn up here into the carpark
it
will not be busy this time of day

i have find that i enjoy bury myself
in heavy traffic
i like to look at
it
yesterday i hired a taxidriver
to drive i around for an hour
anywhere i said
we sit in a
massive traffic jam under an off
ramp
i do not think we moved more
than fifty yard
i be think of taking up a new job
with the road research laboratory
they need a medical officer
the
salary be large something i have
get to think about now
there be a
certain moral virtue in be
materialistic i be beginning to feel
well it be a new approach for i in
any case

the road research laboratory
where
they simulate car crash

yes

be not that rather too close

that be the point
besides i know i
can give something now that i be not
remotely aware of before
it be not a
matter of duty so much as of
commitment

i almost forget to give you this
probably because i know you be going
to like it

what be it

complimentary ticket for a special
stuntdriving exhibition
definitely
not part of the big auto show
there be
a map in the packet and a note
request you be discreet about the
location

really
what kind of exhibition be
it

i suspect it involve reenactments
of famous car crash
you know
jayne mansfield james dean albert
camus

you be kidding

serious
but you will have to take
you new friend the female crash
test dummy
she drop it off for
you

you be not jealous be you
you
have to understand
helen and i
have this strange intense
experience together

we have have a few of those ourselves
have not we

do not worry that guy get to see
we
these be the confident last
word of the brilliant young hollywood
star james dean as he pilote his
porsche spyder race car toward a
date with death on a lonely stretch
of california twolane blacktop
route
do not worry that guy
get to see we
the year
the
day september thirtieth
the time
now

it be strange i think all this
would be far more popular

the real thing be available free of
charge
besides it be not quite legal
they can not advertise

the first star of we show be little
bastard james deans racing porsche
he named it after himself and have
he race number painted on
it

who be that
the announcer
do i
know he

that be vaughan
he talk to you at
the hospital

oh yes
i think he be a medical
photographer do some sort of
accident research
he wanted every
conceivable detail about we crash

when i first meet vaughan he be a
specialist in international
computerize traffic system
i do not
know what he be now

the second star be stuntman and former
race driver colin seagrave who
will drive we replica of james deans
car

i myself shall play the role of james
deans race mechanic rolf
Wutherich send over from the porsche
factory in Zuffenhausen germany
this mechanic be himself fate to
die in a car crash in germany twenty
six year later
and the third and
in some way most important party
the college student donald Turnupseed
play by movie stuntman brett trask

Turnupseed be on he way back to
he home in fresno for the weekend
james dean be on he way to an
automobile race in salinas a dusty
town in northern california
the two
would only meet for one moment but
it be a moment that would create a
hollywood legend

you will notice that we be not wearing
helmet or safety padding of any
kind and we car be not equip
with roll cage or seatbelt
we
depend solely on the skill of we
driver for we safety so that we
can bring you the ultimate in
authenticity
all right here we go
the fatal crash of james dean

be that part of the act or be they
really hurt

i do not know
you can never be sure
with vaughan
this be he show

rolf Wutherich be throw from the
porsche and spent a year in the
hospital recover from he injury
donald Turnupseed be find wandering
around in a daze basically unhurt
james dean die of a break neck and
become immortal

hold i
i be dizzy
i can not stand
up

i know that man seagrave the stunt
driver
i think he be genuinely hurt

this be an illegal and unauthorized
automotive demonstration which be in
contravention of the highway traffic
act
you be all liable to fine and
possible arrest and confinement
disperse at once
disperse at once

what be the matter with seagrave

hit he head i think
he balance
be off

why be the police taking this all
so seriously

it be not the police
it be the
department of transport
internal
politics
it be a joke
they have no
idea who we really be

that be glib be not it
james
dean die of a break neck and become
immortal
but i could not resist

oh god
what happen
here lie
down

they do the james dean crash
it
seem to go perfectly
but he start
to feel nauseous on the way back
i be sure it be concussion

ah well
we be familiar enough
with that then be not we

i would really like to work out the
detail of the jayne mansfield crash
with you
we could do the decapitation
she head embedded in the windshield
and the little dead dog thing as
well
you know the chihuahua in
the back seat
i have get it figure
out

you know i will be ready vaughan
but
i will want to wear really big tit
out to here so the crowd can see
they get cut up and crushed on the
dashboard

do not leave yet ballard

colleague of mine then a trainee
radiologist then the service manager
at i garage

and you have sex with all of these
man in car
only in car

yes
i do not plan it that way

and do you fantasize that vaughan
be photograph all these sex act
as though they be traffic accident

yes
they feel like traffic accident

get all the paper you can ballard
some of the stuff they be giving
away be terrific
mechanism of
occupant ejection tolerance of
the human face in crash impact

we can have a look at it again on
the monitor
they be showing it in
slow motion

i have always wanted to drive a crash
car

you could get you wish at any moment

no i mean a crash with a history
Camuss Facel vega or nathaniel
wests station wagon grace kellys
rover
fix it just enough to
get it roll
do not clean it do not
touch anything else

be that why you drive this car
i
take it that you see kennedys
assassination as a special kind of
car crash

the case could be make

take a look at this and tell i what
you think

it be very
satisfy
i be not
sure i understand why

it be the future ballard and you be
already part of it
for the first
time a benevolent psychopathology
beckon towards we
for example the
car crash be a fertilizing rather
than a destructive event a
liberation of sexual energy that
mediate the sexuality of those who
have die with an intensity impossible
in any other form
to fully understand
that and to live that
that be i
project

what about the reshape of the human
body by modern technology
i think
that be you project

crude scifi concept that float
on the surface and do not threaten
anybody
i use it to test the
resilience of i potential partner
in psychopathology

you drive

let we get rid of that
i do not want
you blowing it up i urethra

you friend still out there

what do he want from you
