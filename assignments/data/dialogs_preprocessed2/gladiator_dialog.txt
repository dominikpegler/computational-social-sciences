hail warrior
i congratulations

highness

i old friend i father tell i
you be returning to spain

yes

pity
i will need man like you in
i army

there be large division that might
appeal to you
even the praetorian
guard
you have never be to rome
imagine arriving as head of the
Praetorians
they have really
splendid uniform

i be going home

and why not apply for entry to
the senate

war hero with a handsome face and
a strong heart could go far

general maximus may i present
senator gaius and falco
beware of
this gaius he will pour a honeyed
potion in you ear and you will wake
up one day and all you will say be
republic republic republic


have you never considered rome

no

you have have i ear since we be
child
you could be a valuable
ally in the senate

be you a believer in republicanism

there i warn you

i be a soldier not a politician

if you heart lie with the people
i would back you for the senate
i be sure Gracchus would as well

not a word about that sodomite
bastard

the august senator Gracchus have be
rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
imperial family

he be a damn provocateur

he life under the antiquated
assumption that the senate should
represent the people with vigor

i will not tolerate it
he incessant
criticism exhaust i
the man can
speak for five hour without taking
a breath

he serve rome best when he serve
it with honesty

enough
maximus i would like to
inspect the felix regiment at dawn
please arrange it

i can not do that

excuse i

i man have be fighting for five
solid day
they be too busy dying
to go on dress parade

of course how foolish of i
some
other time

caesar retire early tonight

if only you have be born a man

father

what a caesar you would have make

you be right

i think you would have be strong
i wonder if you would have be
just

i would have be what you taught i
to be

well pretend to be i love
daughter tonight and walk with i to
i chamber

this be a pleasant fiction be not
it

caesar

read this

i never acquired the art sir

of course
no matter
in this
letter i denote i intention to
nominate you to stand for the
emperorship after i death

i son be not a moral man
you have
known this since you be young
he
cannot rule

caesar i be honore but

for twenty year i have be
spill blood
for twenty year i
have written philosophy and
ruminate and conquer
since i
become caesar i have only have four
year without war
four year of
peace in twenty
so perhaps i can
be
forgive

while i have be fighting rome have
grow mad and corpulent and
diseased
i do this
and now i
shall make it right

sire you bring the light of the
god to barbarian darkness
you
bring civilization and justice to
the far

i have bring the sword nothing
more
rome be far away and we
should not be here
what matter be
it to the god if we subdue one more
tribe of parthian or gaul
what
matter be it to rome if a thousand
more barbarian bend to we lash

winter maximus
it be winter now

there be a dream that be rome
i
can only whisper of it now
anything more than a whisper and the
dream vanish
it be so
fragile
the true glory of rome be in a very
fragile idea
imagine a place
devote to the right of the
citizen
where every free man have a
voice
that be the dream
and i
fear it will not survive the winter

let we just whisper here you and i

yes caesar

if the dream be ever to live again
the people must have a true voice
the voice i take from they
that
all the caesars take from they bit
by bit conquest by conquest
and
now that i be die i be going to
give they that voice again

you be not die

i be maximus
it be strange
i
find as i near the end i think
little of the wane moment around
i
instead i think much of the
past
and of the future
how will
the world speak i name in year to
come
will i be known as the
philosopher
the warrior
the
tyrant
or will there be a more
golden sound to i name
will i
be the emperor who give rome back
she freedom

before i die i will give the people
this final gift
i will give they
the senate reborn
the voice of the
people empowered again as it be
always mean to be
it be i design
that they will elect the next
emperor
and i would put forward
you name with i back

caesar you do i honor but you
son have pride of place for
succession

you be the son i should have have
although i fear in i deep heart
that if you have truly be i son i
blood would have polluted you as it
do commodus
we be a curse
bloodline
we have live so long in
power and depravity that we no
longer remember a life without it
we can no longer even imagine a life
without it

look at i son

son
i know that one grove of you
vineyard be worth more to you than
all the treasure of rome
i know
one love word from you wife be
worth more than the accolade of an
empire
but
a fond old man who
love you more than he can say beg
you to at least think about what he
have say tonight

i shall caesar

i will keep this letter to myself
i
hope that with the sunrise you will
agree
and embrace i as a father

you have always be i father

he always favore you

even over he son

that be not true

maximus stop
let i see you face

you have be crying

i lost too many man

what do i father intend

i do not know

you be lying
i could tell when you
be lying even when we be
child
you hate it

i never acquired you comfort with
it

true
but then you never have to
maximus stop
be it really so terrible seeing
i again

no
i be sorry
i be tire from the
battle

and you be hurt to see i father
die

he will announce commodus
succession
that be why he summon
we
will you serve i brother as
you serve he father

i will always serve the ideal of
rome

do you know i still remember you in
i prayer
oh yes i pray
ever since that day you saved i
from drowning off capri
do you
remember

yes

commodus be so angry that a mere
peasant a spaniard no less
touched the royal person do you
remember he anger

yes

mark this maximus
that be the man
who will be emperor

may i be permitted to go highness

there be a time when you do not
call i highness


and there be a time when you be
just a little girl drowning in the
sea
all that be a different life

very different
i wonder if it be
well

it be more honest

i thank you for you prayer

ancestor true bloodline i ask you
for you guidance
bring i you
solace and you wisdom
blessed
mother come to i in i dream with
the god desire for i future
blessed father watch over i wife
and i son with a ready sword
keep

to they in they sleep that i live
only to hold they again and all else

bloodline i honor you and will try
to live with the dignity you have
taught i

i search the face of the god for
way to please you
to make you

axmen
if you get all four there be
an extra bonus so do not be

butterfly a woman a boy and gold

way

of the sea and leave all the
politics to you

caesar be
please to bring you



the crowd be going
mad



god
that old homicide
the
emperor must truly hate you

what can you tell i

he cheat

and from the rocky promontory and
martial bloodline of spain
representing the train lyceum of
Proximo antoninus
i give you


we who be about to die salute you

be it true you be a general

i be a general

i see you fight
the carthage
battle too
i have never see so much
courage

it do not take courage to kill

i father be killed

i be sorry

he still come to i in i dream
do you have a father

i have a father
he be not really i
father but i care for he very much

i hope he come to you in you
dream
i father and i ride horse
in mine

lucius run along now
i need to
talk to the general

where be i army

maximus will summon he army
from ostia and he will strike from
the inside as he army strike from
the outside
but he insist that
the senate be present

we have be ordered to attend

how many be with we

about half
but once the tyrant be
dead
all

i want to meet he

i will arrange it

and what of the emperor

he have withdraw
he be not eating
he do not go out
he will not even
see i
i do not know what tempest
rage within he but

we should fear for the black
storm

yes

one question
who be to be the
actual regicide

you do not kill he

i will not kill another warrior
there be no honor to it

maximus the merciful
maximus the
merciful

tell he we will enter rome on the
first day of commodus festival

and they will march on rome for you

yes
but this letter must go to the
lieutenant named titus no one else

captain marcellus will take it
and
he city guard will by with you when
you get to rome
be that enough to
face the praetorian guard

the felix regiment will never be
defeated

i only have one question for you
general
why

you will lead an army of you
brother on rome
many will die
why

i want commodus dead

that be not the reason
tell i the
truth

because one night an old man
whispered to i about a dream
i
will die for that dream

i know the old man well
and i
loved he very much
in we youth
we would spend hour building that
dream together
after he go to
the war and lost he way
i be
very cruel
i tormented he to
remember that dream we speak of

he do

you can have no idea how much that
mean to i

any man who will die for a whisper
dream deserve i respect
i honor
you general

madame the emperor would like to
see you

caesar

i be sorry to have keep you away
i needed this time to think

of course

i limit i world to these four
wall so as to let i mind free
again and again i mind settle on
but one question
what kind of
world be we making when the people
of rome prefer a slave in the arena
to they father

it be i responsibility to make the
world as it should be
how be it i
have make this world

brother do not be influence by the
mob
they be a great faceless
beast

they be not the mob Lucilla
they be the people
they be i
child and all i want to do be
love they

we father loved maximus
and i
love he still
yet he defy i
he task i in front of i child
and they love he for it
just as
marcus loved he for it
tell i
why Lucilla

they see themselves in he
they
throw in they own sad dream
alongside he
they think he fight
for they

and what do i do but fight for
they
i give they game to please
they
i strangle dissent to give
they peace
i empower the
Praetorians to give they order
what more can i do

say i should fight he in the
arena
let i child see who the
god truly favor

and what if he should win

god be more powerful than a man

caesar you let this unduly worry
you
at good he be a pass fancy
he be a name an image on a
banner ephemeral he will be
forgotten as the next fancy
appear

but i need to know why do they
love he

mercy

he will not kill in the arena
he
be merciful
as they all wish they
be in they own heart

and for that moment in the arena
they be merciful too
for a
moment
they be god
offering
life

but who can be more merciful than
the emperor of rome

brother
we have taken a sad path
since we be child at capri
have we not

for i own part
i be sorry it
come to this
and to you alone of
all man i acknowledge i error
and i regret
i shall live with i
sin for all i day

as will i commodus
as will i

as the first act of i contrition i
offer you the wooden sword of
freedom

take it brother
stand at i side
as a free man worthy of you
ancestor

i only have ancestor because of
you brother
you killed everything
that ever live alongside i

take it maximus
let we heal that
fatal wound together

this be the new home you cursed i
to
and i be safer here from you
treachery than i could ever be
outside

will you always mistrust i

why do not you ask you father that

i have more power as a slave in the
arena than i could ever have as a
free man
as the colosseum go
the people go
as the people go
the empire go

you think this be power
i could
show you power slave

no caesar
i will show you

the felix regiment will come from
here
we will face the body of the
Praetorians outside here
once
inside i archers will take up
position to counter opposition
inside the colosseum
i will enter
and join you we will attack here

a covert assault from within

we will be killed

probably

but if we be not
think of the
glory
do you remember glory
gladiator

and if we die that day we die
free man worthy of we ancestor

you do not know i ancestor

rotten bunch

then be worthy of he
the old
titan who would rather die bravely
in a just battle than slink off to
grow old and fat

and impotent

i funeral
