now
for a list of thing you can
put in i mouth


conners and dekker confer with teddy and vincent

do you remember who headed up the
pacific saving case

i think it be Callo
why

no reason
just think out loud

conners and dekker head back to the police station
it be
quiet between these two until

when you said it be you family
business i do not think

think


small cold room with a large mirror along the
gina sit at the table shivering
she breath visible so
be she nipple through a


conners pace around she like a
Dekkers in
the corner observe

she be telling the truth
conners wrap he coat around Ginas shoulder

i think for the first time in that
girl life she be telling the truth

you have to know once she ask for a
lawyer anything she told we would have
be inadmissable

who would have known
it would have be
i word against hers
who do you think
the jury would have believe

justice by any means
even if you
cross the line

the only line around here be the blue
linea you cross that one then you get

problem
ask Callo he know what i be
talking about
teddy enter hand conners a sheet of paper with

scribble on it

those serial number marnie fax i
accord to we computer that money
should be downstairs


occupy almost the entire basement of the police station

protect the content

conners and dekker wait
no one working at present
dekker peer inside anxiously looking for someone
dekker the service bell

dekker and conners proceed inside
they walk
scan the shelf checking the number

that fat fuck be the sole guardian of
the city big source of
contraband
drug
weapon
cash


all total about million or so
just sitting here for the take

you would have to have some major
firepower not to mention an extra
large set of ball to try and knock off
a police station

not if you be a cop
you could just
walk right in and

take whatever you want
shit


here be it
line seventeen

bernie Callo

like i said
no one take anything
out of here unless they sign for it

so what
he show you a warrant
what

he must have

you do not remember

you know how many time someone sign
shit in and out
i see the same guy
all the time
i can not remember one
instance two week ago
but if he
signature there that mean he signed
for it
take it up with he


jenkins listen as conners and crew brief the situation

the money from Richardss place trace
back to the pacific saving heist a few
month ago a case Callo headed up

Callo signed the money out of evidence
two week ago

how much



if it be Callo it would explain how
they know police protocol and how we
department operate

also explain why he be so pissed this
morning about be replace by
conners
he wanted to be the point so
everything go accord to plan

he do not need another reason to be
pissed at i

what about motive
do we have one

pressure might have be get to he
he be be get the cold shoulder
from cop since he testify about
pearl street bridge

he be also get divorce
this be news to everyone

about a month ago he told i he and
he wife might be split
ask if
i know a lawyer who would not clean he
out
i do not think it be this bad

bernie Callo be a first rate cop

boy scout

sense

they never do captain

do not act like you be not enjoy
this conners
i know what you think
of he

do not matter what i think

s sit in the kitchen
police encircle
she
in the center of the live room

a bullet wind right between the eye
and muddle through
every nook and cranny of the tiny home
conners teddy and
dekker be lead around by a

wife come home approximately fortyfive
minute ago
find he here
none of
the neighbor hear anything
there be
no force entry and no one see anyone
fleeing the scene
vincent enter from the basement carrying a

blueprint from the bank schematics
picture
also about a dozen
internet article on the saudi prince

dekker lean back against the car conners approach

what they told Callo be the plan and what
the plan really be may be two different
thing
clearly this be not part of a plan
Callo would have agreed with

you would think a cop would be smart

as cop we come across every temptation
in the book
money drug power
we would all like to think we can resist
any urge but
we be not saint

the buddha be troubled so he go back
to where he come from the begin
to find the path the answer

detective
go home

you have something you want to say


no captain
she said it perfectly


detective galloway could you give we a
comment

we just wanted a statement

shame on you

this be more than just news for we
american national sit on the
board of channel two
they have a
vest interest in what be going on

find another source

conners be right
we should have never
go in
how many more mistake can we
make in one day
he be eliminate
he accomplice
we think he be
going to show up
we do not even think
he could do this
how dumb be we



detective


i know what they be do inside the
bank

dax flip through the huge document

these be today transaction record
from the bank
an average day produce
about page give or take
today
there be over page

mean

we have just witness the large heist
in history
somewhere in the
neighborhood of a billion dollar

come again

it be a computer virus
the computer
virus
it randomly withdraw money
from all the account and deposit it
into the bad guy account
if you
check the transaction no two
withdrawal amount be the same and
none of be over
most
security system work on the size of
the money not number of transaction
wire out one million from a handful of
account and red flag go up
wire out
a less than a hundred from ten million
account no flag

where be the money now

i tried following one of the
transaction
it take i an hour and
when i finally have it
it go away

how be that possible

the virus created a host of phantom
account where the money go


temporarily then transfer to another
account then to another
it be never
in one place long enough to get an
accurate fix

it be still moving the money around

yeah
any deposit or withdrawal from
any bank do not usually go into affect
until the next business day
so it be
going to keep jumping around until it
clear at tomorrow

or pacific time
sunrise
so why
break in
if they be just wiring
money
could not they do that from
anywhere

that be the regional manager computer
terminal
there be no outsideremote
access to it
there you have unlimited
entry to the bank mainframe
no
password to work around no hacking
in
it be all nice and clean

billion dollar be miss and we be
only discover this now

ironically when the power go out it
helped hide the virus and buy it
time to work

so they be not trying to make it look
like they be rob a bank to rip
off a saudi prince
they be making
it look like they ripped off a saudi
prince to rob a bank
the chaos theory

you
can not always predict how it be all going
to play out
random camera catch
an image of richards the scent on the

they do not
make the commitment
i will not make that
same mistake

you said they be all hood

about Callo

Callo deserved he fate
it be he fault

this be Callos fault

if it be not for he york and i

evil be one smart sonofabitch
the
feds will be tracing false lead for

target

everybody who screw we get screw

all you year of service for not
you be a hypocrite

i be an opportunist
i would have gladly
die in the line of duty but they take
