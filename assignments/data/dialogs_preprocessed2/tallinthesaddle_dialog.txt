funny way of do thing

well i be sorry mr
Rocklin that
you have be bring all this way on
a fool errand but i be afraid
the deal off

off

i do not want to be too hard on you
but as executor of the estate i have
to consider the interest of the new
owner
how about say a hundred in
full settlement

well

that be i last word think it over

how do you do lady

you be judge garvey i presume

some sort of a letter from the late
mr
caldwell engaging he as foreman
of the



what

what do you mean claim to have

you see it do not you

before garvey can
answer
you can not hold we to account for
every promise make by that man
everyone know he be not responsible
for he action half the time
and
if you think i would have you as a foreman

find it hard to
control himself
listen lady i would rather walk for
somebody else than ride for you

well the impudence

all i come for this morning be to
pay beck the hundred and fifty red
caldwell send in advance

oh no

i be desperately in need of help and
advice from someone whom i feel i
can trust and i be appealing to
you because i regard you in the
same way i uncle surely must have
i heartily dislike and distrust judge
garvey

huh smart girl

but i aunt seem to have suddenly
revised she opinion of he and now
want i to place all i affair in
the judge hand and return east
such be certainly not i wish

look kinda like she be form an
attachment

for the locality i mean

i wanted so much to give ranch life
a trial but fear circumstance be
against i especially in view of
the recent indian trouble

indian trouble

trouble around here in

you want to hear the rest of this

might well come this far

Baaa Wimmen who can ever figure
they
get to admit though i feel a mite
sorry for the young nice little
tyke

too nice for this country

she be shore a pretty thing

do not know how i could help she
even if i wanted to i do not know
any thing about this garvey or
caldwell or

tell you something about ole red
that might be interestin

you must have known he pretty well
what kind of a man be he

caldwell
the best cantankerous
cuss but a real cowman believe
i he be a big feller like
yourself fact you coulda passed
fer a blood relation come to think
of it

casually as he busy
himself with the
biscuit
be the judge and red friend

that be what you would say
garvey manage
all red business
besides which
they be regular drinkin pal
play poker together most night
thoo they do say red get the bad
of it

red be a gambler eh

oh yeah reckon a pretty poor
one thoo still you would say he and
garvey be friend

after a side glance
to dave
anything ever happen to make you
think they be not

rock i be going to tell you something
i be not never tell anybody

think you can trust i

the last time i see red be the day
he die

Twas in town he jus come out
of the stage office

passage to garden city but could not
on account i have a full load

card and this paper in a coat one
of he friend loan he one night

jus decided to keep i mouth shut
and i eye open

even if it be garvey red be talkin
about it do not follow that he

no general opinion be that it be
rustler

why would rustler take the evidence

killer

it be he then

i be figgerin
do not seem
reasonable clew be in condition to
take that sort of chance alone
besides how could he have known i
be up there that soon
and
george clews be not the only one i have
run contrariwise to in this town
there be that mexican for instance

juan

he as good as tell i yesterday that
he and i be due for a runin one
of those day
suddenly nodding
toward window
and then there be he

i just hear that that Rocklin
be

be what

be shoot at last night

mr
Rocklin be just telling i all
about it
any idea who might have do it

not i

you be not trying to pin it on i
because if you be you be in for a
big disappointment
i be over at
the SunUp playing poker with the
judge and the rest of the boy till
early morning
if you do not believe
i ask for yourself

all right
i believe you
but that
do not mean you could not tell a thing
or two as would help if you wanted

what you mean

yes
what sort of thing would clint
here know about that would help
identify the man who tried to kill
you last night

this for one

ever see it before

well go on speak up
do you
ever see it before

avoiding Haroldays
eye
no
course i do not
suddenly raging at
Rocklin
quit riding i
i do not know nothing
about it i tell you
jest because i
have a runin with you over a game o
card that do not mean i would sneak up
on you in the dark and

he mean trouble

aw what do i care

turning on he with
cold fury
listen i never do have much use
for you
you be a poor specimen at
the good
but as a wouldbe bad man
you be nothing but a laugh stock
why the way you lie about that
pouch just now would not have deceive
a sixyear old

i

all right let it go at that
but i
get myself to think of
it would not
suit i at all just now to have you
show up in public for what you be
by that troubleshootin cowhand
i
advice to you be to get out of the
district and stay out
taking a key from
he vest pocket
you will find some money in the safe
at the ranch
take what you need and
put the key in the desk drawer
now
get

oh mr
Rocklin

i be so glad i have find you i be
on i way to the Santee and learned
you be in town

putting he saddle
etc
aside
just get in

i feel perfectly awful running after
you like this but

you get trouble eh

i aunt find out i write you and
make a terrible scene

you have not signed everything over
to that garvey have you

no and because i refused auntie
said she would sign an affidavit
that i be still underage and then
as i guardian she can do what she
like

get anything to prove you be not
underage

no but mr
garvey have a letter
that would prove it
i aunt write
it before we come out here

pose we could get it

he would never give it to i

wait here

with a slight start
toward Rocklin
oh please you
she hesitate not
quite sure what to
say
you will not go get yourself in
trouble i i would rather give up
everything i mean


that take care of that
now i will draw up an affidavit right
away and everything will be taken
care of as we want it

i certainly hope so it be not myself
i be concern about

of course not

i can not say i be very happy about
do this i only hope it work
out for the good

it be the good choice of two evil
now let we see
i elizabeth
it be elizabeth be not it

yes

elizabeth martin of danvers
massachusetts do hereby

leaning back in his
chair
well mr
Rocklin this be indeed a
surprise
do not expect to see you
so soon
i understood you be riding
for the Santee

that be right

perhaps you would well come back later

i come for that letter

do you say letter

that be right the one miss
caldwells aunt write from out east
sayin she be of age
remember

no i be afraid i do not

you realize what this be do not you

rob arm robbery at that

i warn you you be in for a
disappointment

open up

listen you
suddenly control
himself
there be nothing in there that would
interest you

i would like to make up i own mind about
that

all right i will open it just to
convince you i be not hide any
letter

what be the idea

these card

attempting to bluff
it out
anything wrong in a man have card
in he possession

depend on what kind they be
especially when they be under lock
and key

you be taking those i presume

that be right

now you look here

you be the one who well start
lookin lookin for a way out for
killin red caldwell

caldwell

take up one of the
deck of card
he find out about these and you
go and killed he

with an affect
smile and unnatural
calmness
and you believe a story like that

put deck he hold
in he pocket
i will just take this along the
district judge at garden city should
be mighty interest

the SunUp and do not take no for an
answer

you know
you can not get away with a yarn like
that
why do not you save yourself
and everyone else a lot of trouble
by surrender to the sheriff

he probably lost he head and pulled
a gun on you like he do at the sun
up that night
