we be thirty five thousand foot up

yes sir that be a problem but if
we can somehow get to a low
altitude the rear load ramp on
the baggage deck be equip with
parachute in case of an engine
failure
now we can either wait for
a political resolution or try to
resolve this thing ourselves

you be goddamn right we can resolve
this ourselves
we will negotiate

you know the president policy

the president be not here

right now we be an enormous liability
to the united states
we can not just
sit and do nothing

standing guard facing the opposite
direction

proceed

the chief of staff the first
lady and the first daughter
we
demand be simple
arrange the
release of ivan Stravanvitch
once
we leader be return to Turkuenistan
soil air force one and it be occupant
will be allow safe passage to
switzerland
you have one hour before
we start killing hostage



find that voice for i i want to
know who we be dealing with
and get
president petrov on the phone

madame VicePresident we just get
word from ramstein
the nod be
until chandler stand



empty

the president
he must still be
onboard



play back that call

yes sir



the plane be under we command and
those we do not kill we hold as
hostage including the chief of
staff the first lady and the first
daughter



but not the president
not the
president

he be dead then
they must have killed
he

we do not know that

holding the president hostage be not
something that slip you mind when
you be making demand



and if he be dead
do you really think
they would risk telling we

there be a possibility we be
overlook

when i run Specops in nam i ordered
the destruction of a

munition
dump
during insertion the plane
be shoot down and the entire team
be killed or so we think
two
day later the dump

walter if you have a point make
it

that kid name be jim marshall



so what be you saying

maybe he be alive on that plane and
those bastard do not even know it

president be not anymore

Goddamnit

serge

the NRAll love this

i understand you dilemma vice
president chandler
but unless you
can confirm that you president be
indeed a hostage i cannot release
Stravanavitch
if marshall be dead
no good will come of meeting this
demand
we both know he would agree


be not a first lady if she
husband be killed
then she be a
civilian
and i can not release he
for a civilian
do you see i point

madame vice president
we have an
option paper
chandler take the
option paper wave off lee and
read it as she talk



yes
you have make yourself quite clear



but i will deploy force to a stage
area near the turkmenistan border
when you have more information we
can decide how to proceed



by then i will be president



i do not like any of these
from do
you brief general northwood



can we do that

we have get four hour before they
make it into Turkienistan airspace



but they start execute hostage in

i hate to be pragmatic but they will
sacrifice pawn before king
it may
take they some time to kill they
way up to senior staff



okay
also i want you to put we
base in turkey on alert and have
the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory
air strike



i have not discount you theory hr

no
i get the new number from we
gamer
they believe that there be
only an eight percent chance that
the president be still alive



eight percent be good than zero

that be trouble



would someone get the press secretary

he be be holding on line four

who do this

we checked the manifest
everyone
be account for

secret service agent
it must be

there be no turning back

we can not jump from here or at this
speed
but if we could get a message

you must forgive the tape but we
be starting to feel outnumber

special agent gibbs
you helped do

because it be i duty

you be duty to what
the country you

i loyalty be never to i country

you do not think the leader of the
would allow peristroika to ruin
year of infiltration
no when the
soviet union collapsed we take we
sleeper with we

now since we have have very little luck
get washington or moscow to
cooperate i wonder if you would
be so kind

will start with you family instead
gibbs

the world be such a dangerous place

this be
between you and i

call up petrov and order
Stravanavitch release

this administration do not negotiate
with terrorist

pity
mr
gibbs

perhaps a president do not
negotiate but do a father
an interesting choice
you daughter
versus you world vision
the implicit
trust of a family against you oath
of office

daddy

alice
i

and once the trigger be pull she
be go forever

late at night when you think about
she will Stravanavitch really matter
anymore
