i have it on
good authority that the queen no longer
bleed yet the matter of a male heir
be still not resolved
a beat
it cannot be long before the king be
forced to look outside the marriage


what
and make a bastard king of
england

legitimize bastard
what choice do
he have
obviously i have given it think and
wonder which howard girl i could put
under he nose
imagine the influence
that would give we
to be blood family
of the next king of england
equally
imagine if another family be to
achieve the same
indicate in the corner and he two
loathsome ambitious son and

what about anne
turn and indicate across the crowd who be
dancing with

i realise as a boleyn she be not
officially a howard but as you
sister daughter

but she be you eldest thomas
you
first born
and you favourite
would not
you prefer she to have a nice
uncomplicated respectable marriage
like mary

if anne be an uncomplicated
respectable girl like mary then i would say
yes
but she be not
look out at

she be anything but



and stand in a corner watch the
party continue
elizabeths face darken

do not like it
it would cost a fortune
to make we house fit for a royal visit
money we do not have

and what if theDY
king do not like she
or if she sleep with he but give he
a girl

and what if you be to look on the
bright side
just once
an ominous clap of thunder outside

risk nothing you gain nothing

hen be it that people stopped think
of ambition as a sin and start
think of it as a virtue

easy for you to say
you have have power
and wealth all you life

until i married you thomas
and i be
happy to give it up
turn and walk back inside



knock on the door of she father study
she wait
presently the door open
we see inside

night
brush she sister hair
rub oil in she skin

o the king himself be coming to
hever
i be so happy for george

yes
but father take i aside
it seem
he have ambition for i too


he think i be ANNEcoage dnow
and of not
of an nt
unpleasing appearance

what
what be you saying

it be known the king have a wander eye
imagine
if he be to like i

but
you could never be more than he
mistress
and that be no substitute for a
husband

but as the kings mistress the least i would
get after he finished with i would be
an earl
and if i fell pregnant
and
give he what he wife have failed to
a beat
quite apart from the money it would be a
duke at least

but what about you happiness
you
future

i could be a happy duchess


be you nervous

little

you will tell i everything in the
morning

i promise

no detail spare
the door open and appear in the doorway

curtsey give a last good luck kiss then go
stare at she husband

hold i a moment
envelop with he arm

i be so lucky to have a man who be
content with what he have
look at he

you be be not you
smile look at he gorgeous bride

i be the lucky man in the world
reach for the wine

drink
shake she head
but tenderly insist

you should
it will hurt less
nervously drink

lie back
lie down
then she lift up she nightdress
pull
down he trousers
extend she hand
invite he to join she
slowly
lower himself on top of she
he enter she
smile in anticipation of pleasure
side to she one
might not have imagined
but one or two stroke later and william knuckle whiten his
face redden then he cry out and slump on top of she
look up
surely that be not it

thank you

aybe this be how it be mean to be








there he be

you think he will like i

of course sister
how could he not


you majesty you be most welcome

sir thomas
kiss hand
lady elizabeth

and we daughter anne

around we modest house

pleasure


here be the library

charming

and through here the observatory

lovely






what be that

falcon you grace

i can see that
but what be it do
there
more to the point
not just there but in every corner in
the house

i have no idea
ask i father
a beat
perhaps because falcon be vaguely
associative with field sport field
sport with aristocracy and in the
absence of a genuine coat of arm
a man with ambition will do the
strange thing

that be a sharp tongue you have
a beat
i wonder what it might say about i
behind i back

oh he majesty have nothing to fear from
i
unless he fear an excess of
compliment

really
and what would they be

we be a provincial outpost lagging far

resently she emerge from the bathroom
Whitefaced

still shut






now open

there be more
thanks to you i be to
become an earl
you brother a viscount
smile at who be eye widen

in addition we have received a number
of new grant and estate
pointedly to

so we debt be paid off

just be aware
these gift this
favour can go as swiftly as it come
these room belong to the duke of
buckingham
once the king closest
friend
now he head rot on a spike

because he committed treason

but what be treason
it be anything the
king or he lawyer decide it to be
anything that offend he or cause he
displeasure
a beat
and can you assure i we will never do
that

pay she no heed




happily the baby live
she be not
miscarry

but the placenta be weak
for the sake
of the child

she must begin she lyingin immediately

what

but i be only three month

with soothing biblical image be hung on the wall





ou poor girl
all alone in here
but
the time will fly by

will it
it be six month

i know
but the most important thing be
a healthy child
take marys hand

i will come and see you as often as i can
i promise
kiss then go

he have several of she pretty

mong the be and he
they

or the moment


for the moment he be still visiting mary
but for how long
the queen will soon
have he head spinning with pretty
little spanish thing
not to mention
the seymours with that girl of theirs

what we need be someone from family
who will keep the king focused on mary
remind he of she while she be
absent

what
speak

it be just
i be going to suggest anne

you could not control that girl last
time
what make you think it would be
any different now

i have have favourable report from the
dowager queen in france
it seem she be
quite changed



why

i suppose they feel three year of exile
be punishment enough

but the king visit i every day
there be no need for she
or anyone else

they just want to protect you
leave
nothing to chance

but in who be interest do they imagine
anne will act
certainly not mine

why they make this room such a
dungeon
do it really need to be this
dark

do not worry
she be have three year to
forgive you
and she be not going to risk
be send away again
she will do as
she be tell i be sure
besides the most important thing be

the three of we will be together again


alf a dozen among they a riding side





look up then return to he conversation
resently a third roar of laughter at the other end
this time

what be the noise
i can hardly hear
myself think

it be mistress boleyn you majesty
she
story about life at the french court
they be particularly amuse

i be only aware of one boleyn girl and
she be lyingin with a certain child in
she belly





get to he foot

it be i elder daughter anne you
majesty
she have return to court

what
that awful girl thomas
the one
that almost killed i
you allowed she back

the time abroad have do she good you
majesty
i be certain you would find she much
improve

really
look down the table

well come on
where be you other
boleyn girl
show you face
slowly get to she foot
look up
when he see
annes face he face fall
be a woman transformed
go be the simple clothes puppy
fat and lack of confidence
have become a glorious headturning siren
dressed in
dare french clothes
er hood be halfcrescent and reveal the hair
she neckline
plunge sexily
she sleeve be long and loose offer dare
flash of arm and elbow
like every other redblooded in the room be utterly
mesmerise
speechless

so
what be so amuse anne
perhaps we
might hear and judge for ourselves
dark intelligent eye stare back at
suddenly all
sound fade and the world shrink around they
it be as though
they be the only two people in the room

i be just giving i thought on the new
french king

which be





that for someone with such great wealth
and power
he have surprisingly little
authority as a man

hah

and be consume by one particular
rivalry he can barely think

eally
and who be this rival

neighbouring king who be name one be
forbid to mention at court
whose
reputation haunt he in he thought
and dream
ipples of laughter as people guess

whose army and navy thwart he every
endeavour
whose physical and
intellectual endowment be known far
and wide
laugh too
enjoy this

in order to restore he confidence this
french king spend a fortune on anything
that glitter on build of castle
with large tower
artfully gesture the phallic implication

but these symbol of wealth and virility
fail to convince
talk among the lady
at court in france suggest

stop herself

what

that in this department too the king
have he shortcoming
annes gesture

stare for a moment
deathly silence
have she go too far


i


xcept for the and he son and


you should have see the seymours
they
face

they must have think that with you out
of the way they have a real opportunity
with that palefaced thing of theirs
jane

but anne put pay to that
last night
the king only have eye for we boleyns

or you mean

what

m wary of any suggestion that anne
would serve anyone but herself
france
can not have changed she much

n this occasion i be quite satisfy
she be be loyal to you

really

then ask yourself this
if she be really
so concern for i wellbeing

about she
a beat
there be no half measure with anne

careful you will make i think i choose
the wrong boleyn girl





oh no

choice

life with she
the risk be with anne it

as what

i one true mistress

you be loyal to the
above all other

i wife
i barely see she

but she sit on a throne beside you
accompany you to every state function

for appearance sake only
in every
other regard we marriage be a sham

still she be you
and ever
present
and i feel she eye on i
and
those of she spy
nervously look leave and right

and look at we
forever reduced to
meeting in secret like this
speaking in
whisper
a beat
hardly conducive to passion




well what would you have i do



watch from a distance as talk to
we do not
hear they dialogue but the two be have a heated
discussion
voice be raised
plead with the to be reasonable
silence he
angrily then walk out



enter a lavish drawingroom and sit down
she pick up a
book and pretend to be reading
enter sidle up behind
putting he arm around she then

wolsey have agreed to draw up plan for
the queen to be send to a nunnery
kiss on the neck

she will protest of course
she will not
go quietly but she know she have failed
to give i a son and deserve she
exile
kiss
which leaf you all alone at court
he begin to unbutton she dress

queen in all but name

future heir
unbuttons and kiss lower low

so be this assurance enough

flicker behind annes eye then

i would like to
but i be afraid i find the
insult too much to bear

what insult








because as long as we remain unmarried
any child i give you would forever be
daub bastard and i a whore

ut what alternative be there
throw hand up in
exasperation
i love for the queen may have die but
even you must concede she be still very
much alive


katherine of aragon be alive
that woman
be not worthy of the title queen

oh anne

the marriage

that woman married two brother and
therefore sin against god

but she never consummate the marriage
with i brother

they be marry six month

arthur be a sick man

and katherine be a shrewd woman who know
that she position as queen would never
be safe until she bed you brother
talk to you adviser
they will tell
you as much
walk out
stare



sit in she study work
appear in the doorway
he face be dark
conflict


i





wolsey have agreed to charge the queen

but that be wonderful
annes smile then notice

why do you look sad

because she will contest it
which mean
putting she on trial
and hearing these
delicate matter in public

es
but any court make up of
bishop will surely find in favour
and declare the marriage invalid
now it be annes turn to start kiss round the neck

hen you i sweet lord will be free to
remarry
then i can give myself to you fully
kiss he low low

to reject the catholic church
and he
faith would never allow it

nor he good sense
break with rome
