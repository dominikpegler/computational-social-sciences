coffee shop across the street and
watch when you take he to school

anyway when i left i
be really screw up

joanna i do not give a

ted all i life i would either be
somebody daughter or somebody
wife or somebody else mother
then all of a sudden i be a thirty
twoyearold highly neurotic woman
who have just walk out on she husband
and child
i go to california
because that be about as far away
as i could get
only
i guess it
be not far enough
so i start going
to a shrink
leaning forward
very sincere
ted i have have time to think

do whatever you want
i do not
give a damn
just leave i out of it
and leave i baby out of it

ted if you can not discuss this
rationally

joanna go fuck yourself


leaning forward
intense
look she walk out on she own child
right
that be desertion right
mr
Shaunessy i be telling you it be an
open and shut case

first there be no such thing as an
open and shut case
especially where
custody be involved
get it

second the burden be on we to prove
you exwife be an unfit mother
that mean i be going to have to play
rough and if i play rough you can
bet they will too
can you take that
mr
kramer

third it will cost you five thousand
dollar

that be if we win
if we lose you
could end up have to pay you wife
court cost as well

fine

good
you have hired yourself a hell
of a lawyer mr
kramer
how old be the child

six

that be tough
in most case involve
a child that young the court tend
to side with the mother

but she signed over custody
here

i be not saying we do not have a shot
but it will not be easy
mr
kramer do i a favor

something i find very helpful in
matter like this
i sit down and
make a list of all the pro and con
on an issue
i actually write they
down and look at they
i want you to
do that okay
then after that if
you be really sure you want to retain
custody of you child then we will
go in there and whip they ass

motherhood

job while you be marry to you
exhusband

do you wish to

yes
i tried to talk to ted i ex
husband about it but he would not
listen
he refuse to discuss it in
any serious way
i remember one time
he said i probably could not get a
job that would pay enough to hire a
babysitter for billy

kramer be you employed
at the present time

yes i work for jantzen as a
sportswear designer

speaking carefully
with great thought
yes
look during the last five
year we be marry i have
i
be get more and more
unhappy
more and more frustrated
i needed
to talk to somebody
i needed to
find out if it be i if i be going
crazy or what
but every time i turned
to ted i exhusband he could not
handle it
he become very
i do not
know very threatened
i mean
whenever i would bring up anything
he would act like it be some kind
of personal attack
anyway we become
more and more separate
more and
more isolated from one another
finally i have no other choice i
have to leave
and because of i ex
husband attitude he unwillingness
to deal with i feeling i have come
to have almost no selfesteem
at the time i left i sincerely
believe that there be something
wrong with i that i son would be
well off without i
it be only
when i get to california and start
into therapy i begin to realize i
be not a terrible person
and that
just because i needed some creative
and emotional outlet other than i
child that do not make i unfit to
be a mother

you honor i would like to place in
evidence a report on mrs
Kramers

and he father
be here
as a mother i do not want
i child to be separated from his

why you be asking for custody

because he be i child
because i
love he
i know i left i son i
know that be a terrible thing to do

the same hope and dream as a man
do not i have a right to a life of i
own
be that so awful
be i pain
any less just because i be a woman
be i feeling any cheap
i left
i child i know there be no excuse
for that

mrs
phillips how long have you
known ted kramer

six year
ever since ted and joanna
moved into the build

how often do you see mr
kramer and
he son

to the judge by way
of explanation
charley i husband and i be
divorce and kim that be we daughter
be about Billys age and the child
play together a lot
so i guess we
see each three or four time a week

can you describe the relationship
between mr
kramer and he son

it be beautiful
it be just beautiful
they have a beautiful relationship

objection you honor
the answer
be to be generous very vague

can you recall any particular incident
that relate to mr
Kramers care of
he child

fighting a lose
battle with she
emotion
ted mr
kramer spend a great
deal of time with he child
i do not
just mean hour i mean good time
involve time
he read to billy
they play together
they talk all
the time
he be a very
kind man
a very
devote father and
and
and joanna if you ever see they
together
there would not be a trial
at all
she break down
weep
oh shit
i be sorry
i be sorry

no far question
thank you mrs
phillips

without looking up
from he note
no question


mr
kramer would you tell the court
exactly why you want to retain custody
of you child

when joanna
to the judge
correcting himself
i exwife when she be talking
before about how unhappy she be
during we marriage
well i guess
most of what she said be probably
true
there be a lot of thing i
do not understand a lot of thing
i would do different if i could
just like i guess there be a lot of
thing joanna wish she could
change
but we can not
some thing
once they be do can not be undone
joanna say she love billy
i believe
she do
so do i
but the way it
be explain to i that be not the
issue
the only thing that be suppose
to matter here be what be good for
billy
when joanna said why
should not a woman have the same
ambition as a man i suppose she be
right
but by the same token what
law be it that say a woman be a
good parent simply by virtue of
she sex
i guess i have have to think a
lot about whatever it be that make
somebody a good parent
constancy
patience understand
love
where be it written that a man have
any less of those quality than a
woman
billy have a home with i
i have tried to make it the good i
could
it be not perfect
i be not a
perfect parent
unconsciously echo
something joanna
said early
i do not have enough patience
sometimes i forget he be just a little
kid
but i love he
more than
anything in this world i love he

thank you mr
kramer
no **further/far
question

mr
kramer by any chance have you
ever have a woman in you bed while
you child be asleep in the next
room

i suppose

so do i

objection

sustained

switching to another
line of attack
mr
kramer be not it true that you
be fired from you last job not
more than six week ago

technically the agency lost a big
account and seventy four people be
let go
i be one of they

you be fired correct

yes but i be with
walter thompson
now
i do not think that will happen
again

give they time

objection you honor
counsel be
harass the witness

you honor i be only examining the
mane employment record
he pretend
to fitness when he cannot hold a
job

sustained

kramer do you child nearly
lose an eye when he be in you care

mr
kramer do you or do you not
tell the childes mother that you
be responsible for the injury that
permanently disfigured you child

objection
you honor counsel be
raising a question that be not germane
to these proceeding

while the child be in the care of
the witness he cut he face badly
and be now scar

be you introduce the question of
negligence here counselor

yes you honor

i see
well you will have to do well
than that
do you have any affidavit
to support negligence

i do not you honor however

this be an isolate incident
counselor unless you can prove
otherwise

do the witness deny the injury
take place

before ted can say
anything
no counselor i be going to over
rule you on this line of questioning

then i have conclude i question






ted

pass

it

allergic to grape juice but will
more than make up for the loss in
apple juice

store but not from the supermarket
do not ask i why




at time in the night he will have
nightmare one particular monster
be called the face
the face as
best as i can determine look like
a circus clown without a body and
from what the pediatrician say and
what i have read may be sexual fear
of losing he penis or a fear of
he own anger or just a circus clown
he see once




he doctor by the way be still ed
davies
the Sundafed be for cold
one tablespoon every four hour

etta Willewska and she be the main
reason for the note
she be a love
woman conscientious very concern
about billy and more important billy
care about she




i urge you to retain she
she number
be and i think she will
take the job if it be offered
i be
sure other thing will come up
ask
i what you need to and i guess
eventually we will talk




that be all i can think of except to
repeat what i said before he be a
terrific kid
i be grateful for the
time we have have together and i feel i
be a good man because of i son
ted


billy sometimes when a mother and a
father be divorced there be a
discussion about who the child should
live with the mother or the father
now there be a man who be very wise
he be called a judge
and a judge have
a lot of experience with divorce
and he decide who it would be good
for the child to live with

why do he decide

because
well that be what he do
he be a very powerful man

like a principal

big than a principal
the judge
sit in robe in a big chair
the
judge have think a lot about we
about you and i and you mom and
he have decided
he have decided that it would be
best for you to live with you mom
joanna in she apartment
and i be very lucky

what the

ted do you love he

a deep breath then

ted when we get marry it be
because i be twentyseven year old
and i think i should get marry
and
when i have billy it be because
i think i should have a baby
and i guess all i do be mess up i
life and you life and

joanna what the hell be

please

this
be the hard thing i have ever have
to do

after i left

kind of mother be i that i could
walk out on i own child
it get to
where i could not tell anybody about
billy i could not stand that look
in they face when i said he be not
living with i
finally it seem
like the most important thing in the
world to come back here and prove to
billy and to i and to the world how
much i loved he
and i do
and
i win
only
it be just another
should

she begin to break
down
sitting in that courtroom

everything you do everything you
go through

love he or how much you love he
i guess it be like you said the only
thing that count be what be good for
billy

all love be anyway
