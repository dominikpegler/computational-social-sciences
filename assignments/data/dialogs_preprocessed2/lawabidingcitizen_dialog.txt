very methodical
the tech leave the room

or more of those ingredient with
something else
industrial solvent
acid

let we not guess let forensic do
it job

we be in a goddamn prison


i will ask because somebody have to

be there any chance no matter how
remote that this be an accident
mixup

the bad part



some kind of bypass on the phone
line

the bad part
i be just on with
the governor office

remain silent

understand you right as i have
explain they

yes



check this shit out






he say he will only talk to you

nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in
Dunnigan take off he
gun and holster lay they on a table as Garza activate the

cantrell find a chair by feel sit down as

nick and Dunnigan enter
Dunnigan melt into a corner to
observe as nick sit across the table from clyde

Counselor

mr
clyde

why so formal
we go way back
call
i benson
or ben
nick sit across the table from clyde settle in

well
i be here
so

so
maybe you can explain what this
be all about
nick almost laugh not what he expect to hear

i think that be obvious
clyde spread he hand questioningly not really

you murdered two people
rupert
ames and clarence darby

detective

Dunnigan

Dunnigan
i think i would make it
clear i would only speak to the
gentleman across the table from i
Dunnigan glower at he look to nick

you murdered two people
rupert
ames and clarence darby


darby
i know about ames of course
i have be following the news about
he horribly botch execution
but
darby too
quite a coincidence

cut the shit
we know you do it
save everybody a lot of time and
trouble and just confess

be you going to continue to insist
on be part of this conversation

yes

fine
far be it from i to be rude

clarence darby be find on you
property
old abandoned she would


i do not know i have one
it be
acre uncultivated
the other day
i find a creek i never know i have
hunter trespass all the time
you
going to try to pin the dead deer
on i too


i do not believe this guy

that man be frosty


it occur to i that an even
moderately clever person could try
to frame i for the murder simply
by killing he on i property
one
of darbys drug rival
that be an
unsavory world
jury would have to weigh that
possibility
what else you get


how about video of you dismember
darby while he be still alive

that be odd
see if i be to do
such a thing i would probably wear
something so i could not be
identified
some kind of mask maybe
but you say it be actually i on the
video
do the camera capture i
good side

nick snap lunge across the table grab clyde

you sick fuck you send it to i
house
i daughter see that video
it fucking traumatize she
she
could not stop sob
Dunnigan move in fast trying to pull nick off

Whoawhoa nick ease off

no trouble here detective we be
fine
thank you though
Dunnigan back off
clyde turn back to nick who be still get
he in he grasp they face close

you daughter be what ten now
that be a wonderful age
i daughter
be always so busy at that age so
interest so into everything
jumping around
i called she bean
she jump around so much
nick be ease off by inch subtly and ineffably weirded
out unable to break Clydes gaze
softly

i be sorry nick that you daughter
experienced that
you be right
that video should not have arrive
that way
the person who send it
should have think twice
Dunnigan move in again gently but firmly pull nick away

okay enough


unless there be hard evidence tying
i to these crime forensic or
otherwise why be i here
why be
we have this conversation

we know you do it

it be not about what you know
it be
about what you can prove in court
you word
like when you called it
a justice system
you know the thing
about a system nick
any system
can be play

you think you can play we
you going to
take i on

clarence darby do
and i be much
smart than he be
or you
nick advance furious held back by Dunnigan

i be going to bury you fucker

that be it that be what i want
that
fire in the belly
that be what i
wanted ten year ago
do it nick
bury i

sit down
sit the fuck down
clyde do settle in speaking calmly

or
set i free

what

do i stutter
make you case
or
shake i hand on the courthouse
step and send i on i way
i will even make it easy on you
i
will confess how be that

you be going to confess

let we start tomorrow after a good
night sleep

this freak i out


be he serious about confess

what be he deal be he crazy

confession or not we be going to nail
he on two count of firstdegree

agreed but softly
nothing hard
ass no grandstanding
kid glove

kid glove
he be a psycho with a
power see

depend on who be writing the
headline he be a grieve husband
and father who get revenge on the
man who murdered he wife and child
public sympathy be to be respected
and feared
this could blow up in
we face if we be not careful
we
can not look like we be pissed off or
have an ax to grind
be we pissed off
do we have an ax
to grind

clyde sink with a sigh of resignation and defeat rest his

they freeze
nick and davies peer down

you must be well think of agent
davies

ask nicely by the right people
they brief i on you problem
with benson clyde

thing i can neither confirm nor
deny
thing of which if i be ask
i will disavow any knowledge
the guy trade a look
cantrell can not help chuckle

you get to be kidding i with this
guy

he be not

i get it


what be clyde
some kind of spy

spook like i be a dime a dozen
clyde be a brain
he run a think
tank invent thing for use in
the field
way to kill people
you need to get rid of somebody
it be not a situation where you can
get close
what do you do

ask clyde

that be right

strategy
he be good at it

how good

you play chess

in i line we use an aptitude
profile base on chess
tournament
level player like you can think
five to eight step ahead of an
average player do you know that
i i think about ten step ahead
so i would take you in a game

what about clyde

off the chart
if you be eight
step ahead he be twenty
or fifty
he be already get the game win on
the first move you do not even know
you be playing yet
this cellmate he killed
you think
that be random
bullshit
that be
a pawn taken off the board
if i
be you i would be trying to figure
out what the move be

any thought

top of i head
be the cellmate
ever connected with this case
or
with clyde
be anybody else in
that facility
guard
con
the
janitor
any connection at all no
matter how remote
