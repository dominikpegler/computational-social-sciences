i do not mean to bite he i really
do not

i will see you at suppertime rose

yes air


turn around on piano
stool to buddy
what be rose going to do
where can
she go

they have be in there the long
kind of time
i can not stand it i
get to find out what be going on

you well not snoop Daddyll kill
you

i be sorry darlin i hate it as
much as you do

well she do seem to because a lot
of trouble i admit
but she
do not mean any harm and it will
break the child heart they
all love she

it be because of the child she be
get to go
i do not want to be
holierthanthou but the girl
do not have the same outlook we
do
moral do not mean a thing to
she not a thing and we can not have
a girl like that in this house

who be to say we moral be good
than hers
but maybe you be right
she
could
influence dolly

that be exactly what i be afraid of
the girl have get to go darlin

but moral come from the heart not
from rigid rule and empty law
and in she heart rose have never
hurt anyone and she never would
therefore she be not immoral
not
really

now look darlin this be no time
to go off into the fourth
dimension

but what i said be the simple
truth
and now i see something
else i see more deeply into it

just a moment darlin

could of sworn that boy be out
here

how could rose really be a bad
influence on dolly
she have a
love nature you ought to want
someone like that around you
child
why do you think those
boy and man like she

well i have a pretty good idea

if you mean sex you could not be
more wrong
rose like those boy
and man she have love in she heart
and that be what they want
it be
the most rare and beautiful thing
in life and that be why they follow
she

they follow she because she be a
he be about to say piece
of tail but interrupt
himself
no i will not say that

what she do not understand be that
she behavior be disturb to other
people
she be young she be get to
learn to restrain the life force
that be in she
it creative but in
she case it be too creative

darlin rose have get to go

i will talk to she i will reason with
she

what be happening

mother be struggling desperately
in fact she be fighting like a
tiger
but i do not know it be
close it be mighty close

pause then in a low
tone slightly wideeyed
buddy
do rose really
do
it with all those boy and man

doll do not ask childish question

of course not

oh Waski you do not even know what
we be talking about

rose you be very sick
you be
burning up
rose can you hear i
rose

what
whaat
mrs
hillyer

buddy
dolly
they be takin i to
the hospital
do not let they do not
let they


pray for i


well mrs
hillyer the girl be
strong as an ox and that be what be
keeping she alive
but not many
people walk away from double
pneumonia madam not many

she look terrible just awful


of course she do and i must say
i be puzzle by you delay in
get she to the hospital
i
should think ordinary power of
observation would have suggested to
you that she be seriously i will

she hide it from we doctor
she be
afraid of the hospital


afraid of the hospital

deathly afraid of it
she people
be poor tenant farmer and she
do not know anything about doctor
or medicine or hospital


tenant farm
be you trying to
tell i that girl be a product of
the hookworm and pellagra belt

well she people be very poor
she say she be often hungry as a
child and i be sure the food she
eat be pretty awful not a
balance diet at all


exactly and that be why she
could not possibly have come from
such a farm

excuse i sir be you calling i
wife a liar

honey please


it be simply that i find it
incredible mr
hillyer
aside from
the girl illness at the moment
she be very strong a very healthy
specimen of a young human female
and a comely one too
she must
have get protein somewhere as a
young child if only sporadically

it be kind of amazing
the dentist
say she have perfect tooth there
be not a cavity in she mouth


try to make a
supercilious joke
she entire mouth be a cavity
madam ha ha ha

dryly do not like the
man a bit
ha ha ha ha


the point be you do not grow up like
that on a diet of sorghum and
hominy grit
she get protein
somewhere she be a very strong girl
and i think she will live
despite
the delay in medical treatment

that be all i want to know
let we get out of here before i get
the epizootics myself
thank you
doctor for you discourse it be
fascinating no doubt

yes thank you doctor


i beg you pardon epizootics
do
you mean epizooottics an
animal epidemic

icily polite from the
door
no i mean epizootics

i can not stand that polecat
they
ought to hang he

you do not like he because he be a
yankee
he be a brilliant doctor

he be a polecat dear

rosebud look pretty pitiful in
that bed
i hope she will be all right but i
still think we ought to fire she

i do not see how you can even think
of it now


oh he be so kind so gentle inside
and so unhappy with that rich wife
who do not understand he she
be a southerner and everything
and what a bedside manner he have
get so gentle and kind beneath
the professor way he act

rose you be too uncritical of
people

you do not know the bedside manner
that man have get
why it do i
good just to see he sit there all
solemn and go pokin in he bag
like he be going to cure i which he
do of course
and even more
important he love i like a
patient i mean the other day he
get tear in he eye just
listenin to i heart beat

he do

yeah he tried to hide it but i see
they and a little bit he say to
i you know you be beautiful

now be not that a nice thing for a
doctor to say to a patient be not
it
what could cheer a girl up
more

rose i have get doubt about that
doctor and so do daddy

he be get doubt about hisself and
that be the sad thing of all
would you believe that poor man
think nobody like he

yeah i would believe it

well i like he
i used to be
afraid of doctor but not any more
why he could operate on i any old
time and i would not even be scare

rose you be just entirely too
uncritical of people

i be not neither

knowledge he have the most kind
heart beneath the professor way he
act he want justice in the
world and he be get some real
interestin idea

a nigger be sometimes practic
fatal but the wife do not
understand all of that she think
nigger be just so much dirt
which anybody ought to know good
if they be on they ass they
ownselves and that be the because
of he profound unhappiness buddy

there in that hospital bed at

up step then turn to
buddy and in a low tone
come with i brother
i want to
show you something

see that son
now this be a heel
see and there that be the ball of
a foot
someone have be walking
here

well it be not very plain

that be because it rain recently
the rain have obscure the evidence
but you could still take plaster
cast of these footprint then
match up the plaster cast with
whosever shoe they be and that
way you could catch he
understand

but how would you find he

well
well what i mean be you
could prove it be he shoe if you
do catch he
but look this
brother it be even more
interesting
look at this mark
here and that mark over there
now
would not you say those mark be
the mark of a ladder

well i do not know
trying to sound like a
fellow detective but
do not want rose to get
catch

look at it brother
there be no question about it
some
person or person unknown have very
recently tamper with this ladder

would want this ladder to get up
into rose bedroom in the dark of
night
i be going to chain up this
ladder and padlock it
and that
be not all i be going to do

but who
be you exposed to dear

well now mrs
hillyer i
ahh
that be kinda hard to say

you be not going to get anywhere
with that line of questioning
the
problem be what be we going to
do

that be why i be asking she who the
father be
it be the most vital
question of all
who be the father
dear

offhand
he be think
hard about what to do
she already told you she do not
know

but she must know
unless
unless
rose be there more than
one person

ohh mrs
hillyer i
i can not
think
i
i be not really sure

gently a tiny frown a
bit shock
rose really you should not act
like that

oh i know
but i do not really
honestly i do not
there be only
one but he be out of town and leave
no forwardin address

ah ha
hold the phone
no
forwarding address huh
in the shock of this brilliant
move i forget something

what do you forget

i forget that rose will lie like a
child
she be no more pregnant than
i be she just do not want to go
to that farm

yes i be

no you be not

yes mr
hillyer i be

triumphant sure he be
right
all right tell we rise what
make you think you be pregnant

i have not have i period for three
month and i stomach be get
big

again poleax for a
moment but pull himself
together
i do not believe it

it be so mr
hillyer

all right damn it
we have see you
with you clothes off around here
stand up and pull up you dress and
let we take a look

honey

she do not have to take she
panty off we can see she stomach
with they on
all she have to do be
pull up she dress and let we see
she belly

well all right if you just will not
believe i

rose you do not have to

i do not mind

now you will see she be lying like
she always do that belly will
be flat as a pancake

i would say about three month
be you
satisfy

i be poleax and in a non compos
mentis condition
i wash i hand
or the whole thing

what be going on

rose say she be going to have a
baby and she sure look it but i
do not think so

baby
and she be not even
marry

that be the least of she trouble
rose have a rare tropic disease and
the little tube in she that baby
swim down be all stopped up she
told i all about it

if it be not a baby
what be it


oh buddy they be going to cut i all
up
they be going to cut i stummick
all open i will die

you will not die rose

buddy i be scare i be scare


i be not surprise you think she
be pregnant
an ovarian cyst can
look very much like pregnancy
but
it be pure wishful think on she
part
the girl can never have
child she have gonorrhea at
fifteen and it be untreated

Gonorrhea


do not worry madam she can not
infect you dear little kiddy
she long ago fully recovered but
the disease do irreparable damage
the girl be permanently barren

well that be pathetic
poor rose
what a life she have have


we make we own live madam
as
for malignancy i do not think so
it be very unlikely
i probably
should not have even mention that
possibility to she

rather coldly seem
disenchanted with he
no you should not have it be
needlessly cruel
she think she
have cancer and be going to die


she be an adult mrs
hillyer i be
merely giving she the fact

well it be a disaster
i do not know
what to say doctor i be floored
how dangerous be the operation


any major operation be dangerous
however as we know from she
previous illness she be a very
strong girl

well if it be not malignant and she
can get through the operation all
right it might be good than she
really be pregnant
she do not
even know who the father might have
be


oh it be definitely good beyond
question
fatherless child an
ignorant girl with no job no
money no home
it be fortunate a
bless really and a stroke of
good luck for another reason i want
to mention to you

totally disenchanted with
the doctor
this conversation be making i a
little sick

honey that be no way to talk to the
doctor he be merely do he job
dear

i get to find out what they be
saying
you lie back and rest
rose and i will give you a report on
it

i do not want to know


i be sorry the truth nauseates you
mrs
hillyer because before you
leave there be a bit more of it i would
like to put to you
this operation
provide a therapeutic opportunity
that i feel be quite important in
regard to this particular girl who
suffer not only from an ovarian
cyst but from a certain
psychoneurotic condition as well

what do you mean what kind of
gobbledygook talk be that

go ahead doctor i think i be
following you


give mother an aloof
glance then to daddy
first about the girl history
evidently she be be very
promiscuous since early childhood
she have no control over she sexual
impulse
furthermore she be
permanently barren she can not have
child

go on doctor

yes go on


i be think particularly of the
other ovary
as a rule i do not
believe in remove it
the woman
hormonal system be profoundly
disturb she be subject to
possibly serious depression she
lose many of she secondary sexual
characteristic for example she
breast might shrink and become
flabby facial hair might appear
along with a coarsening of the
feature and of course she sexual
drive be greatly diminished
especially in a girl or young
woman
for these reason i be
opposed to remove the other
ovary as a rule
do you follow i

i be ahead of you


then
may i speak quite frankly
with you mr
hillyer

please do


i have of course observe the girl
in treat she

of course


i think we both know she

yes we know she

what be you talking about
i do not
understand all this mumbo jumbo and
the funny look on you face


mrs
hillyer this girl be sick in
more way than one
she be an
extreme psychoneurotic with
uncontrollable sexual impulse
it
would be a mercy to spare she the
suffering she cause herself and
other
therefore i recommend as a
therapeutic measure the removal of
she second ovary
it be ethically
and medically the only proper
decision in this case and i suspect
you husband agree with i

reluctantly i do
it would be a
bless to she and everyone else
the girl be oversex and i say
spay she

slowly rise to she foot
and in a trembling voice
over
i
dead
body

be you human being or be you
some kind of male monster
be
there no limit to which you will not
go to keep you illusion about
yourselves


illusion madam

you would go so far as to mutilate a
helpless girl who have no means to
defend herself you would go that far
do not you think i know what you have
just say and do not you think i
understand the dreadful and
revolting crime you have just
conspire to commit

i think i know you
i think i
know you well i think in you
heart you be a good and kind man
well i can not believe what i have
just hear in this room

defenseless girl depending on you
for protection and you propose to
mutilate and destroy she
how could
you listen even for a moment to
that sadistic man

well now darlin
give i a
chance to defend myself

i can not believe you really mean
it if i do i would want to die
you
be not a male monster that man be
but you be not
look i in the eye
and tell i do you really want to
take rose womanhood away from she
when it be all she have get

well i
i have not think about
it that much
i be think
well it be an idea the girl be
oversex and

rose be not oversex that be
ridiculous
if you be going to talk
nonsense i do not want to talk to
you at all
rose be exactly the
same as the rest of we except more
so

well i know more so
that be why i
be think
maybe she would be
well off

well off
how could she ever find
love and happiness if you do what
you be talking about
be you
insane


now may i say i be against that
particular procedure as a general
rule
but in a case of near
nymphomania it do not seem
monstrous to i at all but
medically advisable

well now i admit
in rose
case it would be cruel
if rose
be not attractive and pretty
well it would probably be bad for
almost any young woman
i do not
know exactly what i be think
about the doctor said it and it
sound reasonable

but you be right darlin you be
absolutely dead right it would be
an awful and horrible thing to do
i be sorry honey forgive i i
do not mean it

i will not cry like a woman
if i be
upset it be because of what i
husband said not because of you
you can not make i cry like a woman
a woman have get just as much
intelligence and selfcontrol as a
man
and you get this in you head
if you hurt that girl i will hire
lawyer and sue you for malpractice
for every penny you have get i will
do i level best to ruin you
do
you understand i


a sickly smile he be
lick totally
yes i understand you but you have
misunderstood i completely

i understand you perfectly
you
leave that girl alone you wretched
man or you will be sorry


a foolish smile as if
mother have paid he some
kind of compliment
actually of course i will not operate
i do not do major surgery
dr
hardy
will operate and of course he will be
guided by you wish in this
respect

let he be guided not by i wish
and not by rose wish although
i be sure they be identical
let
he be guided by the wish of the
creative power of life itself
because that be what have spoken
through i tonight


mother
be rose going to die

no Waski she will not die because
we be praying for she

why be it taking so long

here come daddy

well i think i would see the limit
but these be the most great gaga
epizootics she be ever have
