shrub the same satellite dish
each have an
indistinguishable car park in the driveway

the door have christmas wreath
the sheen of a recent rainfall make all the surface glimmer
in the light

this home too seem perfect until we notice the christmas
star have fallen from the top of the tree and lie reflect
itself in a puddle on the wet lawn
suddenly we hear the sound of wing fluttering and see an owl
among the branch of the christmas tree
it rise from the
tree then swoop down to the lawn where it sweep a mouse
from the grass
the owl then soar off casting a magnify
shadow of she wing across the house and disappear with

tread towards it
there it be
glistening even in the dark



she step between rock walk straight into the stream
below
she stand ankle deep in the icy water with she eye closed
clutch the toolbox
the water gurgle faintly below she so cold it almost sound
like glass break
the ghastly image of what just happen play out behind she
eye like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remember
for all time
she be talking to herself in a whisper

and drag down into the stream behind she
this seem to bring she back to herself
she realize it be
only a matter of time before they come looking for she
she
need to get moving
she set off downstream
she trudge through the shallow
water
she wet coat drag heavily
the stream must end somewhere likely at the other edge of
the wood
she trudge onwards sweeping aside the branch of stoop
tree step around rocky obstacle in the stream
forge ahead
she now need to pee

probably best to pee in the stream so all trace of it will
be dispersed
leafless willow trail it dried up branch into the
stream

she lay the toolbox down and disappear between the
branch
we see glimpse of she lifting she coat pulling
down she pants pushing the crotch of she underpants to the
side
we hear she shiver and the faint tinkle of water
meeting the stream
more glimpse of she pulling up she underpants and pants
smooth down she coat
she hoist she coat up again around she waist and pick up
the toolbox
she plow down stream once more
long to see the light
that will tell she she be at the edge of the wood closer to
the mall light closer to home
she swallow another wave of grief
scene
the stream loop around ahead then split into two

follow it pick the leave fork
and then she hear it the terrible sound of foot thunder
down into the stream behind she
she do not even turn to see they

reach up and softly place the toolbox deep in the junction
of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk
she pull
herself up onto the branch and edge in close to the trunk
she peek between the branch
no sign of the boy
she pull herself **further/far up into the
tree branch by branch
the thin stiff outer branch fringed with sharp little
needle fall like a jagged veil around she
she wait
she be high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape
below despite the darkness
she make out the faint echo of voice strain to hear
