i turn
i turn
no i be next
no i
uncle phil uncle phil can
i do one
i want to do one

guy guy please
this be risky
stuff here
and i be a highly train
professional

okay okay
uncle phil will launch
another booster

just as soon as he complete his
fuel intake

it will take we six month just to get
to mars
another year on the surface
then six month back
that be two
year

i guess what i be trying to say be
since this be i last night on earth
it be going to be a very precious memory
to i
know

nice try nick

hey woody we mars one crew will not
be heading back to earth till ten
day after you guy land at we base
camp with mars two
that be a pretty
good long rendezvous

what be you suggest sergei

maybe you should bring a baseball
bat
yes
american baseball
we two
crew could have ourselves a little
solar system series

please
half you guy be foreigner
we would crush you

no no we have equal crew
three
man one woman
same handicap

easy now you be talking about i
wife
and terri just happen to be one
helluva shortstop

fast pitch no steal batter call
he own strike
thousand buck make
it interesting

eh bien
winner take all

good
smile sweetly at
kirov
bring some ball

you want to know the sad part
technically i outrank she
but if we
want any peace at all on mars two
i be going to be saying a lot of yes
dear


just not sure how i feel about
allow couple to go on this
type of mission together

nothing personal terri
it be just
that well it be kind of a funny
feeling for those of we staying
behind

all the research show that marriage
will provide stability on these long
duration trip

then they have not studied some of
the couple i have known

anybody see jim mcconnell

i do not think he be coming

god that poor man
how be he do

totally losing it from what i hear
can not sleep can not eat
visit she
grave almost every day
they say he could lose mission status

oh that be so sad
that be just so
tragic
you go to a routine physical
one day and wham

after all those year of train
too
it be they whole dream

must be a pretty funny feel for
luke graham
know
now he be going to
be in the history book
first man
on mars

he be not coming luke

jim deserve this too
all he
friend be here
and it be i last
night

you last night with we too

i love you deb

i love you too baby
but maybe you
should spend some time with bobby

yeah
i will
where be he

up in he fort

deep space be so lonesome
so cold
but i guess i will have i memory to
keep i warm

who be going to read to i now at
bedtime

mommy will

i like when you do it
now we be
never going to finish we book

well i will tell you what
i have be
think about that
and what i
thought be how about if i bring
along i own copy
then every night wherever i be
i will read a little bit more of it
and i will know that you and mommy
wherever you be you be reading it
too
that way it will feel like we be
still reading it together
because i
do not know about you but i be pretty
anxious to find out how ol ben gunn
get marooned on that island
what
you say

good deal
can i have a hug

we be afraid you would not come

i caught a whiff of you barbecue
after that i be helpless

all the way out in galveston

something like that
it be he night deb
i do not want
to spoil it

spoil it
he be be going crazy
looking for you

mon
whole lot of folk here be
going to be mighty glad to see you


i wish we be all going
together

then you have get a short memory
think
back to how we be by the second
week of lunar train

oh you be not going to bring that up
again

i be trying to remember let we see
which one of we score the low
ranking up there

you just can not let that go

oh man three commander on the
same ship
if they send we off to
mars together there would not be
enough fuel to lift all those ego

bullshit we would have make a great
crew

that be never going to happen
i be
always team with maggie and we
be mostly chalkboard jockies
you
know
system
payload

listen to he
mr
CoverofTime
magazine

yeah who landed the cripple block
shuttle

yeah and who score high on the
lunar ranking

let it go luke

sure i make a little noise
but
putting the first footprint on mars
nah
that be for guy who
write they ph

thesis on how
to colonize the place
and guy who
read too much science fiction as
a kid and still wear little flash
gordon rocketships around they neck

you read the same damn science fiction
book that i do
you be just not
man enough to wear jewelry

you want flash
you know you want
he
well you will have to come through
i

god she would have loved to see you
two clown
just one more time

hey woodrow be not it about time
you donate this thing to a museum

internal combustion boy
accept no
substitute

jim if there be ever
if there be
anything terri and i can do

i be okay
really
thanks

see you when i get to mars luke
do not solve all the mystery of the
universe okay
leave a little
something for the next guy

i will see what i can do
just make
sure you bring some fresh beer

you get it

should have be you mission jim
yours and Maggies

none of we ever wanted mars the way
you two do
not even woody
twelve
year of hope for this assignment
train for it

that be all over now

if maggie have not get sick if
you have not pull yourself out of
the rotation to take care of she

no i be going to say this
i have to
say it
i wanted mars one
hell i battle
you for it every step of the way
never wanted to beat anybody so bad
in i life
but not like this
jim i would give this all up in a second
if it would bring maggie back to we

i know that luke
you do not have to
say it
mars be yours now
go get
it

take care of yourself

yeah
you too

luke you read i

yeah renee

luke i just get on line and
well we think you be going to want to
see this for yourself

copy that

what the hell be that

no idea boss

where be it

you do not want to know

mon what be so funny
give i the
coordinate

latitude degree north longitude
degree west

the plain of Cydonia
so
oh no
you be not telling i

Oui
Exactement
it be Kirovs fault
he picked today sector

hey mon
we have get a scientific
duty to check that thing out

great
that be great
the first anomaly
we hit and it be get to be in the one
place guaranteed to make look
ridiculous
you know how many book
have be written about that damn
mountain

the egyptian put it there

no the amazon

no it be little green man

and all because a couple of lousy
impact crater happen to look like
eye socket
if this get out we will
have every kook on earth spout
off on the six of the clock news
mon
people give i a read here
be that a
cinder cone

nah too smooth
too angular
volcanic
upwel

no fissure
no caldera

it be an upwel for sure
but
maybe not volcanic

look at the color
and see how shiny
it be
i could swear that be ice

this far south

impossible
you can not have ice at
this latitude
not unless

oh i god

how far away be it

sixteen kilometer northeast
take
we twenty minute to get there

let we send a packet to Micker
then
we will go check it out


this be a truly anomalous formation
look like nothing we have see so
far
the structure appear to be
crystalline at least from the angle
displayed by

we be all trying not to go too nut
up here but we think there be a
good chance this could be an extrusion
from some subsurface geothermal
column of water
and if we be right

then we have find the key to
permanent human colonization

tell geology and hydrology we need
to scramble on this
Fullcourt press

anyway be going out to take a
closer look at it try to get an
idea of it composition
by the time you receive this we
should be just about onsite

jesus christ

anyone else hear that

yeah
what be it

sound like we antenna out of
phase

can you fix it

hey skip i can fix anything

big talker
renee sergei let we
break out the radar see what this
thing make of

and this be the mars mission
control room nickname Micker
i
understand a comm packet be incoming
from mars one base camp so you may
find this interesting

that man over there
he be in charge

no actually that be jim mcconnell
the
we voice link to the
astronaut
jims be with the manned
mars program since it inception
one of we real pioneer

will he be going to mars too

ah no
this be as close as he get

anyway that be about it
we will
send another packet when we get back

oh right
one more thing
today be
a very special day for a good friend
of ours and i know he be there right
now

now he hate it when any fuss be
make so i will not mention he name

because the last thing in the
world i would ever want to do be embarrass
someone like jim mcconnell

mon you Micker weasel sing

sing a line then
to

hey ray
take a look at he
be he
all red with one of those fake i be
agoodsport grin

and hey you guy check out ray
do he have on one of he this
be notinmymissionplan face

nothing you can do about it ray
we be a hundred million mile away

happy birthday jimbo
make a wish

catch you again soon
take care
buddy
end of transmission

well
what be under there

je ne sais pas
i
i think there be
something wrong with the equipment

what

i mean it can not be right
it say
it say there be metal under there

there be ten twelve meter of rubble
and sand and then
solid metal

that do not make any sense
you be
reading a vein of ore

no
it be under the whole mountain

nick could the problem with the
antenna be interfering

could be

try it closer and up the power
i will
watch the screen

ah we be all pretty stoke about
that formation you spotted mars
one
the folk in the geology and
hydrology back room be going over
you image and compare they to
every photomap they have get

nick how we coming on that antenna

going as fast as i can boss

hey nick
come show i how stupid i
am
i can not get this to work

medical want i to remind you that
you be three day late on you blood
test
i know they be a bore but
you have get to get they do or
else
or else i do not know what
just do they okay

all set here chief

okay
crank up the juice and let we
see what be in this sucker

i think that be about it for business
but on a personal note be advise
that ah none of you can sing worth
a damn

why do that stop

honestly luke if you guy do not
have anything good to do with you
time i can make some suggestion to
mission medical
there be bad
thing than blood test

oh and i talk to debra
she and
bobby be do fine
say to tell
you they be ah they be on they
third time through the book page
page
they send they love
and say take care of yourself
same
from we here buddy
till next time
then
end of transmission


problem
hatch door malfunction
backup power fail manual override
fail
solution
replace circuit
breaker


okay
piece of cake

god who dream up these nightmare

do not try to change the subject

i be not
we be talking about you
sister wedding right

very funny
we be talking about
dance lesson
before i sister
wedding

honey do you mind
i have get a
catastrophic power failure here

woody we be a marry couple
would
it kill you to invite i out on the
floor once in awhile

i dance with you at we wedding

i be not talking about shuffling you
foot around while you grab i butt
i mean real dance
Chacha rhumba
jitterbug

face it honey some couple dance
some go to mars
that be life

i be serious
we have get two more month
in this train rotation but just
as soon as we get home we be starting
lesson
if we never dance people
will think there be something wrong

if they see i dance they will know
there be something wrong

you be such a lug

cockpit this be control

control this be cockpit

uh terri they want we all back in
the station
report to Micker

who say report to Micker

the little man who live in i head

phil mon
we just start this
drill

woody it be ray beck
he told i
to round up the team
now

then at the Xband continuous
data stream from mars go silent
all data m environmental
everything suddenly stopped
while
we be trying to figure out what
the hell go wrong we get a signal
from the folk at the large array at
Soccoro

at the same moment we lost the data
stream they picked up an intense
burst of energy from mars

what do you mean intense

catastrophic

what about the crew

the level of energy in the pulse
do not seem survivable

what about the
it go into
mars orbit last week
maybe that
could give we some clue

good think woody
that be just
what we tried next

the resupply module checked out fine
no instrument failure no change in
status
orbit holding steady
but
there be something else
the
computer contained an uplink message
a very faint highly distort
transmission from mars one base camp

Someones alive

yes

how

the message be almost indecipherable
two team be still working on it
you well see for yourselves

still concentrate on the audio
we
managed to bring out a couple more
word but we have get a long way to
go

show we whatever you have get

make this quick
may be only ch
to the site when we
hit we
just as we
ther be all dead

low sound that we could not
understand
then all of a sudden
there be this terrib
another long burst
of static
stem be holding up for now
but i do not know how long i can

that be it

what do luke mean by a low sound


if this be a earthquake as we be
now assuming there be usually an
auditory component

but that energy pulse they picked up
in new mexico

electromagnetic emission
not uncommon
with largescale geophysical
phenomenon

cause this kind of damage
i do not
buy it
we be missing something here

luke must be in pretty bad shape if
he have not blasted out of there in
the earth return vehicle
that thing
design so even one crew member
could fly it back to earth

even if luke be in great shape he
could not get home
that energy pulse
would have fried the computer

other than the computer how do we
think the fare

well so far we model say it
should be in pretty good shape

which mean it be going to be up to we
to get new motherboard drive and
software to mars
as fast as we can

whoa slow down
it be going to take we
week just to analyze this data

right but meanwhile we have get to be
working up a mission plan

luke need we now

luke may already be dead
and even
if he be not it be doubtful he be going
to be able to transmit again
so we
would not know whether it be safe to
land until you be almost there

what about

the saturn image probe
it be going
to slingshot around mars on it way
through the solar system
it could
be retasked to take picture read
radiation level at mars one base
camp

good idea phil
if tell we
luke have not survive and it be not
safe to land we swing around mars
and come right back home

yes
we can design the mission to
have a free return capability
it be
a long trip but if you do not land
it be the good option

we be get ahead of ourselves
you be forget the big problem
the orbit be all wrong
we first
decent launch window be almost eight
month from now

but we can go early and get there
fast if we reconfigure the payload
for extra fuel
we have model that
ray
i have model it

on paper yeah
but those stress
have never be tested in space

the ship can take it

i be not think of just the ship

i know the protocol for a mars
recovery mission good than anybody
because i helped design they
and
i be saying these guy can do it

he be right ray
we have get a real
shot

give i an update mission plan by
tomorrow
then i will put it in
the works

you will have it by

let we get to work

chief could i have a word

i have no longer get the right crew

what do you mean
Bjornstrom can be
up here on the next shuttle

Bjornstrom be a geologist
he be good
but not for this
i people just
lost eight month of train
this
be a different mission with a
different objective

i have not be given authorization
for a mission yet

but when you be it ought to be
given the good chance for success
i
want mcconnell to fly right seat

he be no longer on mission status

yeah
because you washed he out

he washed himself out
he only have
to pass a few more psych evaluation
but he refused to take they

ray he be the good pilot i ever see
and you have get he bench at a desk

everybody have to pass the psych
prelim
no exception
jim know
that

maggie be he wife
he do not want
to lie on a couch and share she with
stranger

that be he call
but i have to make
one too
it be tough as hell but
i would do it again

he wife wasted away in front of he
eye
what be he suppose to do
suck it up
get with the program
what be he crime
that he be upset
that he cry

i could not trust he

not in a crisis
i be sorry woody
but jim lost he edge
be you going to
stand there and tell i jim mcconnell
be the same man he be two year
ago
you want i to bet four more
live on that

when maggie die yeah it knock
the shit out of he
it knock the
hell out of all of we
but you know
and i know that he be still the good
we have get
he and maggie write the
book on mars
he be get more hour in
the sim than the rest of we put
together
ray we can do this
give
i mcconnell as copilot and we
will bring luke home
and that be a
promise


what be that

that
be the exact chemical
composition of i ideal woman

used to be

hey

now what be it

frog

i guess now we have we answer to
the effect of longterm
interplanetary travel on the human
mind
the answer be phil

i be going to get an update on
it
should be just about close enough to
start capture some surface image

hey skip

take a look

what do you make of that

dust storm
southern hemisphere
coming from the east
big fella
too

head for Chryse Planitia

yup
could get a little hairy just
about land time

we will have to be ready to move fast
maybe even advance we
those
thing can cover the whole planet
and last up to a year

when do do she flyby

tomorrow morning about
that be
when we find out whether we come all
this way for nothing

i money on luke

what bring this on

ZeroG
i last chance to be graceful
once we be in mars gravity it be
back to shuffling i foot and grab
she butt

i will take what i can get

attention
incoming packet

it be

look desert

it be still standing though
so be
the
and look there be the
greenhouse

we know luke survive for at least a
few hour
question be be there
any sign of recent activity

there

what the hell be those

grave

hold on
there be only three
that
means

phil

it mean luke must still be

no
it just mean there be nobody
left to bury he

check the radiation level

normal

go to the disaster site

what be wrong

i do not know
magnetic interference

go to infrared

must be a problem with
i do not
see how an earthquake six month
ago could give we this kind of
distortion

that be no quake

then what the hell be it

we be going to continue analyze
this data and try to determine what
the problem be with those image
frankly we be just as stump as
you guy but we will keep on it
we agree that the evidence of the
grave be inconclusive and that a
ground search be advisable
be aware
there be little sand storm kicking
up near mars one base but the big
one you spotted be turning south
it
should not be a factor

we be all pretty excite here and
we be sure you must be feeling the
same
enjoy you meal and get a good
night sleep
we anticipate that
tomorrow morning you will be go for
mars orbital insertion

god bless you and goodnight
end of
transmission

what if you opened up you meal pack
and find that instead of putting
in everything but red one they would
make a mistake and put in only red
one

hey that be a funny notion
and what
if in you meal pack instead of
brown rice there be springloaded
spike that shoot into you eye

how do you ever pass the psych
evaluation

when you be schizophrenic they take
the high score

jims first ship be seriously
underpowered

maggie be always starstruck

i will get you guy for this

when they meet at the air force
academy it be love at first
flight


after that train be tough
all jim could think about be
exploring a heavenly body
more ribald
as

but maggie as you can see keep he
on a short leash
until

mission accomplished

today we celebrate a new chapter in
they story
and guy it be a pretty
historic one

let we hear it for the newlyannounced
captain and CoCaptain of mars one
to jim and maggie

when you guy land it will prove once
and for all there be no intelligent
life on mars

hey mon what if i be right

oh no here we go
do not get she
start
somebody put on some music

it be we sister planet

oh brother

maggie why do this have to be
about we
mars be a great opportunity
for pure science

we will do the science
and we will do
it very well
that be what we have
trained for
but what if there be
more
in all we myth in every
human culture mars have always hold
a special attraction
what if that
mean something
only we do not
understand it yet

the universe be not chaos
it be
connection
life reach out for
life

this be what we be born for be not
it
to stand on a new world and
look beyond it to the next one
it be
who we be

you okay

yeah
i be good to go

after all these year
can you
believe it
tomorrow we will be standing
on mars

you know what
she may have be
right

if that be not a quake down there
then something else cause it
or
planned it
you be think the
same thing

it be never be out of i mind

jesus
you realize what this means

she know woody
she be the only
one of we that ever think there
might be something down there

yeah and we be not leaving until we
find out
deal

maggie be the good of we

range and close
minute
till mars orbital capture

okay people let we look sharp
if we
overshoot there be no coming back



yeah and drifting through eternity
will ruin you whole day

Micrometeoroids

breach hit in the hull

outgass
losing pressure

woody seal the breech

kill those alarm

still outgass in the low hab
there must be another hole down there
even big

losing pressure fast
we be going to
decompress

computer how long until zero
atmosphere

four minute nine second

if we get below atmosphere the
power will shut down

be you sure

positive
vacuum inside the ship
would because a total electrical
failure
the nav computer will fry

we will lose all control
we will not be
able to fire the engine to capture
mars orbit

it be already starting
the primary
hub have be smashed
the system
be crash

everybody switch to suit oxygen
we
beat this in the simulator we can
do it here
jim you have get the ship
i be going

mon people let we go
let we work
the problem

jesus it be still bleed

keep the pressure on

eighty percent atmosphere

jim you have get to get you spare
helmet from storage

no time
phil can you keep the nav
computer online

i can not get this damn machine to re
initialize
and the automate system
just go down
we can not shut down
the hab rotation from here

i will do it from below

we be losing pressure
you could
embolize

seventy percent atmosphere

jim i have get an idea
if you guy
can save enough atmosphere i will
disconnect the power in the main
computer bay then jump start the
system
i will do a hard boot

have that ever be tested

be you kidding
these machine be
much too valuable

do it

jim how we do on the

just one goddamn second
come on
mon

voice print identification

mcconnell

accept
shut down artificial
gravitational rotation

hang on

sixty per cent atmosphere



get some light on the hole so i can
locate it

i have get a good idea
stay there



i be topside jim do you know which
sector



i be workin on it

jesus uh this be going to be like
searching for a needle in a haystack

shake out the liquid

jim i do not

shake it out near the hull

mon mon where be you



fifty per cent atmosphere

woody the breech be in sector four
sector four copy that



copy i heading there now

sonofabitch
you never do that in
the simulator

where be you you little bastard
where be you

forty percent atmosphere

whoa

Gotcha

thirty percent atmosphere

twenty percent atmosphere


now

come on
come on

twenty percent atmosphere

pressure stabilize
atmosphere
level increase

yes
Awriiiight
have it all the way
yes

shit

get back in here guy

jim there be a lot of scarring
i would well check for other puncture
while i be out here



negative negative
woody get back
inside
we have get to start the
checklist for orbital insertion

a beat
reluctantly
copy i be heading there now

hey beautiful

know what
you have get enough left

piece of cake

well
easier than the chacha

i do not know what you be get so
cocky about
we score good time
in the sim at least twice

how be he hand

seem
couple of the tendon be
going to be a little tight for awhile
try to close you finger phil
nice and slowly

well at least i will still be able to
drive

we be ready to light this candle
GoNo go for braking burn and
engine

go

system

go

nav

go

we be go for the burn
i be fueling
the engine



optimum angle of entry minus seven
degree
six
five

four
three

jim

let we go to mars

what the

shut down engine

engine negative
no response
i have
get no attitude control

manual separation
blow the bolt

negative
the do not have enough
thrust to correct this rotation

we be too steep
falling into the
atmosphere

christ at this angle we will burn up

how much time we get

i do not know
three minute
i do not
know

where be the

the resupply module
why
that be not

where be it

uh it be close

damn it how close

do not know
it will take time

we do not have time
figure it out
now

jim we be dead stick there be no
way to maneuver this ship into a
linkup

not the ship
just we
we have to go


you want we to transfer in suit

jesus jim if we do not make it
if we miss the

there be no other choice
phil how
close

one kilometer that be the good i can
do

prepare to abandon ship

on i mark seven percent left
thruster
three two one fire

okay
let we go

what be you looking for

earth

hey
when we get back
we really
will have to try this in the sim

how we do on fuel woody

i be at fifty percent
but i do not see the

there she be

jesus
she be not where i think
she would be

we be going to miss she

what do you think

we can not catch it
not like this

use the tether

we will only have one maybe two shot
before she be out of reach

it will be good if i leave you the
gun while i run out to the
i have get enough fuel left for that

you will be going too fast

i will aim to overshoot then brake
like hell
arc it in

seeya in a few

okay
i be on path to overshoot
i be
going to take the edge off

i be out
coming in hot
still long
abandon the unit
i will brake with
suit jet

oh jesus
jesus

suit jet go
but i be going to make
contact

at what velocity

impact going to be a little rough

at what velocity

Thirtytwo

i be going to use the gun to slow you

no
you slow i and i will fall short

it be too fast woody

no choice
i will be okay
here we
go

woody

woody what be you status

uh well no suit jet and i be still
carrying a good deal of velocity

as soon as we get hook up i will
come get you

uh i would have to say negative on that
jim

negative on the transmission

no i hear you
negative on the
maneuver
i be not retrievable

woody that be not possible
you be
not going that fast

it come down to the amount of fuel
honey
the suit jet be design
for attitude control not travel
retrieval just will not work

it have to work

hey believe i i do not like it any
more than you do

woody

run the number jim

i be

woody you hang tight
we will get
into the fire she up drop she
into a low orbit and come scoop
you up

sound good jim

it be going to take half an hour to get
the reorient
Woodyll be
he will be in the atmosphere by then

then we will have to get she move
fast

we do not have time

you listen to jim honey
it be a
good plan

no
we be going to

oh jesus look
the ship

look out

brake

okay let we get inside
phil start
dumping the cargo or there will not be
room for we

but we need those supply for

dump the cargo
hang on woody

will do jim

hey beautiful

terri no

goddammit terri it will not work

terri what be you do

i will tell you what i be not do
woody
i be not going to watch you
die

terri

you would do the same for i

get inside
dump the cargo then
start the system
now

no
i would not come for you
not if
it just be not possible

i can do it

no terri you can not
you do not have
enough fuel to get i stop we both
and get we back
hell you come any
farther and you will not have enough to
get back yourself

listen to i goddammit
you have to
stop
you have to stop now

he be right terri
it be no use

okay honey
you get to go back
now

the hell i do

what be you do

i be going to jet a little close and
try again

terri you spend any fuel get
closer you will not get back and if
anyone try to get you they will die
too

honey please go back
go back and
help everyone get down to the surface

i be not losing you

i can not let you do it
i can not
i be
sorry

woody

i love you terri
god how i love
you

woody nooooooo

woody oh woody please god no

come back terri

he be go

please terri
we need you

okay they be go for the burn and

should be initiate the burn
just about
now


phil
hey phil

we be going in blind
we will deploy
the chute by laptop
i need to get
on the data bus put in a software
patch and try to soften this tin
cane land
i could use you help
with the patch

that be great
good job
hey terri i be wonder
think
maybe we could rig some kind of
seatbelt out of those cargo strap

ray
we have get some new data
just coming in

we just it do not make any sense
we be not sure how to read this

data

yes sir
telemetry report the
have left it orbit and reach the
martian surface

crash

no sir
under power

when

Sixtythree minute after mars
recovery go offline
sir the
graph read like a control descent
but that do not make any

they used the as a lander

it be mcconnell it be get to be
nobody
else could have pull this off
son
of a bitch
they be alive

well

damn right

terri let we see if that oxygen still
be operational
phil you well
check out the
i will take the
hab
if you find lukes

just keep in touch

i be at the main airlock door

enter hab

i have get access
i be going in
terri you okay

yeah
this be going to take awhile to
get back to capacity

appear structurally intact
computer be fried just as we
thought

copy that
i have get bust filter
here clog intake
helluva cleanup
job but so far no major damage

i be in the greenhouse
you well
you well come see this for
yourselves

what be it

jim

luke it be i
jim mcconnell

you be not here

luke it be jim

no no you be not
you can not be
here

you wife be debra
you son be bobby
you be reading treasure island
with he

do not hurt he

phil
terri

jim
i do not understand
you be
not suppose to be here
why be
you here
where be woody

he do not make it luke

oh no

luke what happen here

we fired the radar
it come
they
all die

what come

they all die but i be spare
why
have to be for a reason
then
all of a sudden i know why i be
spare

so somebody would be left to figure
out the secret

luke we still do not understand

come
Comecomecome

be it just i
or be he about two
mealpacks short of a picnic

long term exposure to low gravity
can have an adverse impact on the
brain
he could be suffering from a
form of asphyxia

or maybe he whole crew die and
he be be marooned alone on mars
let we give he time to adjust

Greatgreatgreat

so
let i be sure i understand
this
you ship blow up with all
it supply
then you emptied the
cargo out of the and it be
total on land
you have get no
food no water no spare oxygen
nothing but what i see here

what kinda rescue mission be this

that kind

check it out
new nav board for the

i get four roundtrip ticket
baby right in here

four

terri
i be so sorry
he be a good
man

thanks luke

when there be time we will talk

this way

when i come to and dig myself out
of the sand i faceplate be cracked
leak badly
i barely make it back
to base
it be week before i could
work up the nerve to go back out
there and look for they

renee be the only one i could find
but it do not seem right somehow
to dig just one grave

have it be blowing like this for a
while
we see a big storm from space
but
Micker said it be turning south

if it hold course

this whatever it be this force
you say it come directly out of the
top of the mountain

you do not believe i
that be okay
but i be not crazy jim

what do you mean by it secret

what secret

you well see for yourselves

see where they make they mistake
be they must have planned for it to
be visible from earth

who be they

do not you understand
hundreds of
millions of year have go by
you have
get erosion sand storm lava flow
meteor impact hell in that much
time the whole surface would have
changed
so no wonder we never see
it before
well i mean we see it
but not like they mean we too
too
much dirt on it

see what

this

jesus

what be that

i do not know
but whatever it be
somebody build it
and not we

what about the sound
that signal
you hear before the explosion

good jim good
that be the key

hear the pause
that be what make i
realize it be a pattern a repeating
pattern

mathematical

that be what i think
there be
distinct block in the pattern and
within each block the tone come in
group of three
Threethreethree
for month i struggle to analyze
it trying different construct
then i think about dimension

coordinate

right
three group equal three
dimension
so i tried assign
different graphic value to each
block group and tone
and finally i
get
this

i god
be that what i think it
be


that be a model of

you see it too
thank god
i be
afraid i be just suffering from a
form of asphyxia

so okay so somebody left this
thing here somebody other than
human
but what the hell be it

i guess be it be a signature

selfportrait of whatever species
created the face

but that look human

no way
it be missing the last pair
of chromosome
see

yeah but it be close
damn close

the difference between a man and an
ape be less than three percent of
genetic material
but that three
percent give you mozart
einstein

or jack the ripper

it be be a long day
let we get a
couple hour sleep then tackle this
thing when we be fresh
phil you
first priority will be to get the
motherboard over to the
concentrate on get communication
up first
soon as we have get the juice we will
send a packet to Micker tell they
lukes and that
everything
else that be happen
the rest of we
will take an inventory of supply
see where we stand
okay

mon
there be a pair of scissors in
i medkit

how do you feel

like i just get back i other three
percent

the backup generator be salvageable
and two of the solar panel
i be
pretty sure i can get the oxygen
still back into production too
so
we be not in such bad shape
consider

good work terri

look at that
phils idea of absolute
essential


it be not a signature

what

that noise from the face
it be not
a signature
it be a test

it be asking we for the right answer
it want we to put in the miss
pair of chromosome

but why

to prove that we be human

we fired radar into that thing
concentrate sound wave

which it interpreted as a wrong
answer
yes
it be like a a security
alarm
when it get an incorrect
response it defend itself

so what happen when it get the
right answer

i do not know
but we have get to find
out
can you work this the other way
figure out which tone would be
equivalent to the miss chromosome
then dub they into you recording of
the signal

i think so yes

what about the radar gun
will it
accept that input
can we transmit a
completed signal back to the face

whoa whoa hold on jim
what if
you be wrong
whoever go out
there
i mean what if you be wrong
three people have already die over
that thing

four

terri if we leave here without
get some answer they all die
in vain

we just do not know enough about that
that thing out there to take any
more chance

what be we here for if not to take
chance

this mean we be not alone
it mean
we be on the brink of the great
discovery in mankind history
but
we have still get to prove it
who
know when someone else will get
back here
or if they ever will
you
know what congress be like
they will
say it be too dangerous too much
loss of life let we go back to
unmanned flight
we could be the
last explorer to come here for
decade
we be it guy
we be it

we do not have to go out there
there be
a good way

checking video feed

there

how close do we need to get

i be not sure
maybe we well stop
by that boulder

oh i god

it worked
it worked

check for radiation

normal
seismic
normal
anemometer
steady
no sign of the vortex

i do not know what we do but guy
do that look to you like a hostile
gesture

no
more like an invitation

or another test

luke the fourman rover
do it
still work

how long before it hit

an hour
maybe less

how bad

storm like that
it could go
planetary
and last a year

it will sock we in jim
we will not be
able to take off
if that happen
with what few supply we have get
left
we will starve to death

phil how much long to prep the


maybe fortyfive minute
it will be
tight but we can make it

then there be still time for we to
get out there and back

stay here
continue the repair
if
something go wrong you get out of
here before that storm hit

go back
alone

if we be not back in fortyfive
minute i want you to prep and
launch
look at he armpad
display
that be hour

jim

it be not a suggestion it be an order
you understand

i understand
but

you understand what

if you be not back by i prep
and launch

let we go

phil do you read i

yeah jim
you signal breaking up
a little in the storm but i read
you

we be at the face
we be going to need
a few minute here
same deadline
launch at
with or without we
do you copy

copy that

jim be you sure you want to do
this

i be not sure of anything anymore
but i do not come a hundred million
mile just to turn back in the last
ten foot

surface seem firm and level

roger that
texture be smooth

i have get good foot and no
obstruction
let we check we

it be solid again
we be trapped

do not move
keep this orientation

phil
phil can you still hear i

computer be online
ready to load
software
but guy we be losing
visibility here

guy
jim
luke
terri
be anyone
there

do not leave i

jim what be you do
you will
depressurize

i do not think so

jim seal it

no
that be air going into i suit
not out
look at you own suit
they be not rigid anymore
we have get
pressure in here

above mars atmospheric
that be
impossible

we be millions of mile from earth
and we be inside a gigantic white
face
what be impossible

there be six psi in here
nitrogen and oxygen

otherwise known as air

hey there may be some lethal trace
gass i have not pick up yet or
or
oh the hell with it

be that what i think it be

yeah
it be mars

oh i god

earth when it be still pangaea
before the continent separated

they be we
we be they

we be martian

that be what she mean

oh i god
the cambrian explosion

almost six hundred million year
ago there be a sudden expansion of
life on earth
the first multicelled
plant and animal appear
no one
have ever understood why

they seed earth

in please
can you
i

phil we be here
we read you

thank god
listen this storm be
really
few more minute i can not
you have get to get back to the ship

phil
phil

we be in a ship
this be a ship
and the countdown have already start

he be right

then let we get the hell out of here

jim

jim we get to go

i be not coming with you

what

what be you talking about
we have
get to get home

that be where i be going
do not you
see
that be what all this be for
mcconnell gesture
at the ship around
they
you be right terri
this be an
invitation
to follow they
to follow
they home

i have to go
this be the mission
now
to find out who we be
be not
that why we come here
like maggie
said to stand on a new world and
look beyond it to the next one


you know when you think about it
i be not even suppose to be here
all the accident everything that
get we to this point it be just
it be just
i just know it be right

i be okay
i know what i be do
but
you be running out of time
you have
get to get back to the and get
off this planet
now please go

i once feel like i be taking you
turn
but now i think maybe you be
taking mine
guess i be a little
jealous

thanks for saving i life

i pleasure

i wish woody be here to see this
he would have wanted to go too jim

he be here terri
we would not have
make it without he

take care jim

hey jim

yeah

have a great ride

always do

phil
phil do you read
he be not reading

i can barely read you
let we get the
hell out of here
