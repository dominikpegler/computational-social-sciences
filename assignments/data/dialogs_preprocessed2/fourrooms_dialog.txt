leo the floor be yours

thank you
ted do you ever watch the old
alfred hitchcock show

totally bewilder
at this point
yeah

do you ever see the episode the man
from rio with peter lorre and steve
mcqueen

i do not think so

oh you would remember it all right
in
the show peter lorre make a bet
that steve mcqueen can not light his
cigarette lighter ten time in a
row
now if steve mcqueen can light
he cigarette lighter ten time in a
row he win peter Lorres new car
if he can not he lose he little
finger
norman and chester just make the
same bet
normans putting up he pinky against
chesters mint convertible red
convertible chevy Corvelle that he
can light he zippo ten time in a
row

you guy be drunk

well that go without saying but
that do not mean we do not know what
we be do

i will tell you what i be do

i drive a motherfuckin honda i
sister sold i
you hear what i be
sayin
little white motherfuckin
honda civic
he hold up the
magazine
you see this shit
Hollywoods hot new star next
to americas hot old car

he hand ted the
magazine
now you take a good look at that
machine that this motherfucker over
here be standing next to
that be a
niggerred ragtop chevy
Corvelle
and i love that car moreen
i love hip lip and fingertip
cut to we sittine here celebrating
gettin high drinkin champagne

cristal
when you be drinkin
anything else you be drink
champagne
when you be drinkin
cristal you say you be drinkin
cristal

drinkin cristal
Watchin
Rockin new year eve
when all
of a sudden we flip on steve mcqueen
and peter lorre bein fuckin badass
and i look at this funny motherfucker
over here and i say i would do that
for the Chevelle


and chester reply


oh really


you guy would not be do something
this stupid unless you be drink

i think that pretty much go without
sayin
we would probably chicken out
but when you be fuckedup you do not
lie
you tell the fuckin truth
and
the fuckin truth be i lucky Zippos
going to win i chesters car

why be you do this

thrill of the bet
i be the one with
something to lose here
because i can
pretty near guarantee that i love i
car moreen norman love he pinky

how about you guy you be just going to
sit back and let you friend mutilate
each other

why not
life do not get much more
exciting than this
i mean if norman
be puttin he dick on the choppin
block i would step in because you know
in the morning we would really regret
that
but he pinky
who give a
fuck
i mean theoretically he could
lose that choppin onion tomorrow
life still go on

how about you

i do not care

which bring we to you part in this
little wager

i do not have a part

now ted i old granddaddy used ta
say
the less a man make declarative
statement the less he be apt to
look foolish in retrospect
now
there some inherent obstacle in
this undertake
first of all i be
not some sick fuck like peter lorre
on that show travelin the
countryside collecting finger
we be
all buddy here
nobody want norman
to lose he finger
we just want to
chop it off
so if fate do not smile
on ol norman we will put he finger
on ice and rush i be to a hospital
where in all likelihood be able to
sew it back on

hopefully

eighty percent

we side

so normans protected
he interest
have be look after
i interest
on the other hand have not
i be as
emotionally attached to i car as
norman be physically to he finger
i be putting up a very expensive piece
of machinery on this wager
now if
i lose i lose i have no problem
with that
i be a big boy i know
what i be do
however if i win
i want to win
if norman light his
lighter ten time in a row he be
going to have no emotional problem
about taking i car key whatsoever
but if i win it be not inconceivable
that leo or myself at the last
minute might not be able to wield
the ax
which bring we full circle
to you ted
sober ted
Cleareyed
ted
we want you to be the diceman

helluva night huh ted

i get to get out of here

ted i get a hundreddollar bill
here with you name on it whether
you do what we ask or not just to
sit back down in the chair for one
minute more

i be not going to cut off he finger

maybe you will and maybe you will not
but that have nothing to do with this
hundreddollar bill in i hand
you
can tell we all to go fuck off and
walk right out that door
but if you
sit back down and wait sixty second
before you do it you will be a hundred
dollar rich

ted
take the money

ted you be going to do whatever you
want to do
we be just askin you to
indulge we for another minute more
and chesters willin to pay for it

i will take you money and i will sit
back down
but a minute from now
i be going to walk out the door and
when i do there be no hard
feeling

well i want you to have a bit more
of an open mind than that but yeah
we will either convince you or we will not
no hard feeling
right guy

okay leo you be the timekeeper
let we know when one minute begin
and when it end

you get it
gentleman start you engine

begin

okay pay attention here ted i
be not get much time
now i be going to
make two pile here on the bar
he take the hundred
dollar bill and lay
it out on the bar
one pile
pointing at the
hundreddollar bill
which be yours
and another pile
chester whip out a
money roll fat enough
to choke a horse to
death
which could be yours
he lay a match
hundreddollar bill
on the bar start
a second pile
now what you have to be aware of be
we be going to do this bet one way
he lay another
hundred on the end
pile
or the other
he lay another
hundred on the pile
whether it be you who hold the ax
he lay another
hundred on the pile
or the desk clerk downstairs
he lay another
hundred on the pile
or some bum we yank off the street
he lay another
hundred on the pile

you can buy a lot of soup with that
pile

shhhh i be the close
how much be on the bar already
i
lose count

six hundred

six hundred
ted do you know how
long it take the average american
to count to six hundred

no

laying another bill
on the pile
one minute less than it take to
count to seven hundred
you know
ted a persona life be make up of a
zillion little experience
he lay another bill
on the pile
some which have no meaning be
insignificant and you forget they
and some that stick with you for the
rest of you natural life
he lay another bill
on the pile
bar alzheimers of course
now what we be propose be so
unusual so outside the norm that i
think it would be a pretty good guess
that this will be one of those
experience that stick
so since
you be going to be stick remembering
this moment for the rest of you
life you get to decide what that
memory will be
he lay down the
last bill on the
pile
so be you going to remember for the
next forty year give or take a
decade how you refused a thousand
dollar for one secondes worth of
work or how you make a thousand
dollar for one secondes worth of
work

time

well ted what be it going to be

okay

but when it be over no matter what
happen i get the money

as long as you do you part you can
take the pile walk out the door
and not say another word

let we do it right now before i change
i mind

here here

perfect perfect perfect perfect
this be great
this be a moment in
time none of we will ever forget

norman you ready

ready

ted you ready
