they speak soft
to each other
linda give the boy a glance and evaluate

she wedding band
one of the boy yank Alicias little purse away from she
the other boy fumble the wedding band

car leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform
through the window on the train linda stare at the boy

when a reach out and stop the
car door from close
forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car
there be a muzzle flash
a distant
a cloud of smoke
a mist of blood
and Lindas body collapse on itself
Alicias face shock terror and blood
lots of uniform and light a white
sheet draped over Lindas body where it fell
