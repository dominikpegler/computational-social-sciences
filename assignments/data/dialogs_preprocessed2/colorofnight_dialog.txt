she take a chromeplated revolver in she drawer start to put

so who do you think be the enemy
no no give i a
specific answer
the office be very chic and evidently belong to a very rich new

you be the goddamned enemy capa you and this all tower
of psychobabble
you know what i hope
that god get real
pissed off and he shrivel up you cock so that it point
straight down to hell where you belong


michelle so you will become he avenging angel and
swoop down to finish i off

now i finally get it
you be be like i exhusband
you
think that everything get to be either black or white
because you get colorblind
but god be on i side now
he
know i be not like you

well we be pretty much the same michelle
we all do it

we all do what

tend to view we live as we be looking through a
keyhole
be a very limit view of the truth
so we have
to fill in the blank
we invent thing

i do not know what you mean

you invent enemy to test you strength against
you
invent god to protect you from these enemy

what a depressing view of life you have that be such
horseshit

who be the enemy
one minute you have friend the next
moment they have slipped away
you leave here and i wonder
who be michelle really hate this week
i try to remember
and i can not bring it to mind

i see
there
be nothing much that i really like
i think i prefer the
view outside actually

all right get back there

i god it be the red blood i ever see pour around
she green dress
and
then the red disappeared

hell
and then the red start to fade away

poor capa

hell yes
it do not take sigmund freud to figure out i
do not care to see the color of i patient blood

i be a little surprise that this happen to you

start to stand up
sure
you always think i be a coldhearted son of a
bitch

not really but there be a kind of arrogance here
do you really believe that you be responsible for she
illness
you be a small recent part of she life

yes that be right that be right
but it be all too fuck
glib for i larry
i cannot dispose of this woman that
easily

well you always be a romantic
be you involve with
anyone else

no
i be still a romantic
i just do not have anybody to be
romantic with
they want to fuck i or marry i
none of
they want to love i

maybe you do not want to be loved
you have a happy marriage
once

she loved i to death
then she run off and loved somebody
else to death

of course there be something else here
to deny red be to
deny emotion

i know and i have get
something break

fix

a
motive
three day go by and you do not call we

it be easy if you be here together

oh i see
so even bob death be group therapy
that be

hey bob thank for giving we a chance to grieve
together
shit

what the fuck be going on here
i need to know more

he be stabbed to death

how many time be he stabbed

this man be bob good friend
do you really needed exact
number now

sondra
sondra
sondra
sondra

get you fuck hand off i

it be
it be

it do not make sense to i

many time clark
more than thirty
it be all i can tell
you

it be not a thief i can tell you that right now

i agree

i mean why stab a guy thirty time
bob
he would piss in
he pants if you show he a knife you know that

what be you saying

i be saying sondra that you really really have to hate a
person to stab he that many time
you be a shrink
right
you know what kind of power people hand over a
shrink
or maybe sometimes they hand even more than they
want to

that be absolutely correct
thief would not stick around
and stab someone thirty time

since when do you become such an expert on robbery

it be not the robbery he be an expert on it be the rage

what
what be we going to do now
i mean you
we th
the
group

i bet doctor capa have an idea

what do he mean

i think casey be suggest that i
may have some plan to
replace bob

maybe you should

no
i can not do that
not right now

why

one reason be that i be more screw up than you people
be

i be just be obnoxious and loud before
anybody have a
fuck Xanax

i have a librium

stop with the drug

it would be a good idea if you stay

bob be not cold yet

i mean there be some connection
right

you be bob good friend
you
you seem kind of like he
i will be so much easy to trust you

i know what kind of force a group can become in you life
you tell thing here
intimate thing that
you would not
tell you good friend
i be very flattered that you would
but the truth be
you be the people that make this work
i would be more than happy to try to find someone for you
to continue this but i cannot help you

if i opinion count for anything i would like to ask
why it be you feel so inadequate for the task

maybe he just do not like we

no that be not it buck

why do not you step on something

you stop

six week ago i speak harshly to a patient
and she
commit suicide
right in front of i
perhaps she would have do this anyway
