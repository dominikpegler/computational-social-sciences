the
only bless thing we know be
it will be at the most inconvenient
and unexpected time
just when
you have get ticket to the world
series
and that be the way the
permanent wave

well i be back now
i just wanted
you to know
get to rush

happy to see you looking so good

that fellow could be a congressman
if it be wet you do not fold it
you
shake it and hang it neatly on the
rod provide

yes sir

Whadaya say

hello

roy
welcome back

what be going on
this be usually
coffee break time

not since Kaggs show up

hey yeah i be fine everything
great
what be this Kaggs
sound
like a disease

it be

troubleshooter from the main
office
come out here right after
you go into the hospital and he
be not have a kind word for anybody
yet

nobody know anything but he

he chopped off half a dozen
salesman
will not wholesale to they
any more

what kind of sense do that make
they be all on commission

you think he will chop i

if he do he be crazy

here he come

Kaggs
home office

roy dillon

i know that
know it when i see you
out there
the good salesman here
which be not saying much
want to
talk to you dillon

what be up

that be a pretty backhanded
compliment
if i let people get
away with thing like that i
would not be a good salesman

you be right
i apologize
but i
still want to talk to you

lead on

take a seat

when i said you be the good
salesman here do not say much i
mean for we
i know you record
with Sarber and webb and i would say
you be a topflight man but you have
have no incentive
no one walking on
you heel
just a lot of half
ass so the tendency be not
to stretch yourself
i be bouncing
the slob incidentally

so i hear

make no difference to i if
they be only on commission
if they
do not make good money they be not
giving we good representation and
we can not afford to have they
around
ever supervise salesman

just myself

that be right you have have to
supervise yourself
this place
need a sales manager
somebody
who be prove he be a salesman and
can handle other salesman
he would
have a lot of deadwood to clear
out new man to hire
what do you
think

sound like a good idea

i do not know offhand what you good
year be we can look it up
the
idea be we will top it by fifteen
percent

what
i

that be just the first year
if you
be not worth a lot more than that
the second year i will kick you out
what do you say

well uh
no

no

i can not take that job
i mean i
mean i can not take it right away
