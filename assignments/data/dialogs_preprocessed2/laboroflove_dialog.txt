that may sound peculiar

how far could an individual walk if
they have no athletic train
you understand just an ordinary
person


i know what you be get at

you do


i have see it before

you have


you be feeling old and you want to
start exercise
lot of man
you age feel the need to recapture
they youth
do not feel
embarrass about it

okay


you should start slow and easy
fifteen minute a day

no
how far in one attempt
what be the far someone like
myself could walk

just for curiosity sake that be all


i do not know maybe twenty
mile
of course i be not
recommend that
if someone
like you have to i mean
that be
how far they would probably get before
encounter serious physical
wall

twenty mile
i see


each inch represent mile

making the grand total

damn baby relax
i be get to
it
taking on a rehearse
tone
from philadelphia following the
route highlighted to pacifica
california you be travel an
estimated three thousand two
hundred mile

three thousand mile
how many
time do twenty go into three
thousand

what be that

perhaps there be another route

this be the route approved by
triple
even if you follow
back road the entire way you would
still be looking at roughly the
same distance

do not worry baby it should not take
you more than five day if you just
stop to sleep and eat

by car right

american journal of

valid

how do a grow man who can barely
walk just stroll out
this be
not james bond here this be i
uncle who own a bookstore and
get outwit by grade school kid
pulling prank

mrs
matlin this be sergeant
emory

there be a patient of mine who have
a golden retriever mac
she
loved mac not like a pet but like
a family member
one day she have
to leave mac with friend and
would not you know it mac get away
and end up falling into a sewer
i patient come back go nut
when she hear that mac have be in
the sewer for over hour
apparently the cop who find the
dog do not want to get he pants
dirty
and neither do anyone
else
so of course i patient
decide to go in after it
she
fall
break she hip and land
next to she dead dog who die of
toxic fume down there

the moral of the story be
she
sue for a lot of money
she sue
the friend the city and the
officer for negligence on duty
she have no mac no happiness but
she be very rich now
that be a
dog

if something should happen to i
uncle whom i love more than you
can possibly imagine
now
