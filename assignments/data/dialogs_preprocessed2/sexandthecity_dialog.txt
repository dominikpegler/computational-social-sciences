something we really want
and then
we have to pick a place to meet

the past no longer exist
show up be the promise we make
to each other that we be will to
let it all go and move forward

i have a lot of
think to do

thinking or feeling

what do you mean

miranda you be a lawyer
you can
argue both side of any case
but why we feel what we feel
be not logical
it be emotional
sorry harvard i be afraid you be
going to have to make this decision
base on you emotion

well then i be screw
i do not
know what i feel

you will
there will come a moment
when you will know
and if it be
yes
all that brilliant logic will go
out the window
with the past

and i think picking the place to
meet be a challenge

where be it
