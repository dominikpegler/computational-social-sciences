factory by milwaukee come june

good evening

brother have be slay brother since
cain and abel yet even i do not see
that come
i be as blindsided as poor
henry over there

apparently the authority shared i
naivete and believe the young mane tale
that henry fell and hit he head on a
stone and die of smoke asphyxiation

of course if they have not believe he ed
never would have have the opportunity to
commit the heinous act for which he
become famous
and we would not have we
little movie
instead we would have more
nice safe predictable one like
these


mere technicolor bauble

ah
bit of doom and gloom
now that be
more like it




this thing be going to be gigantic
i
wish i have twenty percent of the take

do tonight incredible reaction
surprise you mr
hitchcock

no when i be planning north by
northwest i could already hear the
scream and laughter
then to a

any question i dear

pity


mr
hitchcock you have directed fortysix
motion picture

see around the world
you be the most
famous director in the history of the
medium
but you be sixty year old

muhammad have the eye of peep toms
gouge out with arrow

talking of arrow do you read mr
Weilers review in the new york time
apparently he find the climax to be
and i quote overdrawn


i doubt whether mr
Weiler have have a
climax in year

and how about this little grenade
north by northwest remind we of
Hitchcocks early more youthfully
inventive spy thriller

and just to drive the nail into the
coffin there be a handy accompany
guide to the new master of suspense

of suspense when they still have the
original

thank god i have a pocketful of
pretzel

i mean you

to apply you considerable prune skill
to this

the most fun i ever have be working with
you

i suppose i could give it a look

anything
anything at all

nothing suitable

need to call alma

gin
mother ruin

boucher say this psycho book by robert
bloch be fiendishly entertain


it sound ghastly
everyone in town
already passed

and who be everyone

the story department finished the
coverage this morning

be this the one base on ed gein the
serial killer

graphic element of brutal violence
voyeurism transvestitism and incest

certainly not you average run of the
mill nutcase be he

you be kidding

peggy

grapefruit later

idea on how you could adapt it

it be elegant sophisticated full of


the book or mr
whitfield cook

leave it on the night stand

there be calory in that you know

oh god

read the bit in the motel bathroom

now

mary start to scream and then the
curtain part far and a hand
appear holding a butcher knife
it
be the knife that a moment later cut
off she scream
and she head

charming
doris day should do it as a
musical

this be nothing but lowbudget horror
movie claptrap

but what if someone really good make a
horror movie


just think of the shock value
kill
off you lead lady halfway through

you be intrigue
admit it

actually i think it be a huge mistake

you should not wait till halfway
through
kill she off after minute


peggy i want you to summon you
minion

minion
certainly
and who might they
be

get they start buying copy of
psycho


how many do you need

all of they
i want every copy
nationwide


have they scour every book shop and
library
psycho be i next picture and
i do not want anyone to find out the
ending until they see it in the theater

all that celeries affecting you brain

be you sure about this
this be so
unlike you

that be exactly the point i dear

and when the wisconsin police department
raid he farmhouse in Plainview


they opened the door only to discover
voila


ten female head with the top sawn
off a dozen mask of human skin and a
pair of lip on a drawstr for a window
shade

be this really going to be you be next
picture mr
hitchcock

that be i intention madam
yes

i only wish he look more like william
holden and less like elmer fudd

be i the only one who find this
offensive

i be hope everyone would
i mean life
be deeply offensive and disgusting be not
it

try the finger sandwich they be real
finger

peggy
i be going to need some research
detailing a typical unmarried yearold
secretary from phoenix arizona



she monthly rent what she wear what
she read which scent or perfume she
prefer

how she deal with a demanding boss
when she be trying to relax on she
weekend off

re
the face of the

i told you hitch
this thing strictly
for the drivein crowd

now if this be a hitchcock picture
what would two character like we
marry to other people be saying

you do not have to pretend you be not
upset he have not read it yet you know

i be a big boy
i can take it

well i loved it
what terrific fun it
must have be to research

certainly more fun than reading those
review


do you think he really will read it

speak of the devil

i have to admit hitch i run all over
town looking for a copy of psycho but
could not find a single one

i wonder how that could have happen

do not stop looking on i behalf

i have see happy face on a school bus
going over a cliff

i told you it would be too much

but they can not stop looking can they

audience want to be shock barney
they want something different
and this
be it

the truth be hitch every time you want
to do something different like the
wrong man or vertigo someone lose
money

so we should stop trying to give they
something new

you owe paramount one last picture
hitch
can not you do something like north
by northwest but for we this time instead
of for

we have offered you dozens of perfectly
good property

psycho


no one respect the name hitchcock more
than paramount
but even a talented man
sometimes back the wrong horse


be you telling i no


i think you know i good than that
hitch
i would never say no to you

what a putz
you know what he family do
before they build those movie palace
run a grocery store

i father run a grocery store

exactly
that be what i be saying
he
should show some respect

they think i have lost i touch lew
i association with television have
cheapen i

be you refer to that deal i get you
where BristolMeyers pay you twentynine
grand an episode and you own the
negative
that be i kind of cheap

they just want the same thing over and
over
they have put i in a coffin and now
they be nail down the lid

hitch i will never let that happen


how much do you think you can make this
picture for

eight hundred thousand
give or take

i have whisky in the car

you be back early

i be disappoint you do not give Whits
book a chance

what about he

he know you well enough

enjoy the pool now
we might not have it
for that much longer

why


paramount refuse to finance the movie
imagine the studio that bring you
martin and lewis and the great show on
earth consider psycho distasteful

lew can not find the money
not quickly
enough at least

why not wait

we be going to have to go it alone old
girl
we will finance the movie ourselves

be we going to have to sell the entire
house or just the pool

tell i and i will not ever ask again
why
this one hitch
it be not just because so
many people be telling you no be it

hitch

remember the fun we have when we start
out and there be so little money and
time
we take risk we experiment
we
invent new way of making picture
because we have to



i want to feel that kind of freedom
again

barney we be about to propose a
restructure deal for psycho

we finance it
independently
paramount
only distribute it
in exchange for
percent of the profit

interesting
but tell we what exactly be
paramount distributing
be this still a
picture about a queer kill people in
he mother dress

what this picture be about be the
reputation of alfred hitchcock

noone argue that

barney it be very simple
this be mr
Hitchcocks next film
be you in or be
you out

well obviously you have a lot of passion
for this project
let i talk it over
with a few people internally and i will get
back to you


no
now

fine
we will take that deal
if you can
get the money

we have already get it barney

who do i make it out to

if this picture fail alma we will be in
for a long humiliating bout of crow
eat

the movie will be splendid

be you sure

of the movie
not in the least
but of
you
unquestionably

joe stefano
good to meet you


sorry i be late
i shrink session run
overtime
i see he every day and it be
still not enough

i think only director assistant
needed psychiatrist not writer

do you see a shrink mr
hitchcock

no

i must say it boggle the mind to imagine
what you and you shrink could possibly
talk about daily

the usual
sex
rage
i mother

there be still the federal income tax
payment
the property tax
not to
mention the absence of any salary while
he be actually making the film

stop waffling donald
give it to i
straight


hitch be not exaggerate
if the film
a flop you be going to have to sell the
house

where do you suggest we cut

anywhere you can

i get joe stefano to write out the first
few scene
why do not you take a look

we be about to have dinner
you do not
need anything else

well

hire he


the only thing bad than a visit to the
dentist be one to the censor

whatever you do alfred do not lose you
temper

the code will absolutely not permit you
to show a knife penetrating a woman
flesh

i assure you geoffrey i murder be
always model of taste and discretion

be there any improper suggestion of
nudity in this murder scene in the
shower

she will not be nude
she will be wearing a
shower cap


we might accept a shot from outside the
bathroom window with marion in silhouette
above the shoulder provide the glass
be frosted

then this scene with the toilet

it be completely necessary
marion flush
evidence later find by she sister
it be
a clue to the girl disappearance

no american movie have ever find it
necessary to show a toilet let alone
to flush it

perhaps we ought to shoot the film in
france and use a bidet instead

mr
hitchcock if this office deny you
a seal and we be certainly heading in
that direction you movie will not be
released in a single theater in this
country
will you be making joke then

good
now why do not we go all the way
back to page two



everyone in hollywood resent i
i make
they millions
and yet every year i sit
at those dreadful award show dinner
waiting for they to say just once
you be good


they take sadistic pleasure in deny i
that one little moment

that must hurt

deeply

you will have to excuse i doctor
i be not
used to this
process

take you time

it be just that more and more lately
i have be have these
impulse

what kind of impulse

strong one



send they all back to glendale

the lazar office tell i he be crazy to
work with you


well tell swifty he should not have
overexposed he client on television

unlike certain people we could mention

think of the duality he could bring to
norman
the rage lurking behind that
littleboylost grin
the winsome charm
he use to keep from be find out

why alma you be not suggest that mr
perkins be


i can not count how many time i have see
stranger on a train and rope

well norman be the logical extension of
the boy in those movie
appealing
sensitive suffer the terrible burden
of be forced to pretend to be
something he be not

i only worry be that playing norman
might cut too close to home

how so


i be incredibly close to i mother
so
close i remember wish i father would
drop dead
and then when i be five he
do just that
he keel over from a
heart attack
you see i have be guilty i whole life
mr
hitchcock

try to remember this be all just make
believe

not to be prudish but how far do you
plan to push normans relationship with
he mother

further/far than you can possibly imagine

i be get blister just looking at you

stop grumbling
bit of fresh air and
exercise be exactly what you need


if i could get grace kelly to play the
girl they would let i get away with
anything

well you can not
she be a princess now
which make she permanently unattainable

and all the more desirable

lew suggested deborah kerr

too
scottish

what about janet leigh
she be always the
good girl but she do awfully well in
touch of evil
lew mention she name
do
you remember how you always remark on
she figure at the Wassermans party



of course the real secret of mrs
simpson appeal to the duke of windsor
be that she could make a toothpick feel
like a cigar

you know i have be so immerse in
preparing to play marion i would almost
forgotten how to laugh

now you must try the banana shortcake

nothing for i thank you
i be watch
i figure

you be not the only one
we be fine thank you

bring she the banana shortcake george
in fact make it two large portion

so do tell i how else have you have
prepared to play marion

i have written a complete history for
she
it seem silly but it help i



it do not sound silly at all
tell i
one of she deep secret

she lead a double life
for instance
when she work at the lowery office she
wear tweed perfume
but when she and
sam be together she recklessly break
out she one expensive bottle i sin
by lanvin

but
i do have a concern or two
i be an
actress but i be also a wife and mother
first so i be wonder just how you will
do that shower scene

you and the Shurlock office

it be just
i mean even if you shoot i
from here
she indicate a spot just
above she bosom
well it be not as if i figure be
boyish

allow i to put you mind at rest

may i show you some of mr
saul Basss
marvellous story board

i plan to shoot quick bit of film from
various angle



cut together this montage will suggest
nudity and violence but nothing will
actually be show

and have you in the shower will make it
all the more titillate

if you will excuse i

oh come off it old girl

alma dear how lovely to see you

hello lillian

you be looking a little pale
no wonder
with that thing you husband working on
now
you can not possibly approve

why be you letting he do something so
tasteless


do not upset yourself darling
it be only
a bloody movie

i have make a list of place where we can
tighten we belt

it would not hurt for we all to learn the
art of self restraint

the gardener only once a week and
weekend off for the driver
no
absolutely not
we will find other place
to cut

there be not any other place
and
furthermore they will be no more shipment
from maxim either
we can not afford it

the foie gras at Chasens be more than
adequate

but those goose be from barstow not
marseilles


we all have to make we little sacrifice
for the great good do not we alfred

stay here
i be going to get the knife

help i

ed
ed


ed
ed


be i making a mistake

what if it be another vertigo

oh shut up
just get the first take
under you belt you will be fine

i still can not believe you cast vera miles
as the sister

i have still get she under contract
i may
as well get something out of it

rather a thankless role do not you think

for an utterly thankless girl


Shurlocks office called again
they want
to know when you will be making the change
to the script

the more we frustrate they the more they
interest will wane



break it to i gently

lesbian librarian

re
the fabric
he choose it himself and have it imported
from paris

if i wear that i be going to look like
george washington

wait until you see the undergarment he
picked out for you

i just have to keep telling myself one
more picture and i be free as a bird

be there a fan blowing somewhere

many secret of psycho

that i will not divulge the plot nor the
many secret of psycho

to friend relative trade reporter or
columnist not even to outgoing
president dwight
eisenhower god bless
he


now hitch explain to i why i be
watch marion undress

i feel like i should take offense at
that

i do not know
perhaps as a boy norman
secretly watch he mother preparing for
she nightly bath

maybe there be a transom over the
bathroom door

yes one he could access with a chair
so long as he be stealthy

well a boyo first glimpse of a naked
woman be usually he mother


so
i be relive the past repeating a
ritual with marion

you be the actor
you figure it out

hitch i have a question
why be the hole
much large on this side

all the good to see you at the great
possible angle i dear

wow
you really do you research do not
you

it be just i jesuit work ethic

the truth be
i be only happy when i be
work

and if i be not working then i be
nothing
i be not even a person
i be just
a collection of molecule
useless
cylinder of ugly flesh




what about you mother
let we go back to
she

i mother
yes

she be an extraordinary person
she
exposed i to ibsen strindberg shaw
she hope i would go into engineering
carry a lunch pail gold watch at fifty



she do not approve of you career

to she movie people be akin to thief
and prostitute

if i misbehave she would make i stand at
the foot of she bed and discuss how i
planned to become a good boy



have you ever considered that you deep
desire to gain the approval of you
industry represent a textbook case of
transference
the oscar be you mother

you be a fine one to talk


you will be wearing a white bra like this
for the open scene on the bed
and
then after you have stolen the money

i switch to one of these

be you sure you do not want to look at
something a little more elegant

no
they have to look like they be
buy at sears and roebuck
i want every
woman in the audience to look up at janet
have sex with john gavin and think
that could be i

this be the brand i wear

we be ready for a fit



we travel across the rooftop of downtown
phoenix and finally through the heat
pick out a certain hotel window

we go under the blind and match dissolve
into the room itself



we pan over and discover john and janet
on the bed

she will be wearing only she undergarment
and a large glow of satisfaction


cut

good luck get this one past the
censor

you girl go on ahead

if you ask i the credit should read
screenplay by joseph stefano and alma
Reville


the people who matter know
that be all
that count

i would hate to see Shurlocks face when he
read this

alma you always know the answer
be this
really going to work

hello stranger

whit

where have you be hide yourself

the noise coming from the Shurlock
office

i should not be in a position of just
hear thing hitch
it be time you
show i some footage

why


to see if you be making a picture
paramount can actually release

as you well know barney i contract
guarantee i final cut

you contract also say paramount be not
required to distribute any film that
could because we embarrassment

unlike the last five martin and lewis
picture you be all so proud of



i demand to see some footage hitch

connect i to maxim of paris

yes it be alfred hitchcock in hollywood
california JeanClaude
i need three
pound of foie gras send on the next
flight out
that be correct

those steak have not changed at all have
they

it be so nice not to have to take care of
someone even if it be just for an hour or
two

whit where be we going
you still
have not tell i

i have a little surprise

surprise
how fun

what happen to you driver

i have be asking myself the same thing

i can give you a ride if you want

do you know adolf hitler sketch the
design for this car on ferdinand
porsches cocktail napkin in a berlin
beer garden

i do not

it be only now that i truly appreciate
just how diabolical herr hitler be

may i

help yourself
i pinched they from Tonys dressing room

so this be what they eat at the drive
in

i think you only eat fauchon chocolate

need must when the devil drive i
dear


i do not mind that he use he obsession
to fuel he art
i just do not like it
when he use it against i

he be like any great artist
impossible to
live with but worth the effort
he throw a rock into the

van gogh be not exactly a walk in the
park either

do you know when we start out i be
he boss
he do not even dare ask i out
until he would worked he way up to assistant
director

what do you think of that place over
there

look nice
terrific location
why

it be mine

i just see elizabeth
why on earth do not
she tell i

she do not know about it


so what do happen between you and vera

i be going to make she star
but she
choose the life of a housewife

i cast she as the lead in vertigo
then
two week before film she told i be
pregnant

why do they do it
why do they always
betray i


i be just leasing it for the offseason

place to get away from the wife and kid
and write

very bohemian

you might find that room interesting

whit
i hope you have not get the wrong
idea


if you be serious about helping i
adapt i book i think it would be the
perfect hideaway


so i read you finish treatment
taxi
to where be it

dubrovnik

that be it
dubrovnik
care to hear i
opinion

yes
naturally


there be no other way of saying it
it be
stillborn
dead in the water

how so

the plot a muddle
some of the joke
be awfully like thing we already do
well hundreds of year ago in the lady
vanish
and you villain be weak
but
the big failure be the relationship
between the hero and heroine

if you be not so smite with you
friend whitfield cook you would probably see
that

woman never really care to face the truth
when they heart be involved do they

how would you know what really go on
between a man and a woman

look at this mess

bloody belttightening




tell the boss we be ready

hour ago

and you be sure this moleskin will stay
put

i be going to be taking a
shower all week

forget what hitch said
he be just feeling
he age
he will come around

but he be right
it do need more
feel

so why do not we put some in

all we need be a good catalyst
some
innocuous little trigger to release all
that underlie desire

be make up of many shot from mr
Basss

salary

scene

one seventy three

storyboard

start with the overhead
we will cut before
the fall
then we will put martin in a
chair under the camera

and that lens should be a thirtyfive



you forget to look in the bathroom

man like you
missing the vital clue
like that

what do you mean

i mother always said if you be going to
do a job do it right

check the floor

closer


you still think they be just writing
together


so what be you going to do about it


barney

alma

you know david kirkpatrick
he be work
on jerry lewis next picture

so he be free to help
if you need it

that will not be necessary

but you be nearly three day behind


alma
we both know what kind of film this
be
the smart thing to do would be to help
hitch finish it

thank you for you concern barney

but on a hitchcock picture there be only
one director

mrs
hitchcock

i hope you do not mind
i hear hitch be
sick so i get he a little something

that be kind of you

well he be be very considerate with i
i have not always have that from i
director

janet you have be very
professional
it have not go unappreciated


may i turn that down

you will be please to know order have be
restored

thank you would be nice

we be still two day behind and sixty
thousand over budget

i already cancel the wrap party
Thatll save we two thousand right there
and you will not be tempt by any champagne
and cake

beware all man be potential
murderer

with good reason


alright what be this about

spending a lot of time at the beach

that be where whit and i be writing
he be
rented a place

hardly the ideal set to avoid
distraction

actually it be very conducive to creative
collaboration

i already told you that treatment be a
waste of time

do not everyone say the same thing about
psycho

be you and whit have an affair

do not be absurd
he be working on
something new and need a little help
that be all

what a coincidence
i be working on
something new and i could use a little
help too

what do you think i have be do



then why be you spending all hour of
the day and night with some overage
talentless mamma boy

because it be fun

i be under extraordinary pressure on
this picture the least you can do be
give i you full support

full support
we have mortgaged we house
i house

might i remind you that i have weighedin
on every aspect of this film so far as i
have do on every picture you have do in
the last three decade
and the first
time you show the film it will be i
note that you want
i celebrate with you
if the review be good and i cry for you
if they be not
i host you party and
put up with those fantasy romance with
you lead lady
and when you be out
promoting this film around the world i
will stand beside or rather slightly
behind you smile endlessly for the
press even when i be ready to drop being
gracious to people who look through i as
if i be invisible because all they can
see be the grand and glorious alfred
hitchcock


now for the first time in year i dare
to work on something that be not an
alfred hitchcock production and i be meet
with accusation and criticism
this work
i be do with whit give i pleasure and
purpose



and even though that take absolutely
nothing away from you please consider
this a reminder
i be you wife alma
Reville not one of the contract blonde
you badger and torment with you ohso
specific direction


free at last

thanks rita


wipe off she makeup
with a kleenex
hello hitch

well vera
you always make it look so
easy

oh it be nothing hitch
i just fake
it

well i guess this be au revoir

why do not you stay with i
i would have
make you as big a star as grace kelly

unlike grace kelly i can pick up i dry
clean
i have get a family hitch

home
that will always mean more to i
than all of this
that blonde woman of mystery you be
after
she be a fantasy
she do not
exist

there be a time when i think i
understood you so completely
understood woman


alma i think you be coming later
tonight

i think you rent this place so we
could write

i do
i swear this just happen

you will not say anything will you

do not worry
i will not tell elizabeth

i mean to hitch

we can not all be genius


alma you be incredibly talented
but
after all
we want he to read the
script with an open mind

oh i would not worry about that whit

you be going to have to cut all that
nudity

what nudity
it be suggested

i definitely see that knife jab she

we do no such shot

i would stake i reputation on it
i be
recommend you cut the shower scene
entirely


i will go over it frame by frame and set up
another screen

what be the verdict

let we just say it be a fourletter
review and it be not good

screw he
it be too late for paramount to
back out no matter what balaban say

the other route be to recut it as a two
parter for the series
because of the
budget and the hitchcock name we stand a
good chance of breaking even

look i make jimmy stewart a millionaire
of winchester and that be a dog
at
least i could sit through you picture

more importantly what do alma think

be there anything else we can do


we will just have to wait and see how the
movie turn out

well it be only a house



this be i favorite place
i just shut
the door and leave the world behind

pass i that bag will you

do not you get lonely out here sometimes

i can always talk to i mother


that be strange



jesus christ

i think we find he hide spot

they can not go in there
that be i
mother room



they can not go in there
that be i mother room

an odd little movie
of course colbert
be wonderful

how be the beach

cold and miserable


just like barney Balabans face

whit be not worth a damn when he be not
working with you
and neither be i

i do not pull off the picture this time
it just sit there refuse to come to
life
there be no other way to say it
it be
stillborn

i let you down i love

you deserved well

i will go and feed geoffrey and stanley
shall i

i do not think i can stand both of we
be maudlin

there be one solution to all this you
know

we could both get to work together

that tiresome little hitchcock imitation
i have be helping whit finish be do

so i suggest for everyone sake we
start whipping psycho into shape
tomorrow
you may not be the easy man
to live with but you know how to cut a
picture good than anyone

except for you

you will need to cut those six or seven
frame where she blink after she be
suppose to be dead

we have see the footage a thousand time
she do not blink

take thirty frame off the head

no no the second take the light be
well on he hand

only cut back to janet once the care
already moving

cut it tight
the minute i lose one
person i have lost the whole audience


you imp
you get nudity in there

she breast be very large dear
it be
a challenge not to show they

i will be damn
she do blink

how be it going in there with mr
herrmann

swimmingly

everyone saying it be a dog with flea



absolutely not

i do not want music in the shower
murder

but what alma and i talk about be
really going to play

no
this be not vertigo bernie
this be
different
the image have to work on
they own


you can not scare people just by going
boo
you have to tell they what be
coming make they anticipate it


thank god we have get Cinderfella for the
holiday


what do you think

i think i be never going to take a shower
again

hitch

it be get there


i told you i distinctly see both the
stab and the nudity
we be deny
you seal mr
hitchcock

i take you opinion very seriously
but
what you think you be seeing be purely
informed by the power of suggestion
i
assure you that once you view the final
version with mr
Herrmanns lovely
lyrical score

lyrical score will not change i
opinion
all that innuendo and halfnaked
groping really hitch

would you mind if we have a word in
private geoffrey

i have a modest proposal to make
if
you be will to leave the shower
sequence as it be i will reshoot the
open love scene to you exact
specification

in fact i would welcome you personal
supervision on the set

i specification

if only audience could fully appreciate
how tirelessly you work to help we
entertain they while protecting they from
filth and indecency

he be be harass you since you
announced this project you invite he to
the set and he do not even show up
what do you tell he

that i respected he
deeply

lady and gentleman that be a wrap
thank you all

i think we be reshooting the scene

no need
the charade be over

see i be not that much of a monster to
work with be i

not at all

i just hope i be sufficiently loyal to
the because

worthy of a purple heart i dear


i hope you do not mind i told mrs
bates
she could have you dressing room


we have we seal from Shurlocks office
now we lead the lamb to the slaughter

the front office confirmed
they be only
opening the movie in two theatre as we
suspect
and no premiere
if we do not
get word of mouth we be dead

then we would well get start
peggy take
a memo

we be going to write a manual on exactly
how to sell psycho



i first instruction to theater owner
hire pinkerton guard to strictly enforce
we unique admission policy



furthermore because psycho be so
terrifying and unique the guard can
help you deal with customer who run
amok



post we special lobby clock to remind
audience of the start time for
psycho



the manager of this fine motion picture
theater have be advise not to allow
anyone to enter the theater once psycho
begin




should you be so foolish as to attempt to
slip in by a side entrance

a fire escape or through a skylight
you will be eject by brute force

more playful darling



to **further/far emphasize the sheer
unrelenting shock and suspense of psycho
right after the close title
we strongly recommend that you close you
house curtain over the screen for a full
thirty second


by do so the horror of psycho will
be indelibly etch in the mind and heart
of you audience



absolutely never ever will i allow
anything to follow psycho no preview
of coming attraction no newsreel no
short subject and certainly no double
feature
sincerely and emphatically
alfred hitchcock


at the end of the day it be a minor
hitchcock movie
one week and it will be
go

like a bad dream


well at least there be some people
here


we can go through the side entrance


right this way mr
and mrs
hitchcock

ready for the gallows

we have roped off some seat for you

you go on ahead

be you sure

i will join you in a minute

i want to double check the print

fine darling
i will save you a seat

but they be laughing too much




mr
hitchcock how do it end

i promised mother i would not tell

mr
hitchcock what do i do now that i
wife will not take a shower after seeing
you movie

have she drycleaned

i just get off the phone with balaban
i
could not resist telling he we be sell
out for the next two week

what do he say

he said tell hitch congratulations

well deserve triumph as we always know


as we always know


do this mean i can take the weekend off
now

i be sorry mr
Hithcock but there be
photographer outside
they hear you
be here



this could be the big hit of you
career alfred

we career alma

i have realized i will never be able to find
a hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you

you do realize i have be waiting decade
to hear you say that

and that madame be why they call i
the master of suspense




guess what i be do this weekend

what

claudine and i be driving to chicago
with she folk to see that psycho movie

i think you be the happy guy i have ever
known ed
how you do it

i will tell you
you live you life and
it be unbearable sometimes but there be
this secret chet
a big secret no one
else know or want to tell
there be a god and he be so big and
powerful he do not always remember
you be there

but if you can get he attention and
he see you be suffering he will notice
and he will take care of you
i mother
used to tell i she be passed god
bless she the one thing god truly
love and understand be suffering

after all he invent it



and so gentle viewer psycho the
picture everyone predict would bring i
to wrack and ruin be such a hit that
alma and i get to
well let we just say
that we get to keep we house and the
swim pool
and the same critic who
despised it go on to call it one of i
great achievement

of course for i it be just another
moovie


but you know what they say in hollywood
you be only as good as you last
picture
so now if you will excuse i i
must toddle off to begin the exhaustive
search for i next project

unfortunately i find myself once again
bereft of all inspiration
i do hope
something come along soon

good evening
