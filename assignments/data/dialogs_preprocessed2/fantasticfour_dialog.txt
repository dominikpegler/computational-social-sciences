shooting script

high open space exposed structural
element
obviously aim at first
time visitor to create feeling of
smallness inadequacy

good thing it be not workin
reed
what be we do here
this guy
fastfood stripmall science

this be not we first stop in case
you forget
and victor not
that bad
he be just a little
large than life

he be finance some of the big
breakthrough of this century

you would never know it

jesus
that too

reed richards and ben grimm to see

executive elevator top floor

what be the price for a smile round here



i research suggest that exposure to
a highenergy cosmic storm born on
solar wind might have trigger the
evolution of early planetary life

in six week another cloud with the
same elemental profile will pass
earth orbit
study in space could
advance we knowledge about the
structure of the human genome and
help cure countless disease extend
human life

give kid the chance to be strong
healthy less prone to

turn it off
please

but i have not fully explain i

yes you have
imagination
creativity
passion
those be
always you trademark

but dream do not pay the bill do
they
same old reed the hopeless optimist
still reaching for the star with the
world on you back

you remember in school we talk about
working together
that be what i be
about to explain

so it be not i money you want
it be
i toy
tell i
if do not
trust you why should i

that be i job
to stay a step ahead
to know what other man do not

i can not take this

ben
this be business
just work



he be right ben

it be just business

i think you both know i director of
genetic research susan storm

Heya susie
one more thing he be get

ben it be be too long

you be you have i mean how have you
bee

never well

this be not going to be a problem be
it

not at all

ancient history

good
then you be just in time to
hear the great reed richards ask i
for help
you know you make a lot of folk at
feel like a junior high science
fair
so you will excuse i if i savor
the moment

you back this mission and i will sign
over a fair percentage of any
application or

the number seventyfive
and it be
application and patent

what about he first born

ben the money not important
we
could save live

twentyfive percent of a billion be
enough to keep the light on be not
it
maybe even pay off you fourth
mortgage on the baxter build

deal

well then to we future
together

funny how thing turn out be not it

hilarious

if reed right then this little trip
will double we stock offering

and if he be not

reed always right
good thing he
do not always know what he be get

he know about
what if he make
the call to shut we down

ben think about all the people we can
help if this works

maybe you should think about yourself
for once
you always let this guy
push you round

we get what we wanted
that be
enough

i know i know
i be just worry
about what he want
speaking of
which

you sure about this reed

those solar wind be flaring but i
factore they into i coordinate and

i be talking about we
work
together

well uh base on we history
you
can handle the biogenetics and i will
focus on the molecular physics
or
uhm maybe i should take the biotech
you work the microscope since you
have some background in electropho

right
that be exactly what i mean

way to not overthink it
so when do we leave

i will schedule the launch
call i in
the morning to talk about resource
and crew

i uh think i remember the number

it be be changed

as far as crew i be hope ben could
pilot the mission

well he be welcome to ride shotgun
but we already have a pilot on we
payroll
you remember i brother
johnny

can not do it
i cannot do it

external SRBs orbital system engine
it just like the shuttle you fly
in

no
i cannot take order from that
underwear model
that wingnut washed
out of for sneak two victoria
secret wannabe into a flight
simulator

youthful high spirit

they crashed it into a wall
flight
simulator

i be sure he be mature since then

when have i ask you to do something
you absolutely said you could not do

five time

wow
fantastic

material make from selfregulating
unstable molecule
i have be working
on a formula for this

great mind think alike



guess some think fast than other

i hired armani to design the pattern
these color will look great on
camera

they be ready for you sir

money in i sleep

then what be it

history leonard
history
everything else be conversation
how be the other matter

harry winston send he regards

today we stand on the edge of a new
frontier
in the far depth of
outer space
we will find the secret
to inner space
the final key to
unlock we genetic code lie in a
cosmic storm

be not that you speech

he be make a few change

this be you dream reed
you should
be the one up there

victor well at these thing

i will be watch over you

you
you bring he back in one piece or
you can forget be good man

what the hell you smile at
just
keep you mouth shut and you mind on
those SMBs

actually the engine be sme
Hydrogenbase carbon propellant
couple generation past you last
ride
i be not as dumb as you look

think of a world without genetic flaw
no asthma allergy baldness
breast cancer

what be wrong with be bald

darwin discovered evolution
now we
i will define it
only in america
could



a little country boy from Latveria
build one of the big company in
the world and truly reach the star
now if you will excuse i history
await

a dad voice
to ben
if you behave maybe next time
daddy let you drive

keep talking there will not be a next
time

long way from the projection booth at
the hayden planetarium be not it

yes
yes it be

to ground
via commlink
leonard how be the feed



record sir
we see you perfectly

we can monitor the cloud approach
and observe the test from here

be it safe

the shield on the station should
protect we

should

what be wrong ben
Eightymillion
dollar worth of equipment not enough
for you

let we start loading those sample
get you suit ready ben

so you still do all the heavy lift

maybe you should have stay back in
the lab
field work never suited you

he do the talk
i do the
walk
get it

get it
so take a walk ben
i be
going to borrow susan for a second

sure

sue i have live i life unafray of
taking big step
and this be the
big step yet
if it help think
of this as a promotion
merger of
sort
four little word that can change we
live

the cloud be accelerate

i do not know what happen

we have get minute until it hit not
hour
victor that storm deadly
the radiation lethal
we need to
abort

get a grip
reed
we do not come all
this way to lose we nerve at the
first little glitch
just close the
shield

bens still out there

so reel he in
but we come here to
do a job
so let we do it
quickly

ben we need you back inside

i be not do arrange you flower
egghead

give i the god damn mirror

unfortunately the doctor just
could not do anything to fix you face

nice do
go for the grandpa
look

you have be accused in the past of
moving science a little too fast

accuse by who
i competitor

but surely this accident give you
pause

danger be always part of discovery
what would have happen if ben
franklin never go out in a storm
without risk there be no reward

so where be the reward
you promised a
cureall

and you will have it
i have never come
up short
and i be not going to start
now

so you be still taking public

yes of course
i have never be more
confident in the compan

how be she do

stable
vital be strong

blood panel show no irradiation
good
you will step up this protocol
every

four hour
we know what we be
do
one more day of observation
then you be all clear

sue
i want to tell you

be the good part of we relationship

which be

passion

for science

you be such a dork reed
you never
get it and never will unless it be
explain to you in quantum physics

what
what do i say

it be never what you say
it be what
you do not say
what you do not do

i
i
i just wanted to

radioactive energy most likely some
kind of nucleotide compoun

what happen on the bridge
do it
hurt to stretch
be you really on
fire
be it true that one of you can
fly

work on it

doctor have a look at you



victor
what be you do here

i be starting to wonder the same
thing
how much do you know about
what happen to you

not much
we need to run test to see
the extent of the damage

well let i know if there be anything
i can do
we be all in this together
now

victor wait
i just wanted to say
i be sorry the mission do not go as
plan

do not go as planned
it be a
catastrophe
you ruined the live of
four people

i ruined
with all due respect i
told you to abort

abort
reed i put i company i
name billions of dollar on the line
and i will not let you make i look
like a fool

victor if we could understand what
happen to we

i do not want to understand it
this
be not one of you science project
i
just want to fix it
fast



there a problem vic

no problem ben

just pay you goddamn electric bill
and get to work on a cure

you get a chisel round here

if we be going to identify the source
of the mutation we need to isolate
you recombinant so we can
activate positional genome

we need to give you a physical so we
know what get zapped

well why do not you say so
you want
i to lift some weight or something

no just sit back
we have a good
sense of you strength from the
firetruck
we need to find the source
of you strength

how bad be it
you know i used to
smoke

okay this might smart a little

we will
continue this later

back it down johnny

i can go hot

you be really cramp i style here

you be at kelvin
any hot
you be approaching supernova

sweet

that be the temperature of the sun

not only could you kill yourself but
you could set fire to earth
atmosphere and destroy all human life
as we know it

Gotcha
okay
supernova bad

he cooked the equipment

okay
i have uh get some question
from sue
that she think might be
well coming from i
can you you
know go to the bathroom
like
normal

yeah
you do not want to know the detail

ben i be afraid i have get to ask

not unless you want that clipboard
stretched up you

okay
we will skip that question

be there something about flame
about flaming that you

what be you trying to say
just
because i dress well and like to dance

what
no
i be trying to figure out
why we each end up with different
symptom

oh well that be easy
i be hot
you be
well you be a little limp
sue easy to see through
and bens
always be a hardass
why be not you writing this down

it be not invisibility per se
you be bending the light around you
with some kind of malleable force
field
that be what you projected on
the bridge

what about you
you have not eat in
day
how come you be never on this
side of the microscope

bruise
from the bridge

have you have any sideeffects from
you power

i have have some headach
migraine

you should be able to bend light
around other object even people if
you could control you emotional state
well

excuse i

i be saying if you have a little more
self control you could locate the
trigger
can you remember the exact
emotion when

anger
rage
frustration

okay
be there any way to duplicate
that feel
some memory or

i be sure i can come up with something

how be that coming whoa

i be sorry i be sorry i do not mean to
do that
you must think that be
some kind of latent hostility or

what in the world would give i that
idea

i mean you broke up with i right

be you kidding

no i distinctly remember
you walk
out i door
ergo

reed
i be ready for the next step
you be not ergo i walk

i think it be a little more
complicate than

i just wanted to share an apartment
what be so complicate about that

there be a lot of variable to
consider

no
there be not
there be you
and i
no variable no math
it
be actually the simple thing in the
world
but you head get in the way
like it always do

sue
i just
i think

same old reed
too much think

okay guy we have a serious problem



we uniform be exposed to the storm
like we
so they can transform like
we becoming invisible changing size
on demand or remaining impervious to
flame

you look like an eighties rock band

the suit will stretch
you should try
it

i would not be catch dead in that

he be right
these costume be
missing something
i can not put i
finger on it

they be not costume

we be not taking they out
johnny we
need to stay here till we have stabilize

i be get sick of be trapped
here
be not even this strict

maybe it be missing a utility belt



so what be the prognosis

you tissue you organ you entire
biophysical structure be changing
every system be still functioning
somehow

and they be changing into

i do not really know
compound
organicmetallic alloy
strong than
titanium or carbon steel
harder than
diamond

like the shield reed said would
protect we
how long

at this rate the infection should be
complete in two maybe three week

what do you mean complete

i wish i could tell you
i can not
pretend to know what we be dealing
with here
i will notify the and

what

the center for disease control
if
this thing be contagious

look at i
i have a life
i be the
face of a billiondollarcompany
we
need to keep this confidential
understand

but
this disease
be progressive
degenerative

that be terrible news

but i think i will get a second
opinion

nothing
nothing
nothing

of course
of course
the cloud

what be you do

the plant from space
they
particle be still charged
with the
right amount of energy those ion
could create the elemental profile of
the cosmic storm

if we can build a machine to recreate
the storm we can reverse the polarity

and reverse the mutation

cure countless disease not just
ours

but we be the focus right reed
reed

of course
of course

and you sure you can control this
thing
last time do not work out so
well

preoccupy mind
spin
with the right energy we can
stabilize the storm
maybe tie into
the city grid

you really need to get a janitor

this must be what it look like inside
you head

there be a system to it

wait
sue do not touch tha

sorry
i fault
i will not
touch
anything

be reed any close to a cure

the only thing he be close to be
sue

make i a reservation for two at
cipriani tonight

and get this over to ben grimm



close you eye baby
keep they
close



you surprise

yeah i be surprise
surprise the
fire department do not shut this down

god
i be good looking

what do you wish for honey

i already get it
everything i want



damn stretch

how fare that rubber bend

that be what i be trying to calculate
and it be not rubber
it be muscle
tendon
i seem to have the ability to
manipulate the malleability of i
molecular structure and redistribute
i density to

right whatever have fun

that be not funny

hey that be ben grimm there the first
mook from brooklyn to go to outer
space so pay he some respect

ernie
sorry for killing you
business
i will take the usual then
i be out
well make it a double

who killed the party



make it a triple
on the house
benny

if there be a god she hate i

i do not think she be real big on hate

you would not say that if you could
see i

can i
see you

just do not

susan
what be you do

you think i bring you here to talk
about we
please
this be business
i need to know
how close be reed
to finding to a cure

he be working round the clock
but the
data need to be tested analyzed
before

same old reed
all analysis no
action
be not that the problem with
you two

if these molecule be not stable they
could make we badly maybe even kill
we

then why be reed drag he foot
maybe he like have he prize
specimen under glass
it be ironic be not it
you be finally
the perfect woman for he
because
you be he science project

please do not make this personal

oh i think you already have

victor we can not do anything until the
research be ready

we huh

do not forget who you work for susan
so get to work
and do you job

i wish i wife would disappear



and now lady and gentleman we have
a special guest for you

i bad
sorry about that
thanks for the lesson bro

that be new

have you read these
from all
over
people want we to fight crime
save they kid
solve they problem
when we can not even solve we
own

reed
how close be we to a cure

no way to know
without more
test experiment

we be not specimen we be patient
this be not just another science
project to you be it








what
what be going on

so what can you tell we about the
outfit

not too much but i will say that it be

it up

okay
i be going to go kill he now

ben
slow down a second and

be it true what they say
that he can

actually between we i think he be get
some problem staying rigid

wait for i

which may explain why this woman
not smile

i be driving

dude
that be i sister

hello

von doom
give i a little shock
no
hard feeling right
nothing
personal

you know you could always move back
to Latvura start fresh

maybe that be where you belong back in
the old country


it be pronounced Latveria
this meet over ned

the fantastic four put on quite a
show last night
they landed in every
major headline in the northern
hemisphere
in relate news

report have surface that von doom
industry may be filing for
bankruptcy
you may remember that it
be victor von doom who

sir be everything okay
what
happen to you

reed
he get what he wanted
everything he wanted
he take from i

now i be going to take it back
piece
by bloody piece

victor be you
be you okay

do not worry about i
worry about
yourself

what be you do here

what i should have do a long time
ago
application and patent reed
this all belong to i

but i be not do with the machine

which be precisely the point
analysis be over
it be time for
action
i man could have mass
produced this by now

Massproduced
this be not a
toaster
you have no idea how it
works

recreate the storm invert the
polarity here reverse the mutation
there
do not talk to i like i be some
schoolboy
i have get the same phd you
do

the storm need to be handle exactly
right or it could make we mutation
badly much bad maybe even kill
we

victor please
we need time to
verify the data
we can not afford any
mistake there be only enough ion
for two or three attempt

reed
i be not asking permission
we will build it while you check the
spec

can i talk to you

do not let victor push you into making
a mistake

he be going to take away all i data
equipment

well than you life
victor not
the one who have to get into that
thing
we be

which be why i be working twenty hour
a day checking every variable

every variable but yourself
you
do not eat sleep
you can not live in
you head like

i be not the only one in there
i get
you vic ben johnny all rattling
around in there

so clear it out
get out of you
head
get out of here

mister mister
please help i
i
kitty be stick in a tree

please save miss lucy

eyebrow be a little big



i figure the only way to get you here
be to stick that in the window

how do you know it be i

i be blind not deaf
want to come in

i be not really dressed for a party

relax it be casual

i be a little
dusty

those yours too

i stepdads
i be strictly into

walk by

you know you could run an ad in the
personals

sensual blind chick seek threeton
rockhard heman for deep spiritual
relationship


this be not permanent
i friend
reed working on a cure
i think

bennie
you feel pretty good as be

you do not know what it be like out
there
walk around like some kind
of circus freak
people stare
whispering

i would not know anything about that

i mean

tell i
when you grow up in
brooklyn how many astronaut do you
know
you go you own way then
you
do not listen to people
so why start
now

need a ride johnny

few fan
hope you do not mind

get to take care of the fan right

look i build i business knowing what
people want
and right now the
people want you

and we do not want to let the people
down now do we

no we do not
which be why we need
to strike while the irones hot
i be talking action figure
videogames sponsor

Videogames
you serious

you talk to reed and sue about this

johnny
let we be honest here
ben
reed sue
good people all
but
star
i do not want to break up the band but
you be the one they want
do not you
think it be time to go solo

take the car for a spin
think about
it
be this the life you want
or
would you rather live in reed
lab

i could get ben to tap into the
baxters main power to generate enough
voltage

reed
shh
just be quiet
and look
up

remember we first date here
god
i be so nervous

you be

of course i be
i would read all you
paper on bioethic
some of they two
time just so i would have something to
say to you

you know i bribe the projectionist
ten buck to keep it open late

i give he twenty

i do not want that night to end

sue you be right
it be not
complicate
i just be not ready to
be
to become
you can be a little intimidate

you always talk about how you liked
the kind of man who could approach
you
speak he mind
one who be not
afraid to tell you what he wanted

i do
i do reed
but i wanted
you to be that man

when i walk out i wait ten
minute outside you door
ten
wait for you to come find i

why do not you say something

that would have kinda defeated the
purpose
and reed
i be saying it now

come find i



that be i nose genius
these be i
lip

look around
i will get we drink
they always let blind girl cut the
line

i do not know about this one
it lack
a certain
realism

she be always have a thing for runaway
and stray but this be ridiculous

i know
do she really think these
sculpture would sell

like anybody would want this thing in
they house
that girl a onewoman
charity



this seat taken

what be you do here

i be worry about you

about i
how sweet

come on
let i buy you something to
eat
look like you could use the
company

scuse i

i know it can not be easy
life have not
changed that much for reed sue and
johnny
at least they can go out in
public
but for you
people stare
whisper behind you back

if you be trying to cheer i up you be
do a helluva job

i be just saying i know what it be like
to lose something you love
to see it
slip away and know it be never coming
back

reed going to fix i up

for you sake i hope you be right
i be sorry if that sound a little
skeptical

skeptical

look he be a brilliant man we should
trust he be work as hard as he can
you be he good friend
so what
possible reason could he have for
taking he time
i mean other than get close to
sue

yeah i have that effect on people

ben

oh you remember i name do you
you
happen to remember what you swear to
do with every breath in you body

we be working as hard as we can

yeah
i can tell
victor be right

come on this be nothing

glad nothing could take you away
from you work

ben i do not know if this thing
change we back or make we bad
i need you to be patient for a little
while longe

look at i reed
look at i

i be looking
that be why i can not make
a mistake
i have get to get it right
and it be not right yet
we need to
test this

i spent i whole life protecting you
from the schoolyard to the star
for
what
so you could play twister with
you girlfriend while i be the freak of
the week

ben
stop it
or i will stop it

i be
just go go after he
stop
he

christmas come early
check it out

it be

hey
that be a prototype

go back to the draw board

johnny
do you see ben

yeah for the last time i hope
i be
do with this freak show
i be moving
back to the real world

be that what you call it
real

at least it beat living in a lab like
somebody science project

johnny slow down
think
you know
mom do not raise we to

look around sis
she be not here
so
you can stop talking to i like i be
you little boy

as soon as you stop acting like one
come on you be smart than this
you think those people out there care
about you
you be just a fad to they

let we try something new
you live
you life
and i will live mine
and just for the record
they
i

oh god reed

what do you do reed
what do you
do

i can
make it work

reed stop you need to rest you

the power
i need
more power
to
control
the storm

you need a doctor

more power

leonard
bring i we lab rat

ben
they need you back at the baxter
build
it be
reed

what do you say we get out of here

this you boyfriend

be that all you do
bar trick and
stealing chick

what be you do
you could have
burned somebody

you know if i have you power i would be
do something with it not wasting
i time do cheap bar trick
hitting on some other guy girl

ben come in

what be this
where be reed

where do you think
with sue

i will take it from here leonard

yes sir

what do you want vic

to help you
i have run every test
known to man
and they all yield the
same result
the machine be ready

reed said it would be week till

he also said we would avoid that storm in
space
and we know how that turned
out

he could not generate enough power for
the machine to reach critical mass
yet another mistake for mr
fantastic


and you can
power it up

yes
i have find a new energy source

tell i
do you want to be ben grimm
again

let we do it

oh i god
