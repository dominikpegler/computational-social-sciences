we see spiros solitary van park up in ghostly industrial
estate
the van eventually start and pull away





and a scandinavian banker be
sitting round the boardroom table

with the help of lars and the norske
Velconan bank we aim to buy pap and
son back from the receiver

also i have to say harry that i
believe there be an intuitive bond
between the greek and the nordic
people yah
and so maybe the very
first viking be descend from
ancient greek somewhere in the deep
mist of time
and so it be so
so
wagnerian yah




we should point out the new approach

to buy papadopoulos son but divest
the food manufacture side of the
business

divest the food manufacture
what
else be there

sell off the food but keep the
property

papadopoulos plaza
it be going to be
worth a fortune

that be not what i have in mind

it be an asset breakup

tusk
tusk yah
make we sound like
barbarian

with the new loan you would buy back you
old asset and then sell off the
brand in the pap son stable

yah
and you know how to squeeze the
value harry

that be a break up

please
i know what it be

the pitta bread the cake get sell to
a bakery

the halloumi and feta to a dairy
company

i love you halloumi
grilled
it be




the sell off value of these brand
will exceed the new loan

so i bank will get it money back
fast than you can say knife

and what do you get

lars want of the plaza
development
which be what will remain
after the debt have be settled

so you get of the development for
free

sure yeah
but you get of the
same development yah also for
free

what do you want harry

i want i food business back

reality check
harry
it be not going to happen

the
best you can hope for be to work with
lars here and save something

okay
so
yah
i need to take this to
the board
take two three month
but
pish yah

it seem criminal to buy the business
back only to break it up
as an aside to

can i just point out that you be
skating
figuratively speaking
on
thin fuck ice

i will do whatever the bank want




okay
harry we be going to take this
to the hoop yah
three point
yah
three point





and be walking towards the lift

take out a loan to pay off a loan
so you can remortgage a property
it be
get nothing to do with business
it be
get nothing to do with making stuff

i get i life back

i child get they live back

i be sorry
this be not very
professional

and be strolling along londons south bank




so it be on material
the fish
the potato the package etc
would
you include energy
light heat

yeah
but not rent because we already
own the build

okay
and on labour

yeah

so it be
classic restaurant
model

that be right

what be you weakness

the price of fish can vary
dramatically

can you vary the menu

you do not want to complicate it

it do not have to be complicate
harry
what be you fear

i fear
oh
just that it just will not
work out
that fish and chip have
maybe have it day

no
hang on a second

fish and chip be a british
classic
it be much more than just a
quick meaningless experience
it be
something to be savour
just
think of the soft white cod
flake gently falling away as you
fork pierce the hard crunchy
she will of the golden batter
the
rich smell of a fryer delight
the tangy smack of salt and vinegar
on you lip
hell yeah
i would pay
for that




and exchange glance
they hold a look we should talk
about
we should talk about
account package
