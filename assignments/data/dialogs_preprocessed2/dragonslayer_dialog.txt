these be the arm by which satan
may be put down

you be talking about superstition
friend
none of that have anything to
do with what i galen have already
achieve

but it do not matter

people of Urland
send a messenger
to the king
Vermithrax be dead
crush by the power of the moon and
the star
laid low by ancient wisdom
drop into the abyss by mystical
practice

spoken like a pagan
every word as
reprobate as it be false
solum in hoc signo vinces

Nihil plus mysterium


praise god
blessed be he that be
humble before the lord

the danger be over

i know
what be i going to say to i
friend who still mourn for they
lose girl

you will say you do what you have to
this be a time for celebration
and forgiveness

look like you have be up to a little
sorcery yourself

or be it witchcraft

what be the matter
real woman never
stop talking

i think it be much easier be a
boy

the damnede thing be she be twice
the man of anyone else in the village
now she be twice the woman

would that i have be as clever as
she father

come now Greil
do not begrudge a
life spare

i begrudge nothing
but i wonder at
what we have see and how it be
do

you be there

i see what i see
but this jackanape
be barely ready to carry he master
chamberpot
be not it strange that at
the very moment the beast be put
down we should have a holy man here
in the village

you do not believe that superstitious
christian rot do you

it be say god work he wonder in
mysterious way

celebration
do not stop on i
account
you musician more music

toast
to the deed of the day
you
see good news travel fast
the
king himself have already hear it
and like yourselves tonight he be
overcome with joy

what would you have of we then

not a thing
it be this one
he gesture toward
galen
the king would meet we new benefactor
and offer he gratitude to the man
who succeed where so many have
failed

what sort of gratitude
knife in
the belly
an arrow in the back

i young friend i would as soon dispatch
you as i do the other and for the
same reason
but he majesty would
like a cozy chat and command
otherwise

do not go galen
cast a spell and
turn they into toad
it should be
easy
that be what they be

well well
still plenty of cheek
under those skirt it seem

do not worry
i will be back



one of the good thing about the
water here in Urland be that there be
so much of it look at that

mmm
good
but not cold enough
perhaps i could borrow a scarf from
he majesty

i cover the goblet so
remove
so
and behold
winter in a mug

all right
how many of you have ever
see a table fly

enough
that be fine

wait it will rise now

do not bother
not necessary

tell i
the landslide it be
accomplished this same way

yes

i see
and have render such unique
service to we kingdom what would
you claim as a reward

please no payment
i have always
find magical practice to be it own
reward
i seek only some yet great
challenge

do you ever hear of king Gaiseric
of course not you be not even born
he be i brother a great king and
a valiant manatarms
when he
ascend to the throne the dragon
be unbridled

might strike next
so he bring
forth he broadsword and he spear
assembled a company of he good
fighter and go out to do battle
he be never see again
but he
attack provoke the most terrible
reprisal
whole village incinerate
entire crop burned
death famine
horrible

how do you arrogate to yourself the
role of savior

i be invited

do you ever consider the
consequence of failure

what failure

you people
