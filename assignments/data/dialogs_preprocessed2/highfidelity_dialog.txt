what come first
the music or the
misery
people worry about kid
playing with gun and watch violent
video we be scare that some sort
of culture of violence be taking
they over



but nobody worry about kid
listening to thousands literally
thousands of song about broken
heart and rejection and pain and
misery and loss

do i listen to pop music because i
be miserable or be i miserable
because i listen to pop music

i do not really know what i be do

you do not have to go this second
you can stay until whenever

we have do the hard part now
i
might as well you know

well stay for tonight then

i desertisland alltime top five
most memorable breakup in
chronological order be as follow
alison ashworth penny hardwick
jackie allen charlie nicholson
sarah kendrew

those be the one that really hurt
can you see you name in that list
laura
maybe you would sneak into the
top ten but there be no place for
you in the top five
sorry
those
place be reserved for the kind of
humiliation and heartbreak that
you be just not capable of deliver

that probably sound crueler than
it be mean to but the fact be we be
too old to take each other miserable
unhappiness used to mean something
now it be just a drag like a cold or
have no money

if you really wanted to mess i up
you should have get to i early




which bring we to number one
alison
ashworth



i relationship with alison ashworth
last six hour



the two hour after school and before
the rockford file three day in a
row
on the fourth afternoon



kevin bannister



it would be nice to think that since
i be fourteen time have changed
relationship have become more
sophisticated female less cruel
skin thick but there still seem
to be an element of that afternoon
in everything that have happen to
i since
all i other romantic
story seem to be a scramble version
of that first one

number two
penny hardwick
penny
be greatlooking and she top five

carole king james taylor cat
stevens and elton john

nice manner
nice grade
nice
looking



she be so nice in fact that she
would not let i put i hand
underneath or even on top of she
bra



penny be nice but i be not
interest in nice just breast
and therefore she be no good to i
and so i be finished with she

what be the point

anywhere


she cry and i hated she for it
because she make i feel bad
i
start dating a girl who everybody
said would put out and penny go
with this asshole chris thompson who
told i that he have sex with she
after something like three date
how have penny go from a girl who
would not do anything to a girl who
would do everything

i store right up here
it be called

it be carefully
place to attract the bare minimum
of window shopper

amount of they time looking for

number three in the top five break
up be charlie nicholson sophomore
year of college
some people never
get over nam or the night they
band opened for nirvana
i guess i
never really get over charlie




she look different
dramatic
exotic
she talk a lot about
remarkably interesting thing like
music book film and politics



so we do not have those terrible
strain sentence that seem to
characterize most of i
relationship
and she liked i
she liked i
she liked i



we go out for two year and for
every single minute i feel as though
i be standing on a dangerously narrow
ledge
i could not get comfortable
could not ever stretch out and relax
why would a girl no a woman
like charlie go out with someone who
only a few year ago sew a Foghat
patch on he jacket
i feel like
all those people who suddenly shave
they head and said they would always
be punk
i feel like a fraud
and i be depress by the lack of
flamboyance in i wardrobe



i worried about i ability as a
lover
i be intimidated by the
other man in she design department
and become convince that she be
going to leave i for one of they



she left i for one of they
the
dread marco



and i lost it
i lost it all
dignity faith fifteen pound



any small idea of personal identity
that i have acquired up to that point



i come to three month later and to
i surprise have flunk out of school
and start working in a record store

what i really learned from the charlie
debacle be that you get to punch you
weight
charlie be out of i class
too pretty too smart too witty
too much
what be i
average

middleweight
not the smart guy
in the world but certainly not the
dumb
i have read book like the
unbearable lightness of be
Angelas ash and love in the time
of cholera and understood they i
think they be about girl right

just kidding but i do not like
they very much
i all time top
five favorite book be johnny Cashs
autobiography snow crash by neil
stevenson zen and the art of
motorcycle maintenance the trousers
press guide to rock and i do not
know probably something by kurt
vonnegut
i look through the new
yorker when i neighbor do with
it and i be not averse to going down
to the fine arts to watch subtitle
film although on the whole i prefer
american film
top five being blade
runner cool hand luke the first
two godfather which we will count as
one taxi driver and the shining
i be okay looking average height
not skinny not fat
i genius if
i can call it that be to combine a
whole load of averageness into one
compact frame
you might say there
be millions like i but there
be not really
alot of guy have
impeccable music taste but do not
read alot of guy read but be really
fat alot of guy be sympathetic to
woman but have stupid beard alot
of guy have a woody allen sense of
humor but look like woody allen
some drink too much some drive like
asshole some get into fight or
show off money or do drug
i do not
do any of these thing really
if
i do okay with woman it be not because
of the virtue i have but because
of the ugly flaw i do not have
so
charlie and i do not match
after she i be determined to never
get out of i league again

hello you two
laura it be you
mother
you father angina be a
little rough today and i think
he would like to talk to you
no big
deal
i love you two
bye

rob it be liz
just calling to see
well if you be okay
give i a
ring
i be not taking side
yet
lots of love
bye



charlie and i do not match
marco
and charlie match
i and sarah
number four on the all time break
up list matched
she wear more or
less the same clothes as mine have
an acceptable work knowledge of
music and she have be dump by
some asshole named michael
he be
she moment charlie be mine
sarah
have sworn off man
i have sworn off
woman
it make sense to pool we
loathing of the opposite sex swear
they off together and get to share
a bed with someone at the same time



we be frighten of be left
alone for the rest of we live
only people of a certain disposition
be frighten of be alone for
the rest of they live at twenty
six
we be of that disposition
everything seem much later than it
be



when she told i that she meet someone
else it make no sense
she meet
someone else be contrary to the
whole spirit of we arrangement
all we really have in common be that
we be dump by people and that
we be against dump
we be
violently antidump
so how come i
get dump

you run the risk of losing anyone
who be worth spending time with
but i do not know that at the time
all i see be that i would moved down a
division and that it still have not
worked out and this seem because
for a great deal of misery and self
pity
and that be when laura come
along

i be reorganize i record tonight
it be something i do in time of
emotional distress
when laura be
here i have they in alphabetical order
before that chronologically
tonight though i be trying to put
they in the order in which i buy
they
that way i can write i own
autobiography without picking up a
pen
pull they all off the shelf
look for revolver and go from there
i will be able to see how i get from
deep purple to the soft boy in twenty
five move
what i really like about
i new system be that it make i
more complicate than i be
to find
anything you have to be i or at
the very least a doctor in Robology
if you want to find landslide by
fleetwood mac you have to know that
i buy it for someone in the fall
of and then do not give it to
they for personal reason
but you
do not know any of that do you
you
would have to ask i to

yeah

sense at twelve to realize be so
saccharine and stupid as to be
inarticulatable until michael bolton
that be

sentimental music make you nostalgic
and hopeful at the same time
maries
the hopeful part
Lauras the
nostalgia part
these thing happen
they happen to man at any rate
this be why i should not be listening
to pop music



i always hated this song

she should not do it on the number

no no no you said the number
four with a smile and there be no
the at the front of the title of

and send he a check for whatever i
go minus a ten percent commission
which remind i
can you make sure

as he be ever come to an achievement

look
can i pay you properly
you
do not have to tell he what you get
send he fortyfive buck and blow
the rest

looking back at the
record
look
i
i be sorry
i do not
want to be any part of this

suit yourself
there be plenty of
other who will

that be why i be trying to compromise
what about fifteenhundred

worth five time that

sixty

thirteen hundred

Seventyfive

Elevenhundred
that be i low
offer

and i will not take a penny over ninety

with eleven hundred he could come

i be
not selling they to you one by one


how come i end up siding with the
bad guy the man who run off to
jamaica with some nymphette
i just
get left for someone else so why
can not i bring myself to feel whatever
it be he wife be feeling
all i
can see be that guy face when he
get that pathetic check in the mail
for those record and i can not help
but feel desperately painfully sorry
for he

to laura rob
i talk to she and
she give i a little background
and you be a fuck

to think i sympathize with you for
two second
poor rob

he out of nowhere for the schmuck
upstairs
you let i believe that

it be true

rob
two year ago you get laura
pregnant
you then proceed to cheat
on she
you borrowed money from she
and never paid a dime back
and
then just a few week ago you told
she you be unhappy with she and
be kind of looking around for
somebody else


well she

she be right of course
i be a
fuck asshole
i do and said
those thing
but before you judge
although you have probably already
do so go off for a minute and
write down the top five bad thing
that you have do to you partner
even if especially if you
partner do not know about they
do not dress thing up or try to
explain they
just write they down
in the plain language possible

pencil down
okay so who be the
asshole now


it be almost impossible to find
especially on
yet another cruel
trick on all of the dumbasses who
get rid of they turntable
but

whatever and the israeli and

and who say i like marvin gaye
anyway

hey
marvin gaye

up
that be we song
marvin gaye
be responsible for we entire
relationship

be that right
i would like a word with
he

but do not you remember

i remember the song
i just could not
remember who sing it

i can see why you prefer gaye to
garfunkel
i get it really
but
there be so many other thing to
worry about
they be only record
and if one be good than the other
well who care besides you and
barry and dick
i mean really who
give a fly fuck

you used to care more about thing
like marvin gaye than you do now
when i first meet you and i make you
that tape you loved it
you said
and i quote it be so good it
make you ashamed of you record
collection


well i liked you
you be a deejay
and i think you be hot and i
do not have a boyfriend and i wanted
one

so you be not interest in music
at all

yeah sure
more so then than i be
now
that be life though be not it

but laura
that be i
that be all
there be to i
there be not anything
else
if you have lost interest in
that you have lost interest in
everything

you really believe that

yes
look at i
look at we
the apartment
what else do i have
other than record and cd

and do you like it that way

not really

let we go in

okay number two
the stuff i told
she about be unhappy in the
relationship about half looking
around for someone else
she trick
i into saying it
we be have
this state of the union type
conversation and she said quite
matteroffactly that we be pretty
unhappy at the moment and do i
agree and i said yes and she ask
whether i ever think about meet
someone else
so i ask she if she
ever think about it and she said
of course so i admit that i
daydream about it from time to time
now i see that what we be really
talking about be she and ian and
she sucker i into absolve she
it be a sneaky lawyer trick and
i fell for it because she be much
smart than i

you can take it with you if you want

have you tackle the great
reorganization yet

do not you think there be more
important thing to talk about than
i record collection

you bet
i have be saying that for
year

so
where have you be staying for
the last week

i think you know that

have to work it out for myself though
do not i

i be sorry
i have not be very fair
to you
that be why i come here to
the store this evening
i feel
terrible rob
this be really hard
you know

good
so
be it i job

what
give i a fuck break
be
that what you think
that you not
big enough a deal for i
jesus
give i a little credit rob

i do not know
it be one of the thing
i think of

what be the other

just the obvious stuff

what be the obvious stuff

i do not know

i guess it be not that obvious then

no

and number three
the pregnancy
i
do not know she be pregnant
of
course i do not
she have not tell i
because i have tell she i be
sort
of
seeing somebody else
we
think we be be very grownup
but we be be preposterously
naive childish even to think that
one of we could fuck around and then
own up to it while we be living
together
so i do not find out
about it til way later
we be
going through a good period and i
make a crack about have kid and
she burst into tear
i make she
tell i what it be all about and
she do
i feel guilty and so i get
angry
she told i that at the time
i do not look like a very good long
term bet
that it be a hard decision
and she do not see any point in
consulting i about it
when the
whole sorry tale come out in a great
big



what

what what

do you say something

no
so
be it working out with
ian

rob
do not be childish

why be that childish
you live
with the guy
i be just asking how
it be going

i be not living with he
i have just
be staying with he for a few day
until i work out what i be do
look this have nothing to do with
anyone else
you know that do not
you
i left because we be not
exactly get along and we be not
talking about it
and i suddenly
realized that i like i job and i
like what i life be could be turning
into and that i be get to a point
where i want to get i shit together
and i can not really see that ever
happening with you and yeah yeah
i sort of get interest in someone
else and that go far than it
should have so it seem like a
good time to go
but i have no idea
what will happen with ian in the
long run
probably nothing

well then why do not you quit it while
you seem to not be ahead

when the whole sorry tale come
out in a great big lump like that
even the most shortsighted jerk
even the most selfdeluding and self
pity of jilted wound lover
can see that there be some because and
effect going on here that abortion
and ian and money and affair all
belong to all deserve each other

look
maybe you will grow up and we will
get it together you and i
maybe
i will never see either of you again
i do not know
all i know be that
it be not a good time to be live
here

so what you have not definitely
decide to dump i
there be still a
chance we will get back together

i do not know

well if you do not know there be a
chance right
it be like if someone
be in the hospital and he be
seriously i will and the doctor said i
do not know if he be get a chance of
survival or not then that do not
mean the patient definitely going
to die now do it
it mean he
might live
even if it be only a
remote possibility

i suppose so

so we have a chance of get back
together again

oh rob shut up

hey i just want to know where i
stand
what chance

i do not fucking know what chance
you fucking have

well if you could tell i roughly it
would help

okay okay we have a nine percent
chance of get back together
do that clarify the situation

yeah
great

i be too tire for this now
i know
i be asking a lot but will you take
off for a while so i can get i stuff
packed up
i need to be able to
think while i do it and i can not think
while you be here

no problem
if i can ask one
question

control due to loss of control

if i could only control the when and
how of be dump by somebody then
it would not seem as bad
but then
of course

it would not be rejection would
it
it would be mutual consent

would be musical difference

would be pursue a solo career

she do not
i be fine now

and suddenly i be fine
for the
moment there be not one extra pound
on i chest
this be fate
alison
married kevin
you get it
that be
fate
that be get nothing to do with
i that be beyond i control beyond
i fault


i want to see the other on the big
top five
penny who would not let
i touch she and then go and have
sex with that bastard chris thompson
sarah i partner in rejection who
rejected i and charlie who i have
to thank for everything
i great
job i sexual selfconfidence the
works
there be this springsteen
song bobby jeans off born in the

about a girl who be leave town
year before and he be pissed off
because he do not know about it and
he wanted to say goodbye tell she
that he missed she and wish she
good luck
well i would like i life
to be like a springsteen song
just
once
i know i be not born to run
and it be clear that Halsted street
be nothing like thunder road but
feeling can not be that different
can they
i would like to call up all
those people and ask they how they
be and whether they have forgive i
and tell they that i have forgive
they
and say good luck goodbye
no hard feeling
and then they would
feel good and i would feel good
we would
all feel good
i would feel clean and
calm and ready to start again
that would be good
great even

penny hardwick
this be rob gordon
from high school
yeah



penny be as beautiful as she be in
high school when i broke it off with
she because she would not sleep with
i
in fact she be even more
beautiful and really grow into
herself



she tell i about she life and i
get it
and i tell about mine and
she be interest



and then with no real explanation
i just launch into it
i tell she
about laura and ian and charlie and
marco and about alison ashworth and
kevin bannister

and you wanted to sleep with chris
thompson instead of i and
and i
think you could help i understand
why it keep happening why i be doomed
to be left doomed to be rejected
and

rob
i be crazy about you
i wanted
to sleep with you one day but not
when i be sixteen
when you broke
up with i when you broke up with
i because i be to use you
charming expression tight i cry
and cry and i hated you
and then
that little shitbag ask i out
and i be too tire to fight he
off and it be not rape because i
said okay but it be not far off
and i do not have sex with anyone
else until after college because i
hated it so much
and now you want
to have a chat about rejection
well fuck you rob

so that be another one i do not have
to worry about
i should have do
this year ago

check

sarahs easy to find
she still
send i christmas card with she
address and phone number on they
they never say anything else except
for merry christmas love sarah
i
send she equally blank one back

i can not believe i left you for he
crazy

well
probably seem like a good
idea at the time

probably
i can not remember why
though



i have not get the heart for the
rejection conversation
there be
no hard feeling here and i be glad
that she ditch i and not the
other way around

i could have end up have sex back
there
and what good way to
exorcize rejection demon than to
screw the person who rejected you
right
but you would not be sleep
with a person
you would be sleep
with a whole sad singleperson
culture
it would be like sleeping with
talia shire in rocky if you be not
rocky


charlies in the fuck phone book
she have come to assume such an
importance i feel she should be
living on mars
she be an
extraterrestrial a ghost a myth
not a person with an answering
machine in the phone book
i call
and hang up on she voice mail a couple
of time then i leave i name and
number and throw in a long timeno
see
i do not hear anything back
from she for a few day
now that be
more like it if you be talking about
rejection
someone who will not even
return you phone message a decade
after she rejected you

can i help you

that if she decided she do not want
to see i anymore i would respect that
decision

friend over and i need a spare man
be you a spare man

uh
yes at the moment

great

hey charlie

hey rob

why do you break up with i for
marco

fuck
i know it
you be going
through one of those whatdoesit
allmean thing

huh

there be be a rash of they recently
i find it a little unnerving
in
fact marco called a few month back
and he wanted to see i and rehash
the past as they say and i be not
really up for it
do all man go
through this

mon just answer the question
you can say what you like
what the
hell

it be all kind of lost in the
in
the dense mist of time now
it
be not that i really liked marco
more
in fact i think you be
more shall we say attractive than
he
it be just that he know he
be goodlooking and you do not and
that make a difference somehow
you
used to act as if i be weird for
wanting to spend time with you and
that get kind of beat if you know
what i mean
you selfimage start
to rub off on i and i end up
think that i be strange
and i
know that you be kind and
thoughtful
you make i laugh and
i dig the way you get consume by
thing you loved
and marco seem
a bit more i do not know glamorous
more sure of himself
less hard work because i feel like
i be drag you around sort of
little sunny
sparky
i do not know
you know what people
be like at that age
they make
very superficial judgement
do you
think that be superficial
he be a
clown if it be any consolation

do you tell that to marco when he
do he whatdoesitallmean thing
with you

oh god no
i do not want to hurt
he feeling


i wanted the works and i get it
none of alison Ashworths fate none
of sarahs rewrit of history and
no reminder that i would get all the
rejection stuff a little backward
like i do about penny
just a
perfectly clear explanation of why
some people have it and some do not
all i have learned from charlie be
that maybe i one talent i genius
for be normal be a little
overrated


hey

what the fuck be that

you name

but do not know about that be
what new boyfriend be for
and
hopefully i will not borrow money from
she or have an affair and she will not
need to have an abortion or run away
with the neighborhood and then there
will not be anything to think about
laura do not run off with ian because
i buy she cd she be not that
keen on and to pretend otherwise be
just
just
psychowank
if she
think that then she be missing the
brazilian rainforest for the twig
if i can not buy the plastic people of
the universe first album for new

later

it be not
be you still
on the pill

i do not mean that
i mean
be
that all you used

look we can do other thing

i live with you
you be i partner
just a few week ago and now you be
worry i might kill you and you be
entitle to worry
be not that a
terrible thing
be not that sad


later i wonder if i be really
worry about where ian have be
i
have no idea where he be be and
that give i every right to insist
on protection
but in truth it be
the power that interested i more
than the fear
i wanted to hurt
she on this day of all day just
because it be the first time since
she be leave that i have be able to

laura

i be too tire not to go out with
you

so if you have a bit more energy we would
stay split
but thing being how
they be what with you wipe out
you would like we to get back together

Everythings too hard
maybe another
time i would have the guts to be on
i own but not now i do not

what about ian

ray a disaster
i do not know what
that be all about except that
sometimes you need someone to lob
into the middle of a bad relationship
like a hand grenade i guess and
blow it all apart

mission accomplished

i know it be not very romantic but
there will be romance again at some
stage i be sure
i just
i need
you rob
that be it
and we know
each other and we care for each other
and you have make it clear that you
want i back so

let we go home
okay

okay


but would not you know it
suddenly
i feel panicky and sick and i want
to run around and sleep with female
recording artist


mon
i want to know

want to know what exactly

what it be like

it be like sex
what else could it
be like

be it like good sex or be it like
bad sex

what be the difference

you know the difference

look we be okay now
we just have a
nice time
let we leave it at that

okay that be cool okay
but the
nice time we just have
be it nice
as nice or less nice than the nice
time you be have a couple of
week ago

oh mon laura
just say something
lie if you want
it would stop i asking
you question and it would make i feel
well

well i be going to lie and now i can not
because you would know i be lying

well why the fuck would you want to
lie anyway

to make you feel good

oh great

look rob
if great sex be as
important as you think it be and if
i be have great sex with he
then we would not be lying here now
and that be i last word on the
subject okay

okay

i wish you penis be as big as his
though

like mexico
or jamaica
or
new york even

hey great idea
what i will do be
tomorrow i will get a hold of a box
full of mint elvis presley s on
the sub label and i will pay for it
that way

i will pay for you
even though you
owe i money
we have to do something
with the money i earn
i need to
i deserve it
you can just think of
it as winning the lottery

fantastic
the girlfriend lottery

money do not matter
i do not
care how much you earn
i would just
like you to be a little happy in
you work but beyond that you can
do what you like

but it be not suppose to be like
this
when i meet you we be the
same people and now we be not and

how
how be we the same people

well you be the kind of person
who come to the artful dodger and i
be the kind of person who deejayed
at the artful dodger
you wear jeans
and Tshirts and so do i
and i
still do and you do not

because i be not allow to
i still
do after work
so what
should
we just break up
be that what you be
saying
because if you be i be
going to run out of patience

no but

but what

but why do not it matter that we be
not the same people we used to be

you have not changed so much as a
pair of sock in the year i have known
you
if we have grow apart then i be
the one who be do the grow and
all i have do be change job

and hairstyle and clothes and
attitude and friend and

i can not go to work with i hair dyed
pink
and i can afford to go shop
more now and i have meet a couple people
i like over the last year or so

you be tough

more confident maybe

harder

less neurotic
be you intend to
stay the same for the rest of you
life

i be alright

yeah you be alright
but you be
certainly not happy
so what happen
if you get happy
and yes i know
that be the title of an elvis costello
album i use the reference
deliberately to catch you attention
should we split up because i be used
to you be miserable
what happen
if you i do not know start you be
own record label and it be a success
time for a new girlfriend

you be be stupid

how
what would be the difference
between you have a record label
and i going from legal aid to private
practice

all i be saying be you have to allow
for thing to happen to people most
of all to yourself
otherwise what be
the use

no use

what be this

it be vince and justin

who be that

the little skatefuckers

no way

yes way
it be really

it be really fucking good

you tape
it be good

it be rough
but it show promise
we record a couple of song right
in a studio
i will take care of the
rest
i will put out you record
any profit after recoup expense
get split down the middle between
we and you guy

wait a minute

overhead for one plane ride

visionary

throw down and so i go
and would not
you know it i sort of fall in love
with paul and miranda with what
they have and the way they treat
each other and the way they make i

you know
all along i would like they
it be a
trick

i trick you into meeting some people
you would think be great
i think
it would be fun to introduce you to
someone with a tina turner album and
then see whether you still feel the
same way

i called dan Koretzky because he

have drag city record i know i
know
you told dan Koretzky about
this

yeah and he said it be a good way to
break out a record
especially for
what he said and i quote would be
a highly anticipate event locally

he helped i put out a press release



just local of course

and the triumphant return of rob
gordon
triumphant
return


i have that idea when i be living
with ian and it be such a good idea
that i be annoy we be not together
anymore
it might even be why i
come back

you have no right
supposing i be
do something that could not be
cancel

what do you ever do that can not be
cancel

that be not the point
i mean what
if the single be not do in time

barry said it do

barry
barry know about this

yeah
he band be playing a set

like fuck you be

i will give you of the door if you
do not play

we be get that anyway

what be she do

i be
not kidding
that be how much it

we be not as bad as you think rob

you could not be
look barry
there be going to be people from
Lauras work there people who own
dog and baby and tina turner
album
how be you going to cope
with they

we be not called Barrytown anymore
by the by
they get sick of the
BarryBarrytown thing
we be called

sonic death monkey

sonic death monkey

what do you think
dick like it

barry you be over thirty year old
you owe it to yourself and you
friend and to you parent not to
sing in a group called sonic death
monkey

i owe it to myself to go right to
the edge rob and this group do
exactly that
over the edge in
fact

you will be going over the fuck
edge if you come anywhere near i
next friday night

that be what we want
reaction
and
if Lauras bourgeois lawyer friend
can not take it then fuck they
let
they riot we can handle it
we will
be ready


they will go on early
nobody will
even be there yet and i told they
they can not play for more than a half
hour

it be no joke
i be responsible for
what happen you know
embarrassment
aside there be a lot of money and
effort in this at least by i
standard
i have to put down a
deposit for the room
i have to pay
the press plant for the record
sleeve they sticker they

we take care of that

barry and dick and i
look in the
bedroom


i suddenly feel choke up
it be not
the money it be the way she be think
of everything
one morning i wake up
to find she going through i record
pulling out thing that she remembered
i playing when i deejayed and putting
they into the little carry case
that i used to use and put away in a
closet somewhere year ago
she
know i needed a kick in the ass
she also know how happy i be when i
used to deejay
from which every
angle i examine it it still look
as though she be do all of this
because she love i

i be sorry i have be acting like a
jerk
i do appreciate what you have
do for i and i know you have do
it for the good possible reason
and i do love you even though i act
like i do not

that be okay
you seem pissed off
all the time though

i know
i do not get it


but if i have to take a wild guess
i would say that i be pissed because i
know i be stick with laura bound to
she and i do not like it
that dreamy
anticipation you have when you be
fifteen or twenty or thirty even
that the most perfect person in the
world might walk into you store or
office or friend party at any
moment
that be all go i think
and that be enough to piss anybody
off
laura be who i be now and
it be no good pretending otherwise


excuse i

may i help you

i be looking for deejay rob gordon

uh

old as you be
bit young maybe
but not a lot
not much

so
be now a good time

right
so
you must have an enormous
record collection

want to come over and see it

yeah well

what be
you be alltime top five record

would not play it at the club
it be
a countryrock ballad
Everybodyd

shipbuilding elvis costello
japanese import no horn or
different horn anyway
um
mystery train by elvis presley
and
spaced cowboy by sly and
the family stone
bit
controversial i know but

that be great

be that it

well i would not mind a quick chat
if you get the time

sure but be that it for the list

that be five
so
why do you decide
to deejay again

well it be a friend idea really
and the record release party seem
like a good place to do it
so
looking over she pad
at the list
i should really put a james brown in
there

nice friend

yeah

who
oh
i friend
i friend be
laura

friend who be a
girl

like the Upsetter by lee scratch
perry in there
instead of sin
city


okay
dance music for old people


oh you know
a lot of people be not
too old for club but they be too
old for acid jazz and garage and
ambient and all that
they want to
hear old funk and stax and new wave
and old school hip hop and some new
stuff all together and there be nowhere
for they

and the new label
and the kinky
wizard

oh well the kinky wizard be
you know what
why do not i just
make you a tape

would you
really
wow
i could
have deejay rob gordon play in i
own home

haha
right
it be no problem
i
love making tape


good compilation tape like breaking
up be hard to do and take age
longer than it might seem
you get to
kick off with a killer to hold the
attention
then you have to take it
up a notch but not blow you wad
so maybe cool it off a notch and
you can not put the same artist twice
on the tape except if some subtle
point or lesson or theme involved
and even then not the two of they in
a row and you can not woo somebody
with joni mitchells big yellow
taxi and then bash they head off
with something like GBHs city baby
attack by rat and
oh there
be a lot of rule
anyway i worked
hard at this one

who be that for

this
oh just that woman who
interview i for the reader
carol
caroline
something like that

hi caroline
oh it be rob
yeah

detail the entire story of we future
relationship until suddenly i realize
that there be nothing left to actually
like happen
i have do it all
live through it all in i head
i
know the whole plot the end and
the good part
now i would have to
watch it all over again in real time
and where be the fun in that
and
fuckingwhen be it all going to

second or third time
