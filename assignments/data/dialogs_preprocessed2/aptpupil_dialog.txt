money
if i do i might even give you some
just to be do with this nonsense

i do not need money

probably have to spend it all to sneak in the
country
good american passport be
expensive on the black market that i know

do you
good for you

yes i do
i know it all Dussander
you be
i one great interest

you what

i one great interest
well not you
personally but
well it be something i
learned back in eighth grade
we teacher
miss harmon she said we would have to find we
one great interest in life
you know the
thing that would really grab we
once we do
that everything would fall into place
like
hers she said be not teaching but
collecting nineteenthcentury postcard
i
guess there be no money in that so she have to
be a teacher
anyway she told we to start
think about it
so i do but nothing
happen
until the follow summer in
ronny Peglers garage
that be where i find
it

one of these have three girl do it
at the
same time

i get it
check this out

todd look

hang on a sec

it be all there
picture of stuff i would
never see stuff they
never
put in the book
anymore especially the one they give we to
read
and here be
stack
of they

it
grab
i
it be just like miss
harmon said
i could not believe it
but
there it be the camp the uniform the
the way they saluted each other
but what

anyway i paper really floored
i history teacher
i guess because i get
through all those book without throwing up
but i learned something
i learned that when
you talk about the camp now you have to
remember to sound really disgust
i mean
you can not just say what happen like the
magazine do and leave it at that
if i
tried that the teacher would have freak and
called i parent in

todd you momes on the phone

that be
what i dad say

you climb on the bus and start this slow
walk down the aisle

examining a new batch of inmate

think anybody give you a second glance but
i but somehow
people seem to move out
of you way
and under you arm you carry
a rolled up umbrella
but what really do

there be nothing
wrong with wanting to help people but you

just checking
all right
we will give you way a shot
if
you think you can do it if you really do
and you serious then
okay
you really like the old guy do not you

i be making a difference in somebody life
it be that simple

okay okay
do not ever force it
watch



do not get too drink
we still have a little
while

you do not have to do that you know

screw you
i be do this for i
this
place be freeze

yes it must be fifty degree outside
i be
sure to you it seem positively
frigid

why do not you pay you gas bill

it slipped i mind
i will attend to it
tomorrow

slip you mind
i notice it do not slip
you mind to stock up on a new case of
bourbon

leave i alone

all right so finish you story because i be
still not clear
you cook up this stew and
you bring the prisoner in and you let they
smell it and suddenly they tell you
everything

oh do not misunderstand i
certainly with a
pistol press to they head a prisoner
would tell we everything we wanted to know
sometimes more
but mine be a much more
elegant method
remember it have be month
since they have smell real potato
simmer over an open flame and boy when
that delicious odor hit they nose they
mouth would drop and out would pour an
account of every minor infraction they
friend have committed i mean it be
magnificent

and you let they eat the soup

oh we never promised they the soup in
exchange for information
we never mention
it at all

wow that be really good Dussander
i mean
that be
that be
think

but as the war pressed on the time for
such civilized measure become a luxury
i
remember by april of we have barely
enough food to feed ourselves
the sound of
the russian mortar grow loud everyday but
still the train car from france and poland
keep coming
this be a time of desperation
the oven burned day and night and
still
i
know we would not beat the arrival of the
russian force
many of i man the cowardly
one deserted during the night
but the man
that remain the same one i have called
upon so many time
continued the work
at first we think a massive fire in the
main build would serve we purpose
we
could just crowd they in and pull a gas torch
up to each of the window
but with so many
of they we could not be sure the body would
burn properly
we needed something
certain
then a young bright soldier i
shall never forget he enthusiastic smile
pointed to a pair of bulldozer near the
western gate which have be used during
construction
how perfectly simple it be
the bulldozer carve a narrow trench four
meter deep down the center of the camp
for two hour they dig until i realized we
may not have enough gas to finish the job
so the inmate be given shovel and told
they be building a shelter from the
incoming artillery
when they be do i
immediately called for a practice drill and
three thousand naked body begin to march
into the trench
it take less than twenty
minute to get they in place
quickly the
bulldozer moved down the side of the pit
sending the pile of earth into the massive
grave
those who tried to free themselves
be shot of course but very few cartridge
be wasted that day
the machine be too
fast
back and forth they go
pack
the dirt
one by one the tractor run out of
gas and i man have to scurry along with
shovel
but by sunset
it be do
i
give the order to evacuate
in the distance
the plume of russian mortar fire rose like
an approaching thundercloud
but i know that
no matter what happen
no one would ever
forget what we do here

hello
pause
then with apprehension
yes

no no trouble at all

yes
yes he be here

i see

dear mr
and mrs
bowden this note be to
suggest that we have a group conference
concerning todds first semester grade
in
light of he previous good work in this
school the sudden deterioration in his
grade suggest a specific problem which
should be addressed before he academic
advancement be jeopardize permanently
such
a problem can often be solve by a frank and
open discussion
i be ready to work out a
time for we to meet
in a case such as this
early be usually good
sincerely yours
edward french
who be this edward french
the headmaster

french
fuck no
he be a stupid guidance
counselor

guidance counselor
what be that

he guide and he counsel
you read the
fuck note
do you realize i could have to
go to summer school
i in there with all
those fuckups
i do not want to go to
summer school

or to the reformatory

what do you say

boy
you have a far great problem than
you
school grade
before you speak to i
about what they will get out of you
remember the fact

seventy thousand
people die at patin
have you forgotten
that
to the world at large i be the most
despicable of criminal a monster
do you
think i would stand aside and let you turn i
in so easily
without a fight
be you
american selfconfidence
so bloated
that you
have never once realized you be an accessory
to i crime
you have criminal knowledge of
an illegal alien and have not report it
do not you see that
and if i be catch i
will tell the world all about you
when the
reporter put they microphone in i face it
will be you name i will repeat over and over
again
todd bowden yes that be he name
how long
oh for month almost a year
he wanted to know everything
that be how
he put it yes
everything

they would never believe you

perhaps perhaps not
it be a gamble
how
would you explain all those book you be
reading to i
i eye be not what they
be but i can still read fine print
i can
prove it

so what
i would say you trick i

why would i do that

for friendship because you be lonely and have
no one in you life
no jury would take you
word over mine
nazi
forget it
just
get it out of you head
you can not threaten
i and you can not scare i
what you can do
be find i a pencil

pencil what for

that will take care of the report card i
think
about that fuck letter i do not
know

fuck
come on a pencil
sharp one
with an eraser

will this do

tell i do this french know you parent
in a social way

he
fuck no
they would not mix with a
geek like he

how about professionally
have he ever called
they before

no
i have never needed it
why

i have an idea
it will require you to make
one phone call

mr
bowden

mr
french a pleasure

i those be some
colorful shoe

to you sir i be sure they seem quite out of
the ordinary
but when it be you job to get
confuse sixteen yearolds to open up to you
you take whatever step you need
please
have a seat

and the shoe work

they seem to help believe it or not
well
i thank you for coming down mr
bowden but
i will be frank with you

yes please do

the fact that you be here and not todds
parent tell i a great deal

i be sure
i son and he wife ask i to
come in and discuss this sorry business with
you mr
french
todd be a good boy believe
i
this trouble with he grade be only
temporary

it be all right
pull an ashtray from desk
drawer
there be no smoke on school ground but if
it will make you more comfortable i will never
tell

terrible habit but thank you
i suppose i should begin by informing you
that i son and i daughterinlaw be have
trouble at home
rather bad trouble i
should think

i appreciate you candor

the mother drink

oh

yes
the boy have tell i that he have come
home on two occasion and have find she
sprawl out on the kitchen table
he know
how i son feel about she drink and so on
these occasion he have put dinner in the oven
himself and forced enough black coffee down
he mother throat so that she will at least
be awake when richard get home

that be bad
have mrs
bowden think about
get professional help for she problem

the boy have tried to persuade she but she be
far too ashamed i think
if she be given a
little time
you understand

of course
you son
todds father

he be not without blame believe i
the
hour he work
the meal he have missed
they take a toll on a family
i be raised
to believe that a mane family come before
he work or anything else
i tried to teach
i son that
but

there be only so much we can teach we kid
mr
bowden

what about Monicas mother or
father
could not they talk to she

she mother sabrina life in a nurse home
in florida
i be afraid after she husband
die she lost she will to live

probably not the good person for monica to
speak to

indeed

mr
bowden i do not have to remind you i be
sure of todds stellar academic record
national merit scholar finalist academic
AllStars

yes
i keep he certificate on the wall of
i store
i run a small bookstore in san
remo

yes i see that
anyway todd be and i hate
to phrase it this way but he be one of the
one worth fighting for
he be a special kid
we both know that
but if todds grade
do not improve drastically and quickly
he will be opening a real nasty can of worm
summer school would just be the begin
he whole college acceptance schedule would
be throw way off course
the good school
will not know what to make of he
i be sure
he would hate that and so would you

of course

so let we get to the bottom line shall we
what i be propose be some family counsel
at the counselling center downtown
everything be in confidence of course

man in charge down there harry Shumacher be
a good friend of mine
i think todd and he
parent should go see he together
it might
be difficult for todd to go to he parent
with this
i think you should do it
maybe
we can get everybody on track by the end of
the next quarter
it will be tough but not
impossible

i be not sure that would be the good thing for
the boy
the parent might resent he if i
take they that proposal right now
thing
be very delicate
to swing the scale too
far in the wrong direction might because more
harm than good
the boy have promise to work
harder in he study
he be most concern
by the drop in he grade more alarm than
you might expect
he have he mind set on
attending stanford or berkeley next fall and
do not wish to see he plan altered

yes well

also the parent would resent i
monica
already think i meddle too much in she
affair

i have a great deal of experience in these
matter mr
bowden
and please understand
that i interest in you sones marital
problem begin and end with the effect they
be have on todd
and right now i think
they be have quite an effect
i really
think counsel be in order here

allow i to make a counter proposal
you
have i believe a system for warn parent
of poor grade

yes interpretation of progress card

card
the kid call they flunk card
they
only get they when they grade in a class
fall below the seventy percent
that mean a
or an
why

and they be send out when

Midquarter
that be about three week into
the new mark period

allow for christmas break the next time
they be send out will be in late january
correct

yes that be right

good
then what i suggest be this

you what

i told he you be get back on track by
you own accord
i give he i word
if you
get even one flunk card

be you out of you fuck mind
i be going
to get three or four flunk card
i failed
an economics test today so there be another
one

boy it be the good i could do without
arousing suspicion

i could have do well myself

well you do not do you
this be the way it
be and now you be upset because the only way
you can make thing right be to work

you be insane
i be upset because it can not be do

it can
and it will
you will work

i do not take order from you
maybe you have
forgotten

listen boy
before today it be possible
just barely possible that you could have
denounce i and come out clean yourself
the way you nerve have be lately i do not
think so but never mind that
it be at
least technically possible
but now thing
have changed
today i impersonate you
grandfather one victor bowden
and it be
you who arranged the meet
what would
people make of that
if thing come out
now
perhaps you be right you age and a
good attorney might keep you out of jail but
you would be humiliated boy publicly
you
would be infamous
you parent too
do you
know what such a scandal would do to they
to you
think about that

you fucker

it be a do deal boy
if you do not like it
you can discuss it at family counsel

in hell that i can pull myself out of a half
year slide in a couple of week

one saved up

story of how i escaped from berlin after i
be foolish enough to go back
that be a
close one i promise you

anything really

no none of these i think
you do not seem to
be in the mood

i think today i will tell you the story of an
old man who be afraid
he be afraid of a
certain young boy who be in a queer way
he friend
the boy prove to be a very good
student but perhaps not in the way he
mother or he teacher have envision
at
first the old man disliked the boy intensely
but then he grow to
to enjoy the boyo
company
of course there be still a great
deal of distrust between they

each know something that other wanted to keep
secret
but over time the old man begin to
feel that thing be changing
he feel his
hold on the boy slipping away from he

so
one sleepless night the old man get out
of bed and write down the story of he
involvement with the boy
everything he
could remember from the first day forward

when he finished he hand be stinging from
arthritis but he feel good for the first time
in week
he feel safe

he climb back into bed and sleep until it
be time for general hospital

on the follow day the old man put on his
good suit and go down to one of the local
bank and rent a safety deposit box
the
bank officer explain to the old man that he
would have a key and the bank would have a
key
to open the box both key would be
needed
no one but the old man could use the
old mane key without a sign notarized
letter of permission from the old man
himself
with one exception

that exception be make in the event of the
boxholders death

then what

then the box be open in the presence of a
bank official and a representative of the
internal revenue service
the content of
the box be inventory
in this case they
will find only a twelvepage document
Non
taxable
but highly interesting

you can not

i boy it be already do

but
christ
look at you
you could go at
any time

then there be nothing for i

but there be
as the year go by as i get
closer to the grave you hold on i will
become worth less and less
man five ten
year old than i worry more about his
ailing heart than be extradit to israel
and there will come a day if i live long
enough when i decide what you know no

month ago so by god he buckled down hit
the book and pulled himself through it

lady and gentleman student and faculty
here to deliver the student remembrance for
the class of this year valedictorian
todd bowden

we all have dream that we carry with we
perhaps it be a dream of prosperity or
happiness
but now so early in we live
it seem that all we should ask for be to be
at peace with the world because only then
can we be at peace with ourselves



we learn from we education that we be the
master of we own destiny
we learn what
it be that separate we from the other why
we be special

what about this

yes
all photograph

you boy well come down to the cellar
you be not going to believe this



each of we have unique talent and interest
unlike those of anyone else
the challenge
now as we stand at the doorway to adulthood
be to channel we ability into we goal



we forge we own path
we education be but
a step stone to the world

we
we true destiny await we
there we
become the

there we become the man and woman that will
make a difference
but we must take away
from this place a sense of purpose for
ourselves
we now begin to see the road
ahead
it be a road from which we cannot
veer

do not you want to see you buddy

i want to go dad
right now

todd i name be dan Richler
i be a special
agent with the
this be i associate dr
weiskopf

hello

what kind of doctor be you

i be a school teacher

dr
weiskopf be a professor at the judaic
institute in munich
he be assisting the
israeli government in certain matter
he be
here today only as an observer

thanks for calling we up mr
bowden
you
saved we the trouble of tracking through the
record

actually it be todds idea to call
he
thought
we think there might be some way
we could help you investigation

todd if you would not mind i would like to hear
about you involvement with Dussander
but
you know he as arthur Denker right

yeah
i never know of that other name till i
see it in the paper

how do you know he

i meet he at the movie
last summer

he
ask i where to pick up the number seven
bus
he said he eye be not too good
will you excuse i for a minute

you okay honey

i just get to use the bathroom
i will be right
back

he be not feeling well

can i get you some coffee

todd let i tell you what we be really
interest in here
you told the admitting
nurse that Denker have a heart attack while
you be reading he a letter

that be right
i be
that be what i be
do there
it be in german but he
insist i try to read it anyway
once or
twice he get pissy about the pronunciation
but i ask he what do he want from i
i
do not speak german
mr
Denker
Dussander
get really excite at one point
he yell out yes that be what you would do
all right
but i do not know what he be
talking about
then he grab he chest

and that be when you called the ambulance
right

that be right

well this be the part we can not figure out
the letter itself todd
do you remember
what happen to it

i guess it be still on the table
i
could not swear to it but

wait i see a letter
it be in german
i
do not think anything of it at the time
but yeah it be on airmail stationery

then it should still be there
this be we
problem

it be not

no

maybe somebody broke in

why would somebody break into he house
simply to steal a letter

unless
there
be someone
someone right here in santo
donato who would want to protect he for some
reason
maybe a close friend or even
another fugitive
i know it sound like a
bunch of robert ludlum stuff but when
Dussander be taken to the hospital we think
we mr
scoot over to the house and
swipe the letter

that do not make sense

why not todd

well if Denk
if he have an old nazi buddy
in town why do not he come over himself and
read the letter to he
if you could have
hear the way he correct i at every word

good point
except maybe this other fellow
be in a wheelchair or blind

guy that be blind do not normally go
scoot out to steal letter

true
do Dussander have any friend that
you know of

no not really

how about phone call

no i hear he phone ring maybe five or six
time in all the time i know he
it be
never anything out of the ordinary
salesman
wrong number

do you ever hear he speak german on those
occasion

no
he hardly ever speak german
he always
said he would teach i someday but he never
get around to it

do he ever talk about he past

not really
little bit i guess

well do not you remember what he told we at
thanksgiving

he said he be in college

monica
they do not care what we know they
care what todd know

look i be sure this whole thing have come as a
terrible shock
i think we have do enough
for the day

thank you todd
mr
and mrs
bowden

wait a minute
agent Richler before you
go todds not a suspect in this be he
