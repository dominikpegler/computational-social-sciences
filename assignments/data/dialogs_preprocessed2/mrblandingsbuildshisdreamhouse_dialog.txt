Stellwagons socalled progressive
project

use salt and hand
it to jim
now dear there just be not any point
in sending you child to an
expensive school if you be going to
undermine the teacher authority in
you own dine room

i be not undermine anything
i happen
to be in the advertise business
and keeping abreast of the time be
important to i

and so be you child education

that be not the point

it certainly be

it certainly be not

without looking up
from she magazine
bicker bicker bicker

you eat you cornflake

joan every time you father and i
have a lively discussion we be not
necessarily bicker
to betsy
solicitously
what be it dear another english
composition

taking toast from
joan
miss Stellwagon have assign each of
we to take a want ad and write a
human interest theme about it
to jim
pass toast
to he
i find one typical of the
disintegration of we present society

taking toast not
looking up from his
paper
i be not aware of the fact that we
society be disintegrating

i do not expect you to be father
miss Stellwagon say that middle
class people like we be all too
prone to overlook the pressure and
tension which befall the less
fortunate member of we community

muriel i know it be asking a lot
but just one morning i would like to
sit down and have breakfast without
social significance

jim you really might take a little
more interest in you child
education

you can not squeeze blood from a turnip

all right
all right
i will listen

picking up she
scrapbook
it be just twentyfour word
but in
simple eloquence it mirror a minor
tragedy of we time

well

forced to sell
farm dwell oak
grove apple orchard trout stream
hay field four barn seclusion
superb view original beam pave
highway acreage
will sacrifice


go on

that be all

that be all

you do not see it do you father

no
fellow want to sell a house so
he put an ad in the paper
what do
you expect he to do take it to the
unite nation

there must be more to it than that
be not there dear

certainly mother
what some people
do not see be the whole sordid picture
poor honest farmer push to the
wall by hardship soil erosion
mortgage everybody gobble
gobble gobble until finally
in desperation he be forced to
sell and stoop to the crass
commercialism of newspaper
advertise

oh indeed
crass commercialism
advertise

miss Stellwagon say advertise be
a basically parasitic profession

oh she do

miss Stellwagon say that advertise
make people who can not afford it buy
thing they do not want with money
they have not get

perhaps you miss Stellwagon be right
perhaps i ought to get out of this
basically parasitic profession
which at the moment be paying for
she very fancy tuition those extra
french lesson she progressive summer
camp and for that matter the very
brace on you tooth

i wish you would not discuss money in
front of the child

to conceal
a feel of guilt
darling you know how long we have
said we have get to do something about
this apartment and well he called
last week and i have he come over
and he be get some simply wonderful
idea

there could not be two bunny
Funkhausers could there

man who be responsible for that zebra
stripe monstrosity in the collins
live room

phil collins told i what he paid
for all that function
if you think i be going to

darling please
child you will be late to school
run along and

miss Stellwagon say that
functionalism in modern furniture

never mind dear

good morning

with a sharp
appraising look
hi

good morning mr
Funkhauser
you
remember mr
blandings

but of course

you will have to pardon i bursting in
at this dreary hour
put a sketch on a
chair
practically the middle of the
night
put wallpaper against
mantel
but i do so want to catch you
in
i have be at it hammer and tong
all week and i be just a mess
drape bolt of chintz
over highbacked
chair
but then muriel and i think we
ought to talk it over with you before
we take the plunge

smooth out fold
on the chintz
after all it be you home too and
it should reflect you
you know
mans castle all that sort of thing

muriel

jim just wait till you hear
he be
get some wonderful idea for the
foyer

oh that be out
all out
change the
whole thing
i just could not live
with it
i said to myself bunny
what be the blandings
how shall we
do they
and the answer be perfectly
obvious
very american very grass
root very blueberry pie that
sort of thing

mm

now first let we dig into this live
room of yours it be really a dreary

quickly
to jim
we want this room to be very gay
dear
something in bright red
yellow and green

red yellow and green

oh come mr
blandings let we not
run away from color

not running away
just backing off a little

uh yes
now as i see we room it be definitely
colonial
you know cobbler bench
breakfront pie cooler student lamp
hook rug
but everything in good
taste
it must not jump out at you
and scream
look see how antique
i be


heaven forbid

of course these thing take
imagination
you have simply get to be
able to visualize

politely remove
chintz
if you will forgive i mr
Funkhauser
what i would like to visualize at
this dreary hour be how much be
this all going to cost

well really i hesitate to say
after all
by the time this wall be out we
may find

this wall be what

out
source of light be from the
east
obviously if we room be to
have any function at all

you be going to tear out the wall

dear it be a wonderful notion

visualize three foot of leaded pane
the rest

can you give i a figure

well
cost be not what they used to
be you know and

just a figure

material be impossible labor have
just run wild

just an overall figure

well
i should not like to be tied
down
but i suppose if you must have
a figure i would say mm
somewhere in the neighborhood of
seven

mm
seven

mm

that would be seven
thousand

mm

well
that seem fair
after all we be not running away
from color
and we be tearing out wall
mr
Funkhauser do you have a card

jim we have not even discuss the
rest of the house

we will dear
lead the whole batch
on Funkhauser

well really i

deftly steering he
toward the door
we will talk it all out and then we will
get in touch with bunny

well really i mean i be under
the impression we would come to some
decision today

i be sure we will

well

so nice of you to come
put Funkhausers
hat on he head
good day

now darling you you just do not
go to a man like Funkhauser and ask
how much it be going to cost before
you even know what he be going to do

no that would be too logical
seven
thousand dollar
blueberry pie
i
would not put seventyfive cent into
this brokendown rat trap

it be we home jim
betsy be
practically born in this apartment

that do not make it a national
shrine
seven thousand dollar and not one
word about closet

closet
you would not even let he
get to the bathroom

i have not get that kind of money

the way you talk jim blandings
you would think i be some kind of
congenital idiot

sometimes i be beginning to wonder

you can just get out of here

that be not a bad idea






sorry

good morning mr
blandings

morning

you wanted to see the color copy
from this month house and stream

will that be all

looking up
blankly
hm

will that be all

forced to sell
farm dwell oak
grove apple orchard trout stream
hay field four barn original
beam


well that be the way it all start
the ad be enough to convince jim


but muriel be a little tough
i guess the corsage do it


there they be two little fish from
new york out in the deep deep
water of connecticut real estate
that be smith the real estate
salesman
mighty shrewd cookie in a
quiet sort of way
never think
he would get a bite this quick

more line

well folk there she be the old
hackett place

it be simply charming

that be for an old house

of course you understand mr

speak
nothing really definite in
mind

perfectly all right

study house
with
assume indifference
mm
not a badlooking place but
it be certainly a lot old than
anything we have in mind

she be no spring chicken
but that be just what make she
such a buy

this be not just old timber or a
virgin stand oak grove other side of
the trout stream or a couple of
fruit orchard

piece of american history

interest in spite
of himself

blandings i know you can look
at that house and just about picture
what a couple of coat of paint and
a little pointing up here and there
can do to it

look

singing gaily to

home home in connecticut with a
closet to hang up you petticut


jim

going on as he place
he napkin in his
lap
no hustle or fuss no fifth avenue
bus

uh jim

hm

i be just wonder dear
ten
thousand dollar be such an awful
lot to offer

that be for two people who do not
know anything at all about real
estate or anything
i mean do not you think perhaps we
should have ask someone
professional advice

like
say
a lawyer

well bill know about these thing
and

muriel for once in i life i be going
to make one small decision on i
own without the legalistic
machination of mr
bill cole

it seem very peculiar that when
you very good friend happen to be
one of the very clever young
lawyer in new york city

muriel i do not want to hear another
word about bill cole
well do you mother tell you about
the house

yes

well

miss Stellwagon say the current
craze for modernize old farmhouse
be a form of totem worship

do it ever occur to you two that
there may be some remote intangible
subject upon which you miss irma
Stellwagon be not the final authority

why do not we buy a Solaxion house

you know it be just barely
conceivable what kind of a house

Solaxion
it be build on a mast like
a tent and it revolve with the sun

oh it
revolve
with the sun

that be right

who life next door buck rogers

it be the only practical way to live
when a new model come out you trade
the old one in like a use car

muriel

child you have not even see this
house yet

personally i would like a crane mobile
home
it come all folded up and all
you do be plug it in for electricity
and water and

now just a minute
what kind of child be these
do you want to spend the rest of
you live in chromium tent and
portable merrygorounds
this house
be build before we country become
a nation
it have dignity
it be
it be

special delivery mr
blandings

with suppress
excitement
from smith

mm

well

i have convey you offer of ten
thousand dollar to mr
hackett and
be sorry to say he be not interest
however i feel


oh dear
maybe we should have go
a few dollar high

he be bluffing
simple as that

for ten thousand dollar we could
get a rockford trailer and a Zamboni
power unit
it be kitchen bathroom
and air conditioning all rolled up
into

muriel i will let he push i to ten
thousand two hundred but not a
penny more


dear mr
blandings
while you offer
of ten thousand two hundred be still
not acceptable to Ephemus hackett


dear mr
smith
you may inform mr
hackett that the very high i could
possibly go

dear friend blandings

i dear friend smith

dear blandings


dear smith







what do you think bill
steal huh

it certainly be

perhaps steal be an understatement
swindle might be a little more
appropriate

well it be not much bill
i just
see a good thing and i
what do you mean

every time you get a little tight
you weep on i shoulder about the
advertise business and how it force
a sensitive soul like yourself to
make a live by bamboozle the
american public
pick up smiths
correspondence
i would say that a small part of
this victimized group have now
redress the balance

what be you talking about

you
you have be taken to the cleaner
and you do not even know you pants
be off

dear i told you
i said we should
call bill

never mind muriel
to bill
challengingly
all right just what be wrong with
this deal

first time around you offered ten
thousand dollar for fifty acre
right

what of it

that be two hundred dollar an acre
i know that part of connecticut and
one hundred dollar an acre be
standard topgouge price to city
slicker
when the native sell to
each other it be around forty or less

forty dollar an acre

the mane entitle to a fair profit

not two hundred and eightyfour
percent
and besides you be not get fifty
acre you be only get thirty
five more or less

where do it say that

i refer to a rather obscure post
script on the back of the second
letter from friend smith

incidentally mr
hackett have be
a little overoptimistic about the
acreage
it will probably survey
somewhere in the neighborhood of
thirtyfive acre more or less but
i feel sure


all right so it be thirtyfive
what be
the difference
do you know how many
tennis court you can get on thirty
five acre

you be not spending eleven thousand
five hundred dollar for tennis
court

that be not the point

that be precisely the point
we be
going to write this hackett a strong
letter and tell he he can either
kick in with those fifteen acre
reduce the price or find another
sucker

we will do no such thing
i be not going
to queer this deal over fifteen break
down acre

we be just going window shop
and so far it be cost we eleven
thousand five hundred dollar and
they even make we pay the commission

you do not understand business

you mean extortion

i wonder if we could get another two
year lease on the apartment

now wait a minute
you can not measure
everything on a slide rule
this
house have certain intangible

like what for instance

like antique value for instance
it
just so happen that general gate
stopped right there at that very
house to water he horse

i do not care if general grant drop
in for a scotch and soda you be
still get rock

that be a different war

i think bill absolutely right

struggling to contain
himself
quietly
let i explain something
to both of
you
for fifteen year i have be
coop up in a four room cracker
box
just get shave in the
morning entitle a man to the
congressional medal for bravery

that do not make this a good buy

bill muriel and i have find what
i be not ashamed to call we dream
house
it be like a fine paint
you buy it with you heart not you
head
you do not ask how much be
the canvas how much be the paint
you look at it and you say it be
beautiful
i want it and if it
cost a few penny more you pay it
and gladly because you love it
and you can not measure the thing you
love in dollar and cent

well that be how i feel about this
place
and when i sign those paper
saturday i can look the world in
the face and say it be mine
i
house
i home
i thirtyfive acre


coming over
moved
touched
we house
we home
we thirtyfive
acre

more or less




thence along said stonewall fence
form the east boundary of said
Lansdale road

foot to the end of said stonewall
fence thence along a wire fence

foot to a dead twenty
inch chestnut tree thence westward
to said stonewall fence to a total
of thirtyone and a half acre

what be that
how many acre

Thirtyone and a half

i be under the impression you
property be thirtyfive acre mr
hackett

it be
more or less

you see mr
blandings when you
signed the purchase agreement it be
subject to trace map attached
survey to an even thirtyone and a
half acre

anything wrong

it be nothing you honor just a few
less tennis court

with ministerial
resonance

to have and to hold to he the
said grantee he heir and assign
to he and they own proper use and
benefit forever


subject to a six thousand dollar
mortgage hold by Ephemus whittaker
hackett


mi


congress ought to pass a law
when a
man buy a house in Lansdale county
there be a prize he get ten percent
off if he can find it



what in the world be shrink mills


they be probably mill that have
shrink

well you certainly be not much of a
help

look you really want to find that
house of yours it be no problem

just pretend you be one of general
gate horse and you be thirsty
now where would you go for a drink
of water


well i must admit it be a very
beautiful thing

the house and the lilac be just the
same age bill
if the lilac can
live and be so old so can the house
it just need someone to love it
that be all

it be a good thing there be two of
you one to love it and one to
hold it up

Whatd you engineer say when he
check over the foundation and that
roof

who need engineer
this be not a
train you know

i just see it move

this house have be standing since
the second year of the continental
congress
you take one look at it
and shingles start to fall off

look let i do you a favor
i have
get a client crackerjack structural
engineer joe Apollonio
he
practically build the george
washington bridge singlehand

thanks a lot but we be not building
a bridge

he be the follow who advised the
government not to raise the normandie
they do not listen to he cost they
five million dollar

you have i word if i be raising
the normandie i would not make a
move without Apollonio
now would you like to come inside
and look around

a skeptical look at
the roof
no thank i will just stay out in the
car and listen to life can be
beautiful


i think you would well contact mr
Apollonio


it have charm have not it mr
Apollonio

Uhhuh

of course any small change would
have to conform with the character
of the countryside

Mmhmm

and yet still be functional

gazing upward
oblivious
Uhhuh

well uh what be you professional
opinion

tear it down

tear it down

if you chimney be shoot and you
sill be okay i would say go ahead
fix she up
if you sill be shoot
and you chimney be okay again i would
say go ahead fix she up
but you
sill be shoot and you chimney be
shot

take a look at the way she sag

so i say do not throw good money after
bad tear it down

thanks a lot

it be okay

bill cole and he expert

darling we will get we own expert


and so they get they own expert
mr
simpson said

tear it down


on the other hand mr
murphy said

i think you would well tear it down


and then just to be a wee bit
different mr
jones said

firmly
deep bass
voice
tear it down





and that be how we friend mr
simms
come into it


of course you could fix up that old
house
you can fix up any structure
that be still standing
the sill and
floor could not be bad i grant
you and i guess you would have to jack
up that west corner at least three
foot to make it level
need new
chimney
new roof
complete new
plumb
too bad you do not buy it ten year
ago
could have fixed it up in jig
time then and it would have make
some sense

nervously nibble
at he nail
Uhhuh
mmhmmm
uhhuh

fact be before you be through it
would be less expensive to tear the
old place down and build a new one
same size

mm
new house
as the notion sink
in become attractive
new house

to simms with
pleasant incredulity
you mean
for the same money
we
could build a brand new house

it certainly would not cost any more

hm
new house

just
what sort of thing do you
have in mind

well i imagine the type of house
you would want would be something in
quiet good taste two story frame
and brick veneer construction
modern but of course fitting in
with the architectural tradition of
the countryside

well i what do you think muriel

i think it sound fine

perhaps you would like to see a basic
floor plan
reach into file
behind he
something like this

first floor
live room study
dine room kitchen service porch
maid room upstairs three family
bedroom with two adjoin bath

it be very nice i be sure but uh
well do not it seem just a little
bit conventional

yes simms if we be going to build
a house we want it well you know
just a little bit different

he be hear all this
before
yes of course

now for instance

here in the study if we could
just push out this wall a little
and put in a builtin bar we could

excuse i dear

these bedroom
they do seem rather
small
and of course we would have to
have a little dressing room and

and closet simms lots of closet
if there be one thing this family
need it be closet

as he hand reach
for the pencil
if i might make a suggestion

and bathroom mr
simms
each bedroom
must have at least one bathroom

but that would be four bathroom
mrs
blandings
he hand reach for
the pencil
i think i would well point out to you

just a minute
do you think
we might manage a little playroom in
the basement nothing tremendous
you know something like this

as he hand reach
for the pencil
cautiously
well it be always possible but at
the moment we fundamental problem

and i have always wanted a little sew
room upstairs
jims and simms
finger drum
impatiently
you know a little utility room where
i can be alone and sew or sulk or
on a rainy afternoon

as he hand take
pencil
pardon i dear
on that playroom
simms not too small
you know plenty
of room for pingpong dart nice
big poker table

as he hand reach
for another pencil
if you do not mind i

and off the kitchen i would like a
little flower sink just to putter
around in

and a terrace off the study with
an owning and little outdoor
fireplace


well
let we just see what we have
here
in the first place

i be afraid you have get the upstairs
about twice as big as the downstairs

it be all those bathroom

it be not it be all those closet

by extend this breakfast room
you have eliminate the possibility of
any stairs going to the second floor

oh you can just shove those stairs
in anywhere

patiently
almost
paternally
and mrs
blandings on that sew
room the way you have it now the
chimney stack would come up right
through the middle of the room
leaving you with something in the
shape of a square doughnut
which of course might be very warm
in winter but otherwise of doubtful
utility

you could always move the chimney
somewhere else could not you

well
rise
resigned to
he fate but tactful
look i think i know just about what
you two have in mind
why do not i go
ahead with some preliminary plan
and

you do that simms but remember
we have get to hold it down to ten
thousand

that i can tell you right now be
impossible
even with a considerable
trim of the thing you have
indicated i do not see how we can
bring it in for less than twelve or
twelvefive

Twelvefive
look at muriel
then
well i guess we be not going to
quibble about a few penny one way
or the other

no you will find mr
blandings never
quibble about penny

and uh have you any notion
about how you would like the old place
taken down

why do not we just blow on it

there be a good local house wrecker
i will have he contact you

fine
you just shoot ahead with those
plan and remember try to keep it
down to ten tenfive

well we will try

there be one good thing about get
that old relic down
those original
beam and everything this time
somebody pay we


they beam be worth money
you payin
he or he payin you

he be payin i

how much

thousand

thousand

he squawk but he paid

hmm
i guess maybe i get a little
something comino too

okay boy let she go

well so far it be cost we thirteen
thousand three hundred and twenty
nine dollar and fortyfive cent

but we have get the nice vacant lot
in the state of connecticut


something will have to give somewhere
that i know

it be impossible
i do not see how we
can cut another inch

honey you hear simms
as the house
stand now it be over fifteen thousand
dollar

well it just do not seem possible
for a house with such small room

mrs
blandings i have already
explain
it be not only the size of
the room so much as it be the number
you see we primary problem be one
of cubage

that be right dear cubage

what be that

oh
just a figure of speech

but what do it mean

Cubage
it be just the number of cubic
foot that
go into a cubic foot
go on simms

now be it absolutely essential for
each of you daughter to have she
own room with two closet and a
separate bath

a look at the girl
clearing he throat
yes
you see er i daughter be
er approaching womanhood and er

brief look at the
girl
i have not realized they be
approaching it quite so fast
perhaps what you need be not so much
a house as a series of little
bungalow

hmmm
what about that silly flower sink
we could eliminate that

i beg you pardon

or that sew room upstairs that be
certainly a waste

if we be going to eliminate anything
we will lose that ridiculous play room
in the basement with that great big
poker table

honey i have get to have some
relaxation

we have get thirtyone and a half acre
go out in the back and do a little
garden

sure and get poison ivy

if i may interrupt i would like to
suggest that none of these be really
major elimination
now if we could
do with one less bathroom on the
second floor

i be sorry
we could not possibly

mrs
blandings a simple bathroom
eight by ten by eight with grade
fixture will cost around thirteen
hundred dollar

i refuse to endanger the health of
i child in a house with less
than four bathroom

for thirteen hundred dollar they
can live in a house with three
bathroom and rough it

look perhaps the most practical
thing would be

oh look we be in the Lansdale paper
historical society blast vandalism


muriel simms explain to you
we have
just get to cut cut
what be that

censure vote pass re destruction
of famed hackett edifice


well be not that just too bad
let
i see that

what be so funny

Prutty
mrs
Bildad Prutty
get a
load of this
the semimonthly meet of the
Lansdale historical society be turn
into an uproar last night when it
president mrs

it new york buyer of the historic
old hackett house

year ago the society start to
raise a fund to purchase and restore
the old house to it original
condition

look up laugh
scornfully

read on father

the project fell through by be
seven hundred dollar short of the
sum of twentysix hundred dollar

jim slow down as
the follow
register

which Ephemus hackett testify
be the low reasonable price he
could accept as

Twentysix hundred dollar

and what do we pay father

Elevenfive with the commission

muriel be not it time for those
child to be in bed

now girl i do not want to tell you
again

excuse i

Twentysix hundred dollar

i would not be too concern about
mrs
Prutty and she committee
after
all it be you property and if you
want to tear it down

why bill

hello muriel
he stride past she
waving a telegram
to jim
well you have do it again
once
just once why do not you come to i
and find out if it be all right if
it be legal before you go barge
off and run yourself smack into
another jam

what be eating you

ignore he
to
simms
and i must say simms i hold you
equally responsible

what
what happen

i be afraid i do not understand

to simms
indicate
jim
do you let this idiot tear down
that house

what if he do
what of it

reconstruction be unsound and totally
impractical

i quite agree
but you be dealing
with a man who do not think before
he act who go off halfcocked

what be it
what do i do

ignore he
to
simms
you be an architect
you must have
be aware of the legality involved

what
what legality

you know there be a mortgage on
that house

i assumed as much

what happen
what be you talking
about

ignore he
to
simms
and you know the requirement in
regard to a mortgage where there be
demolition intended

certainly
but since you be his
lawyer i naturally assumed

with a man like this you can not assume
anything

just one minute
i be entitled to
know what i do
this be america

mane guilty until he be proven
innocent

it be the other way around father

you go to bed

girl

would you mind telling i in clear
concise english just what crime i have
committed and why

in clear concise english you tear
down a house on which another man
hold a mortgage without first get
he written permission

well i i do

and in such case the mortgagee can
demand the full payment of said
mortgage upon demand
and mr
Ephemus hackett so demand
six thousand clam
and he want
they now

now

you have get ten day

for six thousand dollar we could
have have a Solaxion house and a crane
mobile home

muriel

toward the door
girl say you good night and off
to bed without another word

uncle bill

miss Stellwagon say the problem of
the parent should be the problem
of the child

help prepare you for motherhood

perhaps we would well let the plan go
for the time be and

go ahead with you final plan and
let we see some estimate

and we will just forget about that

sudden

friend of fifteen year

every time he
go out of this house he shake i
hand and he kiss you

would you prefer it the other way
around

well i do not like it that be all
why be he always hanging around

this sort of

jumping
mahogany

now obviously these bid be way out
of line that be all except john
retch and son at twentyone thousand

Twentyone thousand

and with some judicious cutting i
think we can pare that down to
eighteen

we have only ask for the bare
necessity

frankly with all the extra you two
have

never mind
hand estimate to
simms
if you will just send we a bill for

soft green
not quite as bluish as a robin
egg but yet not as yellow as daffodil
bud

mm

the good sample i could get be a
little too yellow but do not let
whoever mix it go to the other
extreme and get it too blue
it should
just be sort of a grayish yellow
green

there be no need to be so irritable
just because you have to shave at

well it be something
you be certainly
upset about something
i can always
tell

going back to shaving
with study unconcern
it be just that i do not happen to
approve of falsehood and deception
particularly in i own wife

what be you talking about

distinctly remember you telling i
you give back bill fraternity pin

well do you or do not you

do i or do not i what

give it back to he

to explain how this happen to fall
out of you jewel box

you
you be jealous
you be standing
there with you face full of soap
and you be jealous

day you would bring i out to this thirty
eight thousand dollar icebox with a
driedup trout stream and no window
or maybe i just happen to fall in

still in embrace
looking up
hello simms what bring you out
with the morning dew

just drop by to check the
blueprint
some extra come in from
retch this morning and there a
couple of thing i think we ought
to go over together

arm still around
muriel
unconcerned
really
what be they

well let we see
thumb through
sheet
few little thing here all right i
guess
mortising five butt a
dollar sixtyeight


let we not quibble about that
mane
entitle to mortise a few butt now
and then

extra nail and screw three
dollar eightynine cent

petty larceny but let he get away
with it

now there be one here i frankly do not
understand
ah here we be
change in closet twelve hundred
and fortyseven dollar
do you
authorize that

well we probably told he to
twelve hundred and what

Fortyseven dollar
change in
closet

who do he think we be
look at bill
very
businesslike
what be this notation
refer to detail
sheet number one thirtyfive


far as i remember that would be
something in the back of the house
let we just take a look

ah here we be
it be not a closet
at all
it be off the back pantry
mrs
blandings little flower sink

oh
mrs
blandings little flower
sink

you do not authorize any change
do you

well
they certainly be not
change

what have you do

speaking rapidly a
little confuse
i have not do anything
and what i
do be
just nothing at all

what have you do

well
all i do be one day i see four
piece of flagstone left over from
the porch that be just going to be
throw away because nobody wanted
they and i ask mr
retch if he
would not just put they down on the
floor of the flower sink and poke a
little cement between the crack and
give i a nice stone floor where it
might be wet with flower and thing
that be absolutely all i do

that be all you do

absolutely
just four little piece
of flagstone

to muriel
wearily
do you by any chance authorize a
drain

of course i do not
all i said be i
wanted a nice stone floor and mr
retch be just as nice as could be
and said you be the doctor and
that be all anybody ever said to
anybody about anything

well

sigh
plunge in
all right i think i can tell you
what happen
first the carpenter
have to rip up the floor that be
already laid
those plank run under
the whole width of the pantry so
retch have to knock the bottom out of
the pantry wall to get at they

then he have to chop out the top of
the joist under the flower sink
space to make room for a cradle
i
guess he buy some iron strap and
fasten they to a big pan to give
he something to hold the cement
what with that add load on the
weakened joist i will bet he have to
put a lally column down there for
support too

it be just four little piece of
flagstone and i only

quiet

well the main soil pipe run under
there on wall bracket so retch have
to get he plumb man back to take
out a section so he could get that
cradle set
i guess that mean he
have to change the pitch of the soil
pipe from one end of the house to
the other
morning mr
cole

morning
hello jim

hello bill

the bridge be roped off and bill
have to stay last night

oh

sleep like a rock

i be delight

and then of course there be hot
and cold water pipe hook to the
joist right under that pantry
they
go up to the wing bathroom on the
second floor and i will bet i bottom
dollar he have to relocate they

and i guess the electrician have to
rip out about sixty foot of armored
cable between the main panel and the
junction box by the oil burner
including the two hundred twenty
volt cable that go to the stove

morning everybody
whew
what a
night

Lansdale

the bridge

be not here last night
