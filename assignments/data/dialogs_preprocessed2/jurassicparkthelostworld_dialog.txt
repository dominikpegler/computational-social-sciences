whole world of
intricate interlock behavior
vanished everywhere except for
site
please
let we not do what

thank you john
mr
ludlow

an accent similar to
hammonds
these picture be taken in a
hospital in costa rica fortyeight

on a yacht cruise stumble onto site

the little girl will be fine but
she parent be wealthy angry and
very fond of lawsuit

and twentysix million dollar
the
list go on gentleman research
fund media payoff
silence be
expensive

this corporation have be bleed
from the throat for four year
you
we board of director have set
patiently and listen to ecology
lecture while mr
hammond signed
you check and spent you money
you have watch you stock drop from
seventyeight and a quarter to
nineteen flat with no good and in
sight
and all along we have hold a
significant product asset that we
could have safely harvest and
displayed for profit
enormous
profit

enough money to wipe out four year
of lawsuit and damage control and
unpleasant infighting enough to not
only send we stock back to where it
be but to double it
and the one
thing the only thing stand
between we and this asset be a
bornagain naturalist who happen to
be we own
well i do not work
for mother nature
i work for you

whereas the chief executive
officer have engaged in wasteful and
negligent business practice to
**further/far he own personal
environmental belief
whereas these practice have
affected the financial performance
of the company by incur
significant loss
whereas the shareholder have be
materially harm by these loss
thereby be it resolved that john
parker hammond should be resolved from
the office of chief executive

hand

all those in favor of ingen corporate
resolution please signify you
approval by raising you right hand


yeah


shit

you be he be not you

excuse i

the guy
the scientist
i see you
on
i believe you

Roooooarr

i be misquote
i be merely
speculate on the evolutionary
scenario of a lose world
i never
said i be in any such place

whom shall i tell mr
hammond be
calling

ian malcolm

not an animal lover

not really

ian
do not linger in the doorway
like an ingenue come in come in

it be good to see you
it really be
how be the leg

resentful

when you have a lot of time to think
it be funny who you remember
it be
the people who challenged you
it be
the quality of we opponent that
give we accomplishment meaning
i
never told you how sorry i be about
what happen after we return

i do not know you be not well

it be the lawyer
the lawyer be
finally killing i

they do have motive
why do you
want to see i
you message said it
be urgent

you be right and i be wrong
there
do you ever think you would hear
i say that
spectacularly wrong
instead of observe those animal i
tried to control they
i squander
an opportunity and we still know next
to nothing about they live
not
they live as man would have they
behind electric fence but in the
wild
behavior in they natural
habitat the impossible dream of any
paleontologist
i could have have it
but i let it slip away
thank god for site

what

well
do not it all seem a trifle
compact to you

what be you talking about

the hatchery in particular
you
know i initial yield have to be low
far less than one percent that be a
thousand embryo for every single
live birth
genetic engineering on
that scale imply a giant operation
not the spotless little laboratory i
show you

i do not believe you

isla Nublar be just a showroom ian
something for the tourist site
be the factory floor
we build it
first on isla Sorna eightsome
mile from Nublar

no no no no no no



after the accident at the park a
hurricane wipe out we facility on
site
we have to evacuate and leave
the animal to fend for themselves
and they do
for four year i have
fight to keep they safe from human
meddling now i want you to go there
and document they

be you out of you mind
i still
have nightmare i reputation a
joke i leg be shoot you think i
need more of that

it would be the most extraordinary
live fossil record the world have
ever see

so what

i have be putting this together for
over a year
i have personal suggestion for you
entire team phone number contact
people
they will not believe you about
what they be going to see so do not
bother trying to convince they
just
use i checkbook to get they there
i will fund you expedition through i
personal account as such money and
equipment as you need but only if
you leave immediately
if we
hesitate all will be lost

john



you will need an animal behaviorist
someone with unimpeachable
credentials
i believe you already
know sarah harding
she be get
theory about parent and
nurturing among hunterscavengers i
bet she would be die to prove on a
scale like this
if you convince she
to go it will be a major coup
when
she publish the scientific
community must take it seriously

you documentation you should use
forensic photographic method
Hasselbladt still camera high
definition video
when the trick
photography analyst take you
evidence apart make it impossible
for they to say there be enhancement
or computer graphic imaging
oh
this be very important avoid the
island interior at all cost
stick
to the outer rim
everything you
need to know can be find there
vindication lie on the outer rim

i be not going john

ian you be i last chance to give
something of real value to the world
i can not walk so far and leave no
footprint
die and leave nothing
with i name on it
i will not be
known only for i failure
and you
will not allow yourself to go down in
history as a lunatic
you be too
smart
Youe too proud
dr
malcolm
please
this be a chance
at redemption
for both of we
there be no time to equivocate we
must seize it now before

hello uncle john
dr
malcolm

do i interrupt something

find someone else


so you two be just uh telling
old campfire story be you

do i a favor
do not pretend for a
second that you and i do not know the
truth
you can convince time
magazine and the skeptical inquirer
of whatever you want but i be
there

you signed a nondisclosure agreement
before you go to the island that
expressly forbid you from discuss
anything you see
you violate that
agreement

you cost i i livelihood
that on
which i rely to support i
child

if you university feel you be
cause it embarrassment by selling
wild story to hard copy i hardly
see how i be to

i do not tell anything i told the
truth

you version of it

there be no version of the truth
this be not a corporate maneuver it be
i life

we make a generous compensatory offer
for you injury

it be a payoff and an insult
ingen
never

ingen be i livelihood dr
malcolm and i will jealously defend
it interest
people will know what
i want they to know when i want they
to know it

do not forget that

do you have a satellite phone


ajay

how do you know

that cheap aftershave i send you
every christmas you actually wear
it
i be touched
sit down sit
down what bring you to Mombassa

you
tell i roland when be the
last time you answer you phone

last time i plug it in i suppose
why

i get a call from a gentleman who be
going to costa rica or thereabouts
if he be to be believe it be a most
uh unique expedition
and very
wellfunded

well i be a very wellfunded old son
of a bitch
you go

but alone
we always have great
success together you and i

just a little bit too much i
think

how do you mean

true hunter do not mind if the
animal win
if it escape
but
there be not enough escape from you
and i ajay
i have decided to spend
a bit less time in the company of
death
maybe i just feel too close
to it i

excuse i

you sir be no gentleman

be that suppose to be an insult

i can think of none great

buzz off you silly old bastard

what do i have to do to pick a fight
with you bring you mother into it

be you kidding
i could take you
with one arm tied down

really

i mean i arm

sorry
we be saying

reason other than you boredom
tell
the truth roland
be not you even
interest in knowing this
expedition quarry

ajay
go on up to i ranch take a
look around the trophy room and tell
i what kind of quarry you think
could possibly be of any interest
to i


hyena

come on

closer

sarah

circle north
straight
through disrupt
herd moving
stamp
there be
straight
through
angling through from the
north

ian
this well be important

when


we leave in twentyfour hour

equipment and he will be there to
maintain it
he be designing special
field trailer now top of the line
mobile research unit

no no look at the plan henry
you can not place that strut laterally
it have to be crosswise


sorry eddie
spec say it can not
deform at we have to test
it

any damage

minimal

minimal be too much
it have to be
light it have to be strong

Lindstradt air rifle
fire a
subsonic Fluger impactdelivery dart

i loaded the enhance venom of conus
purpurascens the south sea cone
she will
most powerful neurotoxin in
the world
act within a
twothousandth of a second
fast
than the nerveconduction velocity
the animal down before it feel the
prick of the dart

be there an antidote

like if you shoot yourself in the
foot
would not matter
you would be
dead before you realized you would
accidentally pulled the trigger

oh

i

god

it be beautiful

stegosaurus family Stegosauridae
infraorder Stegosauria suborder
Thyreophora
length adult male
estimate twentyfive to thirty foot

that be a pair bond
family
group even long after that infant
be nestbound

i want to see the nest ground

lone nest not colonial
i do not
see an egg clutch

the empty shell be crushed and
trampled
the young stay in the
birth environment that be conclusive

not without a shot of the nest

she be gutty

she be nut

ian you be not insane
i be so
glad

dr
malcolm the world owe you
an apology


no more smoke
we leave no scent
of any kind
no hair tonic no
cologne seal all we food in plastic
bag
we will observe and document
but we will not interact

that be a scientific impossibility
you know
heisenberg uncertainty
principle
whatever you study you
also change

what should i call this
jurassic
pork


and let we forget about the high hide
we can not do this kind of work up in a
tower we need to be out in the
field as close to the animal as
possible

i be not surprise stegosaur live in
a family group but there be never
be anything in the fossil record to
prove the carnivore do

why would not they
look at hyena
jackal nearly all species of
predator bird

that do not say a thing about Trex
they could have be rogue
robert
burke certainly think they be

we have get to see one to find out
be there any

no way

oh i god

way we could safely

oh no

fire


campfire

no
water mix the smoke billow
use dirt

who the hell start a campfire
o
s

it be just to make lunch

i wanted it ready when you get back

oh
man


you know you be putting yourself in
a potentially dangerous situation
but you do not bother to find out
how dangerous before you leap in
you do not have the faint idea
what be going on on this island

what do you want to do ian lock she
up for curiosity
where do you think
she get it

do you have chromium tape
the
other fog in high

humidity i know
high lead density on the market

we have get a lot of heavy marching
ahead of we
i be not carrying
anybody

i can keep up

you be going home
i be sending a
radio call for the boat
we will all
go down to the lagoon and wait for
they

lighten up ian you sound like a
high school viceprincipal

i be she father

sure now

do you see any family resemblance
here

you can not stay kelly that be it
it be too dangerous

if it be so dangerous why you bring
any of we

you be wrong dad
i do know
what be going on on this island

how could you possibly

because you said so
maybe nobody
else believe you but i always
do

the kid score with cheap sentiment

ian if we recall the boat now we have
make two invasive landing in one
day
Thatll have to go in any paper
i write and it will leave room for
people to say we finding be
contaminate
you know the academic
world as well as i do once they
smell blood in the water you be
dead
we presence have get to be one
hundred percent antiseptic
that
mean if we bend a blade of grass we
bend it right back the way it

you be saying something about
antiseptic


welcome to you dream come true dr
burke

i believe the large herbivore forage
in open plain like bison which
would explain the great variety of
heat dot we be reading in the
flatland around this waterhole
right here

then that be where we be going

Hadrosaurus
Carinthosaurus
Maiasaurus

this be as good a place as any for
base camp
first priority be the
laser barrier i want they all up
and running in thirty minute
half
an hour understand

cancel that dieter

what
why

carnivore hunt near stream bed
do
you want to set up base camp or an
allyoucaneat people bar

you hear he dieter
find a new
spot
and remember we be after
herbivore only no unnecessary
risk

peter if you want i to run you
little camp trip there be two
condition
first i be in
charge and when i be not around
dieter be
you job be to sign the
check tell we we be do a good
job and open you case of scotch
when we have a good day
second
condition i fee
you can keep
it
all i want in exchange for i
service be the right to hunt one of
the tyrannosaurs
male
buck
only
why and how be i business
if you do not like either of those
condition you be on you own
go
ahead and set up you camp right
here or in a swamp or in the middle
of a rex nest for all i care
but
i have be on too many safari with
rich dentist to listen to any more
suicidal idea
okay

what else can he say

okay

good lad


pachycephalosaurus

carnivore

huh
no
no herbivore late
cretaceous
very unusual plant
eater see that distinctive dome
skull
that be nine inch of solid
bone

who care

just get they out of the way dieter



oh for god

dieter
this be a roundup not a
war
use you power of persuasion

come on come on do not have all
day

going on to no one in
particular
see the pachys neck attach at the
bottom of it skull instead of the
back of it head as with reptile

so when it lower it head it neck
line up directly with it
backbone

roland

which be perfect for absorb
impact

it match the picture

it certainly do



do not worry about we
we will catch
up

where do you think you be going

to collect i fee

ajay

i be no tracker but even i can read
this spoor

do you wish to go where the animal
have be or where the animal be


why do not you tell we about these
guy ian

because i do not know
i do not have
the faint idea what they be do
here

ruine everything that be what
they be do
you could choke on
the diesel smoke already

ian nothing we observe will be valid
if we be trail along in the wake
of an army

ingen
what be ingen

where do it say that

on the side of that one truck

ingen be a genetics corporation
be not it

be that who we be really work
for
gene splicers

no
we be an independently fund
expedition

funded by whom

john hammond

but he be the head of ingen

you get to be kidding
you drag i out of greenpeace to
be a corporate stooge
you could not
get anybody else

yeah what have you do dad

we would well keep moving or we will
lose they

what be you do to i john


it be the rex nest

make a blind here
wait for the buck
to return

if the nest be upwind so be we
when he come back he will know we be
here before we have a chance
the
truck

be to get he to come where we
want he




they be they be




alive dieter and uninjured
o
s

those be very expensive animal
can you hear i

turn that off

easy easy not too close
full extension

now

next case


Carinthosaurus compsognathus
triceratop pachycephalosaurus
or small scavenger only

ludlow
that be why hammond be in
such a hurry for i to get here
he
know they be coming

you okay

height i can not help it
put you
arm here will you

what do they want

they want they money back
to
ingen this island be nothing more
than a bed investment

we should get back to base camp
eddy waiting for we

i can not believe peter Ludlows
running all this

he be not
check out the guy walk
past the fire
o
s

i have see he before
in brazil
he
and that guy with he be
spearhunting jaguar
say it be
immoral to go after they any other
way
he be not just a hunter he be a
philosopher
kind of guy who beat
you up with you own argument

he be the one in charge

well if that be true the man in
charge just leave camp

then this be we chance

we chance to do what

i do not know these guy but i know
they
i have see they on japanese
whaler french barge trying to dump
barrel of nuclear waste in the north
atlantic
they be all the same
they spray we with water cannon when
we try to stop they sink we boat
and then call we crazy

nobody have to come with i
i have
do this before

why nick
you be a treehugger

there no reason for name call

dr
Juttson please take kelly back
to camp right away
leave the other
car for we and we will meet you there
in an hour or so

what be you guy going to do

exactly what john hammond wanted we
to do


offering a little incentive

what kind of gun be that

i father
nitro express
make
in
Karimojo bell give it to
he after he take down he last
elephant
foot pound strike
force

how close do you have to be

forty yard
less maybe
i assume
it will take a slug in the brain case
to bring he down

why not just use a scope and a poison
dart and snipe he from a hill

or a laser beam from a satellite

you rally think this draw the
parent

i once see a bull elephant die
charging a jeep
all the jeep have
do be startle the bull calf
i see a lioness carry wound prey
four and a half mile all the way
back to it den just to teach it
cub how to finish off a kill

kill lesson
heartwarming

rex will not be any different
it will
come

you be kidding yourself
an adult
Trex care about one thing
filling it own belly
it act the
way people wish they could that be
why everyone fascinate by it
if
people have the chance to see one
dinosaur and one only ninetynine
percent would

wait
why not
sedative
growth inhibitor

what

i have not planned on bringing
carnivore back because of the
liability risk but i only think of
adult it never occur to i
you be a billion dollar idea i
little f

what the hell you do that for

have to
to keep he still for the
trip

you have broken it leg

we have get to transport it seven
thousand mile
would you prefer it
bit off the leg of a crew member


hang on
we may encounter some
turbulence

if you be really interest in
infant we will have good luck at
the seaside because the sand offer
a cushioning surface where the egg
clutch can can

what in god

last time i leave you in charge

sick bastard

what in christs name be going on

be not it obvious

we be not alone on this island


nick thank god we do not know
if

wait do not

we


ian close the window it be going to
wake every predator in the jungle

there they be

what be that they have with they

this be exceedingly unwise

too late to worry about that
hold
he together nick

just do whatever you have to do and
get it out of here as quickly as
possible

okay there be the metatarsal
tibia fibula there it be
see
it
that be a fracture just above
the epiphysis

that little black line

that little black line mean death
for this infant
the fibula will not
heal straight so the ankle joint
can not pivot when he stand on his
hind foot
the baby will not be able to
run and probably can not even walk
it will be cripple and a predator
will pick it off before it get more
than a few week old

can you set up

it have to be temporary something
that break apart and fall off as
the animal grow

think fast sarah

what be they do
why do not
they hurry

give i the radio

give it more morphine

we will kill it with too much we will
put it into respiratory arrest
i be
almost do
damn it i need
another adhesive something pliable i
can

spit

rule when a news crew be in a war
zone
you stop the van every two
mile and decide whether or not to go
on

and you turn around right there no
question ask nobody embarrass
well

i be satisfy with the
evidence we have right now

do you have enough to publish

they will come after i
but i can
collect some stool sample for
with that nicks tape and the rest
of you to back i up it should stand
when we get back

you know that

do not start a legal argument with i
this island be not you property and
neither be these animal

what be you do here burke
there be no camera what be the
point

dr
Juttson you exist outside the
classroom
i be amaze

be you looking for a problem

everyone keep you voice down

back off dieter

listen to i by moving the baby
rex into we camp we changed the
adult perceive territory

they what

oh god

that be why they persist in
destroy the trailer they now
feel they have to defend this entire
area
we be not safe here

thanks to you people

hey we come here to observe you
come here to stripmine the place
it be a looter mentality all you care
about be what you can take

none of that matter
we
communication equipment be
destroyed
if you radio and
satellite phone be in those
trailer that go off the cliff and
i be guessing by the look on his
face

we be stick here lady and
gentleman
and we be stick together


if we can not stay in the rexes
territory we have to move tonight

move where
we boat not coming
for two day you airlift be waiting
for an order you have no way to
send

there be a communication center here
in the old worker village
hammond
put in some kind of renewable power
source replenish
it may still
work
if we could get there we
could send a radio call for the
airlift

how far be the village

i said if we could get there

well how far be it

day walk maybe more
that be not
the problem

what be

the velociraptors

we infrareds show they nest
site be concentrated in the island
interior
that be why we planned on
keeping to the outer rim

what be velociraptors

carnivore
pack hunter
about six
foot long three or four hundred
pound and very very fast

i think we can handle ourselves
against they

no
i be quite certain you can not

look we have two choice
we can
hike back down to the lagoon where
we can sit for two day in the open
next to a heavily use water source
while we be waiting for you boat to
arrive or we can head for the
village where we might find some
shelter and we can call for help

we would never make it past the raptor
trust i i have some experience in
this matter

that may be
but you be not with
i at the time

load up
let we get this moveable
feast underway


damn it

you all right

wrong question

you ever hear of gambler ruin

what be that

statistical phenomenon
say
everything in the world go in
streak
it be real you see it
everywhere in weather in river
flooding in baseball in blackjack
in stock market
once thing go
bad they tend to stay bad
bad
thing cluster
they go to hell
together

feeling a bit blue be we

just flawed
very deeply flawed

why do you come here

so that other would know about this
place

why should they

because it exist

it will still exit if they go on not
knowing will not it

yes
and people will live in the
absence of truth

so the truth be more important to you
than you life

i do not care about i life
but if
i would ever think for a second that
she would be in danger

she yours
o
s

i be afraid so
i do not know what the
hell i be do with kid
i never
should have have she

why be you here

somewhere on this island there
exit the great predator that
ever live
and the second great
predator must take he down

but why

you remember that guy about twenty
year ago i forget he name but he
climb everest without any oxygen
come down almost dead
and they
ask he why do you go up there
to die
and he said i do not
i
go up there to live


it be called selftesting
but in
you case it sound more like
selfdestruction
uniquely human
characteristic
in fact human
being destroy thing so well that i
sometimes think that be we function
maybe every few son some animal
come along that kill off the rest
of the world clear the deck and
let we evolution proceed to he next
phase
maybe death and destruction
be we job maybe we be suppose
to destroy ourselves and every other
live thing that

tell you what
you can see whatever
you want to to i but you will not
spew any more nihilist rant at
anyone else in the group
i be
fighting panic and you push the
wrong button
understand


i do not think i dad do not
think we be going to make it

you dad be wrong
about a lot more
than he know

i think you should call a break

another half hour

some of they will not make another half
hour
we do not come this far to
start dropping in the middle of the
jungle
if you do not call it i
will



i can not believe you be still angry
about that

you know it be very easy to criticize
the first person who study
something

no it be easy to criticize sloppy
research and hasty conclusion

you know even if we do get those
tape back people be going to say
it be just another hoax
ian
malcolms alien autopsy

maybe
maybe not

ian they will misplace we evidence
shoot hole in we testimony and say
some special effect genius created
the animal
the only way people
will ever believe that dinosaur
exist be if you dump a Trex in the
middle of time square

there be something more important that
you should be think about instead

wait here for i would ya carter

it be not polite to

sneak up on people



i

o
s

carter
i

grandfather would want we to do

why

because it be true

i know lex

only one who ever know it will still
be true
you see i have decided
that if the world find out about
what you grandfather created it
would not be around for very long

but it be real
you can not let
people go on saying it be not

that be the thing about reality

even when people stop believe in
it it do not go away



do you feel the cold wind blowing on
you face
that be real



do you see the four of we standing
here together alive
that be real
