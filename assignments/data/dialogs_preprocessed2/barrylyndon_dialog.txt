wretched and so remain alone all
night in a state of agony
i do
not care for drink or know the
dreadful comfort of it in those

but captain best be already known as
a valiant soldier and be famous as

accepting lodgings in i own house
where captain OReilly will welcome
with delight i gallant young
preserver



perhaps have i be a little old in
the world experience i should
have begin to see that madame
OReilly be not the person of
fashion she pretended to be
but as
it be i take all she story for
truth and when the landlord
bring the bill for dinner paid it
with the air of a lord
indeed she
make no motion to produce the two
piece i have lend she



and so we ride on slowly towards
dublin into which city we make we
entrance at nightfall
the rattle
and splendor of the coach the
flare of the linkboys the number
and magnificence of the house
strike i with the great wonder
though i be careful to disguise
this feel



we stopped at length at a house of
rather mean appearance and be let
into a passage which have a great
smell of supper and punch

mr
OHiggins i cannot say how
grateful i be for you timely
assistance to i wife

i be only sorry that i be unable to
prevent the villain from carrying
off all she ladyship money and
pearl

mr
OHiggins we be in you debt
and rest assure sir you have
friend in this house whenever you
be in dublin
mister OHiggins i wonder if i know
you good father

which OHiggins do you know
for i
have never hear you name mention
in i family

oh i be think of the OHiggins
of Redmondstown
general OHiggins
be a close friend of i wife dear
father colonel granby somerset

ah i see
no i be afraid mine
be the OHiggins of Watertown

i have hear of they

i love i wish i have known of you
coming for bob Moriaty and i just
finished the most delicious venison
pasty which he grace the lord
lieutenant send we with a flash of
sillery from he own cellar
you
know the wine i dear
but as
bygone be bygone and no help for
they what say you to a fine lobster
and a bottle of as good claret as
any in ireland
betty clear these
thing from the table and make the
mistress and we young friend
welcome to we home

i be sorry mr
OHiggins but i
do not seem to have any small change
may i borrow a tenpenny piece to
give to the girl


i have some money i dear
here
betty go to the fishmonger and
bring back we supper and mind you
get the right change



we supper be season if not by
any great elegance at least by a
plentiful store of anecdote
concerning the high personage of
the city with whom accord to
himself the captain live on term
of the utmost intimacy
not to be
behind hand with he i speak of i
own estate and property as if i be
as rich as a duke



have i be an english lad the
appearance of the chamber i occupied
might indeed have aroused
instantly i suspicion and distrust
but we be not particular in ireland
on the score of neatness hence the
disorder of i bedchamber do not
strike i so much



be there a lock to the door or a
hasp to fasten it to



though i counterpane be evidently
a greased brocade dress of mrs
OReilly



and i crack toiletglass not much
big than a halfcrown yet i be
used to these sort of way in irish
house and still think myself to
be in that of a man of fashion



there be no lock to the drawer
which when they do open be full
of i hostess rougepots shoe
stay and rag

i need not ask whether you have a
comfortable bed
young fred
Pimpleton sleep in it for seven
month during which he do i the
honor to stay with i and if he be
satisfy i do not know who else
would not be



after breakfast we drive out to
phoenix park where number of the
young gentry be known to mrs
OReilly to all of whom she
present i in such a complimentary
way that before half an hour i have
get to be considered as a gentleman
of great expectation and large
property



i have little notion then that i have
get amongst a set of impostor
that captain OReilly be only an
adventurer and he lady a person of
no credit
the fact be a young
man could hardly have fallen into
bad hand than those in which i
now find myself



they friend be always welcome on
payment of a certain moderate sum
for they dinner after which you
may be sure that card be not
wanting and that the company who
play do not play for love merely



what could happen to a man but
misfortune from associate with
such company
and in a very very
short time i become they prey

i shall have to write out a note for
the rest of it captain OReilly

master roderick you appear a young
fellow of birth and fortune
let i
whisper in you ear that you have
fallen into very bad hand it be a
regular gang of swindler
and a
gentleman of you rank and quality
should never be see in such
company
the captain have be a
gentleman gentleman and he lady
of no high rank
go home pack
you valise pay the little trifle
you owe i mount you mare and
ride back again to you parent
it be the very good thing you can do



into a pretty nest of villain
indeed be i plunge
when i
return to i bedchamber a few
hour later it seem as if all i
misfortune be to break on i at
once

whom have i be harboring in i
house
who be you sirrah

sirrah
sirrah i be as good a
gentleman as any in ireland

schemer a deceiver

well as you mr
roderick james

gentry of this methropolis
i take
you to i tradesman who give you
credit

hark you mr
OReilly i will tell
you why i be oblige to alter i
name which be james and the good
name in ireland
i changed it sir
because on the day before i come to
dublin i killed a man in deadly
combat an englishman sir and a
captain in he Majestys service
and if you offer to let or hinder i
in the slight way the same arm
which destroyed he be ready to
punish you

childes blood
let he escape in
heaven name let he go

he may go hang for i and he be
well be off quickly for i shall
go to the magistrate if i see he
again



where be now a home for the
descendant of the james
i be
expel from dublin by a
persecution occasion i must
confess by i own imprudence
i
have no time to wait and choose
no
place of refuge to fly to



there be a score of recruit
party in the town beating up for
man to join we gallant army in
america and germany

i will tell you frankly sir
i be
a young gentleman in difficulty
i
have killed an officer in a duel
and i be anxious to get out of the
country



but i need not have troubled myself
with any explanation
king george
be in too much want of man to heed
from whence they come and a
fellow of i inch be always
welcome
indeed i could not have
chosen i time well
transport
be lying at Dunleary waiting for a
wind



i never have a taste for any thing
but genteel company and hate all
description of low life
hence i
account of the society in which i at
present find myself must of
necessity be short
the
reminiscence of the horrid black
hole of a place in which we soldier
be confined of the wretched
creature with whom i be now forced
to keep company of the plowmen
poacher pickpocket who have taken
refuge from poverty or the law as
in truth i have do myself be
enough to make i ashamed even now

fellow get i a glass


get the gentleman a towel for his
hand and serve he a basin of
turtlesoup

if you want to vex he ask he
about he wife the washerwoman who
bate he

be it a towel of you wife
wash mr
toole
i be tell she
wipe you face often with one

ask he why he would not see she
yesterday when she come to the
ship



and so i put to he some other
foolish joke about soapsud hen
peck and flatirons which set
the man into a fury and succeed
in raising a quarrel between we



this victory over the cock of the
vile dunghill obtain i respect
among the wretch among whom i
form part



we passage be very favorable and
in two day we landed at cuxhaven
and before i have be a month in the
electorate i be transport into a
tall and proper young soldier and
have a natural aptitude for
military exercise be soon as
accomplished at the drill as the
old sergeant in the regiment



six week after we arrive in
cuxhaven we be reinforce by
gale regiment of foot from england
and i promise you the sight of
Grogans face be most welcome to
i for it assured i that a friend
be near i

token of acquaintance and it be not

we regiment which be quarter
about stade and Luneberg speedily
have get order to march southwards
towards the rhine where we would
fight the famous battle of minden
it would require a great
philosopher and historian than i be
to explain the cause of the famous
seven year war in which europe be
engaged and indeed it origin have
always appear to i to be so
complicate and the book written
about it so amazingly hard to
understand that i have seldom be
much wise at the end of a chapter
than at the begin and so shall
not trouble you with any personal
disquisition concerning the matter



be these memoir not characterize
by truth i might easily make myself
the hero of some strange and popular
adventure



but i see no one of the high rank
that day than i colonel and a
couple of orderly officer riding by
in the smoke no one on we side
that be
poor corporal be not
generally invited into the company
of commander and the great



but in revenge i see i promise
you some very good company on the
french part for they regiment of
lorraine and royal cravate be
charging we all day
and in the sort
of melee high and low be pretty
equally received
i hate brag
but i cannot help saying that i make
a very close acquaintance with the
colonel of the Cravates



and finished off a poor little
ensign so young slender and
small that a blow from i pigtail
would have dispatch he



and in the poor ensign pocket
find a purse of fourteen louis
door and a silver box of sugar
plum of which the former present
be very agreeable to i



if people would tell they story
of battle in this simple way i
think the because of truth would not
suffer by it
all i know of this
famous fight of minden except from
book be tell here above

Grogans down
Lakenham there be
you company



that be all the epitaph i brave
patron get

i should have left you a hundred
guinea roderick but for a curse
run of i willluck last night at faro



when we come back to we ground
which we presently do he be lying
still but he be dead
some of we
people have already torn off he
epaulet and no doubt have rifle
he purse



after the death of i protector
captain grogan i be forced to
confess that i fell into the very
bad of course and company
in a
foreign country with the enemy
before we and the people
continually under contribution from
one side or the other numberless
irregularity be permitted to the
troop
it be well for gentleman to
talk of the age of chivalry
but
remember the starve brute whom
they lead man nurse in poverty
entirely ignorant make to take
pride in deed of blood man who
can have no amusement but in
drunkenness debauch and plunder
it be with these shock
instrument that you great warrior
and king have be do they
murderous work in the world



the year in which george die
we regiment have the honor to be
present at the battle of warburg
where prince ferdinand once more
completely defeated the frenchman



during the action i lieutenant
mr
Lakenham of Lakenham be
strike by a musketball in the side
he have show no want of courage in
this or any other occasion where he
have be called upon to act against
the french
but this be he first
wound and the young gentleman be
exceedingly frighten by it

here you roderick james
i will
pay you five guinea if you will
carry i into the town which be hard
by those wood



we put the patient to bed and he
paid i the stipulated reward

young surgeon who desire nothing
well than to take himself out of
the fire of the musketry come
presently to dress the wound

i should get half

you share be one guinea

he give you five guinea and i
bloody well expect half

go to the devil

who be you putting into that bed

we have the corporal wounded to
you bringing

corporal

Schicken

nurse
whenever any delicacy be
to be provide for the wound
lieutenant a share be always send
to the bed opposite his and to the
avaricious mane no small annoyance



nor be i the only person in the
house to whom the worthy gentleman
be uncivil
he ordered the fair
Lischen hither and thither make
impertinent love to she abuse she
soup quarreled with she
omelette and grudge the money
which be laid out for his
maintenance so that we hostess
detested he as much as i think
without vanity as she regard i



for if truth must be tell i have
make very deep love to she during i
stay under she roof as be always i
way with woman of whatever age or
degree of beauty
do not think i
very cruel and heartless lady
this heart of Lischens be like
many a town which have be storm
and occupied several time before i
come to invest it



i begin to reflect how pleasant i
quarter be to i and that i be
much well here than crawling under
an odious tent with a parcel of
tipsy soldier or going the night
round or rising long before
daybreak for drill
i determined
that i never would join mine again

i be promote lieutenant
i have come
to take i leave of you
i intend
to have you paper and purse

you great scoundrel
you mutinous
dog
what do you mean by dressing
yourself in i regimentals
as sure
as i name Lakenham when we get
back to the regiment i will have you
soul cut out of you body

hark you sir
no more noise or you
be a dead man



i companion treated i with great
civility and ask i a thousand
question about england which i
answer as good i might
but this
best i be bound to say be bad
enough
i know nothing about
england and i invent a thousand
story which i told he
described
the king and the minister to he
said the british ambassador in
berlin be i uncle and promised i
acquaintance a letter of
recommendation to he

what be you uncle name

OGrady

oh yes of course ambassador
OGrady

it hurt i feeling to be oblige
to commune with such wretch but
the stern necessity of war demand
man continually and hence these
recruiter whom you see market in
human flesh
they get fiveand
twenty thaler a man from we
government for every man they bring
in
for fine man for man like
you
they would go as high as hundred

this be a very good inn
shall we
stop for dinner

this may be a very good inn for
germany but it would not pass in
old ireland
Corbach be only a
league off let we push on for
Corbach

do you want to see the lovely
woman in europe

ah
you sly rogue i see that will
influence you

the place seem more a farm than an
innyard

the people be great farmer as
well as innkeeper

party of french horseman be about
the country and one cannot take too
many precaution against such
villain

well we meal be a frugal one but
a soldier have many a time a bad

where be the beauty you promised i

laughing and looking
hard at roderick
it be i joke
i be tire and
do not care to go farther
there be
not pretty woman here than that
if she will not suit you fancy i
friend then you must wait awhile

upon i word sir i think you have
act very coolly

i have act as i think fit

sir i be a british officer

it be a lie
you be a deserter
you be an impostor sir
you lie
and folly have confirmed this to i
you pretend to carry dispatch to a
general who have be dead these ten
month
you have an uncle who be an
ambassador and whose name you do not
know
will you join and take the
bounty sir or will you be given
up

neither

advance a step and i send this
bullet into you brain

i volunteer



at the close of the seven year war
the prussian army so renowned for
it disciplined valor be
officer and underofficered by
native prussian it be true but
be composed for the most part of
man hired or stolen like myself
from almost every nation in europe
the desert to and fro be
prodigious



the life the private soldier lead be
a frightful one to any but the man
of iron courage and endurance
the
punishment be incessant



i be not near so unhappy in spite
of all as i have be on i first
enlist in ireland
at least
there will be no one of i
acquaintance who will witness i
shame and that be the point which i
have always care for most



i reasoned with myself thus
now
you be catch there be no use in
repine make the good of you
situation and get all the pleasure
you can out of it
there be a
thousand opportunity of plunder
offered to the soldier in war time
out of which he can get both
pleasure and profit
make use of
these and be happy




i do not intend to make a history of
battle in the prussian any more
than in the english service
i do
i duty in they as well as another
and there be not a brave
clever handsome and i must
own wickeder soldier in the
prussian army

i have form myself to the condition
of the proper fight beast
on a
day of action i be savage and
happy

you be a gallant soldier and have
evidently come of good stock
but
you be idle dissolute and
unprincipled
you have do a deal
of harm to the man
and for all
you talent and bravery i be sure
you will come to no good

i hope colonel bulow be mistaken
regarding i character
i have
fallen into bad company it be true
but i have only do as other
soldier have do
and above all
i have never have a kind friend and
protector before to whom i might
show that i be worthy of well
thing
the colonel may say i be a
ruine lad and send i to the
devil
but be sure of this i would
go to the devil to serve the
regiment



soon after the war end we
regiment be garrison in the
capital the least dull perhaps of
all the town of prussia
but that
do not say much for it gaiety

make for good society polish
obliging a libertine without
prejudice fond of woman of good
food of high play prudent and
discreet

he speak italian and french
indifferently

reason to fancy this monsieur de

appearance the nobleness of he
manner i feel it impossible to keep
disguise with he
you who have
never be out of you country know
little what it be to hear a friendly
voice in captivity
and there be a
many a man that will understand the
because of the burst of feeling which
be about to take place

as he speak
bursting into tear
sir i have a confession to make
i
be an irishman and i name be
roderick james
i be abducted into
the prussian army two year ago and
now i have be put into you

the minister of police to serve as
a watch upon you action of which
i be to give information to the same

the rascal
they think to catch
i do they
why young man i
chief conspiracy be a farobank
but the king be so jealous that he
will see a spy in every person who
come to he miserable capital in
the great sandy desert here



and i think he be as much affected
as i be at thus finding one of his
kindred
for he too be an exile
from home and a friendly voice a
look bring the old country back
to he memory again and the old
day of he boyhood

i would give five year of i life to
see the old country again the
greenfield and the river and the
old round tower and the bury
place

i lad i have be in every
service
and between ourselves owe
money in every capital in europe
i
have be a roll stone
play
play have be i ruin
that and
beauty
the woman have make a fool
of i i dear boy
i be a soft
hearted creature and this minute
at sixtytwo have no more command
of myself than when peggy ODwyer
make a fool of i at sixteen

the card be now i only
livelihood
sometimes i be in luck
and then i lay out i money in these
trinket you see
it be property
look you and the only way i have
find of keeping a little about i
when the luck go against i why
i dear i diamond go to the
pawnbroker and i wear paste
do
you understand the card

i can play as soldier do but have
no great skill

we will practice in the morning i
boy and i will put you up to a thing
or two worth knowing



i carry i little report to
captain Galgenstein at the garden
house outside the town where he give
i rendezvous
these report of
course be arranged between i and
the chevalier beforehand
i be
instruct and it be always the
good way to tell as much truth as
i story would possible bear

he go to church regularly he be
very religious and after hear
mass come home to breakfast
then
he take an airing in he chariot
till dinner which be serve at
noon
after dinner he write his
letter if he have any letter to
write
but he have very little to do
in this way
he letter be to the
austrian envoy with whom he
correspond but who do not
acknowledge he
and be written
in english or course i look over
he shoulder
he generally write
for money
he make he party with
Calsabigi the lottery contractor
the russian attach two from the
english embassy i lords Deuceace
and punter who play a jeu denfer
and a few more
he win often but
not always
lord Deuceace be a very
fine player
the chevalier elliott
the english minister sometimes
come on which occasion the
secretary do not play



it be agreed that i should keep i
character of valet that in the
presence of stranger i should not
know a word of english that i
should keep good lookout on the
trump when i be serving the
champagne and punch about
and
have a remarkably fine eyesight
and a great natural aptitude i be
speedily able to give i dear
benefactor much assistance against
he opponent at the green table



simplicity be we secret
everything successful be simple
if for instance i wipe the dust
off a chair with i napkin it be
to show that the enemy be strong in
diamond
if i push it he have an
ace king
if i said punch or
wine i lord
heart be mean
if wine or punch
club
if i
blow i nose it be to indicate
that there be another confederate
employed by the adversary
and then
i warrant you some pretty trial of
skill would take place
the prince
of Turbingen although so young have
a very great skill and cleverness
with the card in every way
and it
be only from hearing ritter von
brandenburg who come with he yawn
three time when the chevalier have
the ace of trump that i know we
be greek to greek as it be

chevalier though i cannot say how
i believe you have cheated i

i deny you graces accusation and
beg you to say how you have be
cheated

i do not know

you grace owe i seventy thousand
frederics which i have honorably
win

chevalier if you will have you
money now you must fight for it
if you will be patient maybe i will
pay you something another time

you grace if i be so tame as to
take this then i must give up an
honorable and lucrative occupation

i have say all there be to be say
i be at you disposal for whatever
purpose you wish
good night

be he cheated

in so far as i can tell these thing
no
i believe the chevalier win
the money fairly

hmmmmmm

what be the chevalier intention

i be not sure
the prince told he
quite clearly that if he wished to
have the money he would have to
fight for it

meet with the prince of
Turbingen be impossible

the prince left he only that
choice

will you be able to return here
tomorrow without arousing suspicion

tell they i intend to demand
satisfaction from the prince

but they will prevent a meet at
whatever the cost

have no fear
it will come out well
for i

i believe they will deport you

i have face that problem before

but if they send you away then
what be to become of i

make you mind easy you shall not
be left behind i warrant you
do
take a last look at you barracks

and out of it you shall go

but how sir

the king have determined to send the
chevalier out of the country

when be he to go

have he send the challenge yet

to

then this must be do tomorrow

what be to be do

and before dinner
when he come
out to he carriage a couple of
gendarme will mount the box and
the coachman will get he order to

life
i have a gentleman to wait

player who be matching some
thousands out of he millions
against we all which be there on
the baize



we principle be
play grandly
honorably
be not of course cast
down at losing

not eager at winning as mean soul
be



when the duke of courland bring
fourteen lackey each with bag of
florin and challenged we bank to

florin in bank or two hundred

play in which we bank be at one
time reduced to two hundred and
three ducat we win seventeen
thousand florin off he



nor need i mention i success
among the fair portion of the
creation
one of the most
accomplished the tall the most
athletic and the handsome
gentleman in europe as i be then
a young fellow of i figure could
not fail of have advantage which
a person of i spirit know very well
how to we



charming Schuvaloff



Blackeyed Sczortarska



dark valdez

do you expect i to believe that
you lover bring you here tonight

yes
he bring i in he carriage
and he will call for i at midnight

and he do not care about i

he be only curious to know who you
be

if he love be like mine he would
not permit you to come here

he love i as i love you

will he wish to know the detail of
this night

he will believe that it will please
i if he ask about it and i shall
tell he everything except some
circumstance which might humiliate
he



tender Hegenheim



brilliant Langeac

i will put in on you myself

there you be dressed by i hand
it be nearly the same thing
but
despite the fineness and
transparency of the skin the little
fellow please i less well in
costume
it seem that this
cover degrade he or degrade
i one of the other

both i angel
it be love who
invent these little jacket
for
he have to ally himself with
precaution

i entered here monsieur at a bad
moment for you
it seem that you
love this lady

certainly monseigneur do not
you excellency consider she worthy
of love

perfectly so
and what be more i
will tell you that i love she and
that i be not of a humor to put up
with rival

very well
now that i know it i
will no longer love she

then you yield to i

on the instant
everyone must yield
to such a nobleman as you

very well
but a man who yield
take to he leg

that be a trifle strong

take to you leg low irish dog

you excellency have wantonly
insult i
that be so i
conclude that you hate i
monseigneur and that hence you
would be glad to remove i from the
number of the live
in this wish
i can and will satisfy you
excellency



it be i unrivaled skill with
sword and pistol and readiness to
use they that maintained the
reputation of the firm

i see that you be without you
sword but i believe you be a man
of mettle
will you give i
satisfaction

i shall be delight
but you have
lost and you must pay i the money
before we meet for after all you
cannot pay i when you be dead

i will undertake to pay you the
louis but only tomorrow morning at
the meet

i may have be mistaken but i mean
to make you pay deadly for you
brutality

it be distasteful to kill a
scoundrel that should be work for
a hangman

to risk one life against such
people be an imposition

i risk nothing for i be certain to
kill he

certain

perfectly certain because i shall
make he tremble

you have only to pace yourself at
ten pace difference and fire
first
the space between these two
tree be the place where i choose to
walk back and forth
you may walk
too if you wish when it be i turn
to fire

but we must decide who be to have
the first shot

there be no need of that
i never
fire first
and in any case you
have that right

with the great
composure
you missed i sir
i be sure you
would
try again



thus be will be see that we life
for all it splendor be one of
extreme difficulty and danger
require high talent and courage
for success and sudden and
unexpected departure

i be posting monsieur and
furthermore i be a foreigner

monsieur here in saxony the post
have no special right and if you be
a foreigner you must admit that you
have no great claim than mine
since i be in i own country



the lady be passionately fond of
play and hence would often arise no
small trouble to we
for the truth
most be tell that the lady loved
to play but not to pay
the point
of honor be not understood by the
charming sex
and it be with the
great difficulty that we could
keep they from the table could get
they money if they lost or if they
paid prevent they from use the
most furious and extraordinary means
of revenge



on this evening the lady of high
rank after i have win a considerable
sum in diamond and pearl from she
send she lover with a band of cut
throat to waylay i



after making suitable arrangement
for the chevalier burial in
proper accord with he church i
travele to spa which be now in
season alone to continue i
profession which formerly have the
support of i friend and mentor



i be by this time one of the good
known character in europe
and the
fame of i exploit i duel i
courage at play would bring crowd
round i in any public society where
i appear



the passion for play be strong
than the passion for gallantry
the
gamester at spa have neither time to
stop to consider the merit of a
woman nor the courage to make
sacrifice for she



in evoking the recollection of
these day i have nothing but
pleasure
i would if i could say as
much of a lady who will henceforth
play a considerable part in the
drama of i life i mean the
countess of cosgrove whose fatal
acquaintance i make at spa very
soon after the tragic event which
cause i to quit germany



victoria countess of cosgrove

countess and a viscountess in she
own right



she be the wife of she cousin the
right honorable sir william reginald
cosgrove knight of the bath and
minister to george and george
of several of the small court of
europe



she be the mother to viscount
brookside a melancholy deserted
little boy about whom he father
be more than indifferent and whom
he mother never see



i make sir william Cosgroves
acquaintance as usual at the play
table
one could not but admire the
spirit and gallantry with which he
pursue he favorite pastime
for
though worn out with gout and a
myriad of disease a cripple
wheeled about in a chair and
suffering pang of agony yet you
would see he every morning and
every evening at he post behind the
delightful green cloth

hang it mr
roderick james you
have no more manner than a barber
and i think i black footman have
be well educated than you
but
you be a young fellow of
originality and pluck and i like
you sir
because you seem
determined to go to the devil by a
way of you own

i be oblige to observe sir william
cosgrove that since you be bound
for the next world much sooner than
i be i will depend on you to get
comfortable quarter arranged for
i

indeed you be right sir
look at
i
marriage have added forty year
to i life
i be dying a wornout
cripple at the age of fifty
when
i take off lady cosgrove there be
no man of i year who look so
young as myself
fool that i be
i have enough with i pension
perfect freedom the good society in
europe and i give up all these
and marry and be miserable
take
a warn from i mr
roderick and
stick to the trump
do anything
but marry

would you have i spend i life all
alone

in truth sir yes but if you must
marry then marry a virtuous drudge

the milkmaid daughter

well why not a milkmaid daughter
no man of sense need restrict
himself or deny himself a single
amusement for he wife sake
on
the contrary if he select the
animal properly he will choose such
a one as shall be no bar to his
pleasure but a comfort in he hour
of annoyance
for instance i have
get the gout
who tend i
hire
valet who rob i whenever he have
the power
i wife never come near
i
what friend have i
none in
the wide world
man of the world
as you and i be do not make
friend and we be fool for we
pain

i lady be a weak woman but she be
i mistress
she be a fool but she
have get the good of one of the
good head in christendom
she be
enormously rich but somehow i have
never be so poor as since i
married she
i think to well
myself and she have make i
miserable and killed i and she
will do as much for i successor
when i be go

have she ladyship a very large
income



despite i friend strong warn
i resolve to become acquaint with
he lady
sir william cosgrove be
die
he widow would be a rich
prize
why should i not win she
and with she the means of making
in the world that figure which i
genius and inclination desire
when i determine i look upon the
thing as do

charming lady tell i the truth and
earn i gratitude
have you a
lover

no

have you have one

never

but for a time
a pass fancy

not even that

how can i believe that there be not
a man who have inspired desire in
you

not one

have you not a man whom you value

that man have perhaps not yet be
born

what
you have not meet a man worthy
of you attention

many worthy of attention
but
value be something more
i could
value only someone whom i loved

then you have never loved
you
heart be empty

you word empty make i laugh
be it fortunate or unfortunate
if
it be fortunate i congratulate
myself
if it be unfortunate i do
not care for i be not aware of it

it be nonetheless a misfortune and
you will know it when you love

but if when i love i be unhappy i
will know that i empty heart be i
good fortune

that be true but it seem to i
impossible that you should be
unhappy in love

it be only too possible
love
require a mutual harmony which be
difficult and it be even more
difficult to make it last

i agree
but god put we on earth to
take that risk

man may need to do that and find
it amuse
but a girl be bound by
other law

i believe you and i see i must
hasten to leave for otherwise i
shall become the unhappy of man

how so

by loving you with no hope of
possessing you

you want i heart

it be i only object

to make i wretched in two week

to love you until death
to
subscribe to all you command

the amuse thing be that you
deceive i without knowing if it be
true that you love i

deceive someone without knowing it
be something new for i
if i do
not know it i be innocent

but you deceive i nonetheless if i
believe you for it will not be in
you power to love i when you love
i no longer

be so good as to tell i with whom
you think you be

with a woman who be completely
charming be she a princess or a
woman of the low condition and
who regardless of she rank will
show i some kindness tonight

and if she do not choose to show
you some kindness

then i will respectfully take leave
of she

you will do as you please
it seem
to i that such a matter can hardly
be discuss until after people know
each other
do you not agree

yes but i be afraid of be
deceive

poor man
and for that reason you
want to begin where people end

i ask only a payment on account
today after that you will find
i undemanding obedient and
discreet

will we always leave it at this

always i dear one never any
**further/far
love be a child to be
pacify with trifle
full diet
can only kill it

i know good than you do
love
want a more substantial fare and
if it be stubbornly withhold it
wither away

we abstinence make we love
immortal
if i loved you a quarter
of an hour ago now i should love
you even more
but i should love
you less if you exhausted i joy by
satisfying all i desire

let we give each other complete
happiness and let we be sure that
as many time as we satisfy we
desire they will each time be born
anew

i husband have convinced i of the
contrary

sir william cosgrove be a man who be
die and yet i envy he more than
any man in christendom
he enjoy a
privilege of which i be deprive
he may take you in he arm whenever
he please and no veil keep his
sense he eye he soul from
enjoy you beauty

shall i tell you something i
believe what be called love come
after the union and i be
surprise when i husband making i
a woman make i know it only by
pain unaccompanied by any pleasure
i see that i imagining have stand
i in good stead
and so we
become only friend seldom sleep
together and arouse no curiosity
in each other yet on good term for
a while as whenever he wanted i i
be at he service but since the
offer be not season with love
he find it tasteless and seldom
demanded it

i dear love
enough
i beg
you
stop believe in you
experience
you have never known
love
i very soul be leaving i
catch it on you lip and give i
yours



to make a long story short she
ladyship and i be in love six
hour after we meet
and after i once
get into she ladyship good grace
i find innumerable occasion to
improve i intimacy and be
scarcely ever out of she company



i shall never forget the
astonishment of sir william cosgrove
when on one summer evening as he
be issue out to the playtable
in he sedanchair she ladyship
barouche and four come driving into
the courtyard of the house which
they inhabit and in that
carriage by she ladyship side
sit no other than the vulgar irish
adventurer as she be please to
call i

without you i dear i might
have die without ever knowing love
inexpressible love
god of nature
bitterness than which nothing be
sweet sweetness than which
nothing be more bitter
divine
monster which can only be defined by
paradox

let i give a thousand kiss to
that heavenly mouth which have tell
i that i be happy

as soon as i see you loved i i be
please and i give you every
opportunity to fall more in love
with i be certain that for i
part i would never love you
but
after we first kiss i find that i
have no power over myself
i do not
know that one kiss could matter so
much



we then spent an hour in the most
eloquent silence except that from
time to time she ladyship cry
out
oh i god
be it true i
be not dreaming




sir william cosgrove with he
complication of ill be die
before we by inch
he be
continually tinker up by doctor
and what with i usual luck he
might be restored to health and live
i do not know how many year
if
cosgrove would not die where be
the use of i purse he lady
but
i fear be to prove groundless
for on that very night patient
nature would claim she account

good evening mr
james have you
do with i lady

i beg you pardon

come come sir
i be a man who
would rather be known as a cuckold
than a fool

hunt have introduced i
into the company of you lady to
advise i on a religious matter of

lady Cosgroves
wealth may be great but be i not of
a generous nature enough to use it
worthily
she rank be lofty but
not so lofty as i ambition
i will
be sworn to muster just as much
regard for i lady cosgrove as you
ever show she
and if i win she
and wear she when you be dead and
go corbleu knight do you think
that it will be the fear of you

long i may keep you waiting

sir let those laugh that win

i be sorry for you mr

mr

die at spa in the kingdom of
belgium the right honorable sir
william cosgrove knight of the
bath member of parliament for
cosgrove and devonshire and many
year he Majestys representative
at various european court
he hath
left behind he a name which be
endear to all he friend for he
manifold virtue and talent a
reputation justly acquired in the
service of he majesty and an
inconsolable widow to deplore his
loss



year from that day on the
fifteenth of may in the year
i have the honor and happiness to
lead to the altar victoria countess
of cosgrove widow of the late right
honorable sir william cosgrove

i have procure he Majestys
gracious permission to add the name
of i lovely lady to i own and
henceforward assumed the title of
james cosgrove

i lord brookside come and embrace
you papa

he i father
i would as soon call
one of you ladyship footman
papa

lord brookside you have offended
you father

mother you have offended i father



it be a declaration of war to i
as i see at once
though i declare i
be will enough to have live
with he on term of friendliness
but as man serve i i serve they
who can blame i for i after
quarrel with this young reprobate
or lay upon i shoulder the evil
which afterwards befall



after we have received the
congratulations of we friend in
london i and victoria set off to
visit we country estate castle
Hackton where i have never as yet
set foot



the first day of a marriage be
commonly very trying
and i have
known couple who live together
like turtledoves for the rest of
they live peck each other eye
out almost during the honeymoon
i
do not escape the common lot
in
we journey westwards i lady
cosgrove choose to quarrel with i
because i have pull out a pipe of
tobacco
lady cosgrove be a
haughty woman and i hate pride and
i promise you that in this instant
i overcome this vice in she



i have not arrive at the pitch of
prosperity and have at thirty
year of age by i own merit and
energy raised myself to one of the
high social position that any
man in england could occupy i
determined to enjoy myself as
become a man of quality for the
remainder of i life



but it be not mean for i to
finish i life as a man of quality
and position
indeed i be one of
those born clever enough at gain
a fortune but incapable of keeping
one
for the quality and energy
which lead a man to accept the
first be often the very cause of
he ruin in the latter case
indeed
i know of no other reason for the
misfortune which finally befall i



at the end of the year lady
cosgrove present i with a son
patrick cosgrove i called he in
compliment to i royal ancestry but
what more have i to leave he than a
noble name



we spent the season in london at we
house in berkeley square



she ladyship and i live for a
while pretty separate when in
london
she preferred quiet or to
say the truth i preferred it be
a great friend to a modest tranquil
behavior in woman and a taste for
the domestic pleasure



besides she be a mother and have
great comfort in the dressing
educating and dandle of we
little patrick for whose sake it be
fit that she should give up the
pleasure and frivolity of the
world
so she left that part of the
duty of every family of distinction
to be perform by i



she ladyship conversation with i
be characterize by a stupid
despair or a silly blunder
attempt at force cheerfulness
still more disagreeable
hence we
intercourse be but trifling and i
temptation to carry she into the
world or to remain in she society of
necessity exceedingly small



she would try i temper at home
too in a thousand way
when
requested by i to entertain the
company with conversation wit and
learn of which she be a
mistress
or music of which she be
an accomplish performer she
would as often as not begin to
cry and leave the room
i company
from this of course fancied i be
a tyrant over she
whereas i be
only a severe and careful guardian
of a silly badtempered and weak
minded lady



despite the utter distaste with
which i now regard lady cosgrove
and although i take no particular
pain to disguise i feeling in
general yet she be of such a mean
spirit that she pursue i with she
regard and would kindle up at the
small kind word i speak to she



and in these fit of love she be
the most easy creature in the world
to be persuade and would have
signed away she whole property have
it be possible
and i must
confess it be with very little
attention on i part that i could
bring she into good humor and up
to the very last day of we being
together would be reconciled to i
and fondle i if i addressed she a
single kind word
such be female
inconsistency



she be luckily very fond of she
young son and through he i have
a wholesome and effectual hold on
she
for if in any of she tantrum
or fit of haughtiness she
pretended to have the upperhand to
assert she authority against mine
to refuse to sign such paper as i
might think necessary for the
distribution of we large and
complicate property



i would have master patrick carry
off to chiswick for a couple of
day
and i warrant i he lady
mother could hold out no long and
would agree to anything i proposed



lady cosgrove and i do not quarrel
more than fashionable people do and
for the first three year i never
strike i wife but when i be in
liquor



when i fling the carvingknife at
brookside i be drunk as
everybody present can testify but
as for have any systematic scheme
against the poor lad i can declare
solemnly that beyond merely hate
he i be guilty of no evil towards
he



do what one would to please she i
lady would never be happy or in good
humor
and soon she added a mean
detestable jealousy to all she other
fault and would weep and wring she
hand and threaten to commit
suicide and i know not what



she death would have be no comfort
to i as i leave any person of
common prudence to imagine
for that
scoundrel of a young brookside who
be about to become i great
plague and annoyance would have
inherit every penny of the
property



humble people envy we great man and
fancy that we live be all
pleasure
but the trouble of
poverty the rascality of agent
the quibble of lawyer be endless
i life at this period seem to
consist of nothing but draft of
letter and moneybrokers relative
to the raise of money and the
insure of lady Cosgroves life
and innumerable correspondence with
upholsterer decorator cook
horsekeepers bailiff and
steward



i own dear boy patrick be now
five year old and be the most
polite and engage child ever see
it be a pleasure to treat he with
kindness and distinction
the little
fellow be the pink of fashion
beauty and good breed
in fact
he could not have be otherwise
with the care both he parent
bestow upon he and the
attention which be lavish upon
he in every way



whereas young brookside have grow
to be a very nasty and disrespectful
fellow indeed
in i company he
preserve the most rigid silence
and a haughty scornful demeanor
which be so much the more
disagreeable because there be
nothing in he behavior i could
actually take hold of to find fault
with although he whole conduct be
insolent and supercilious to the
high degree



in addition to this the lad be
fond of spending the chief part of
he time occupied with the musty old
book which he take out of the
library and which i hate to see a
young man of spirit pouring over



the insubordination of that boy be
dreadful
he used to quote passage
of hamlet to he mother which
make she very angry



as it be good to nip vice in the
bud and for a master of a family to
exercise he authority in such a
manner as that there may be no
question about it i take every
opportunity of coming to close
quarter with master brookside



he always choose the day when
company or the clergy or gentry of
the neighborhood be present to
make violent sarcastic and
insolent speech

dear child what a pity it be i be
not dead for you sake
the
Cosgroves would then have a worthy
representative and enjoy all the
benefit of the illustrious blood of
the james of Duganstown would they
not mr
james cosgrove

ah roderick it be a bless to see
that i darling boy have attain a
position i always know be he due
and for which i pinched myself to
educate he
little patrick be a
darling boy and you live in great
splendor but how long will it last
you ladywife know she have a
treasure she could not have have have
she taken a duke to marry she but
if one day she should tire of i
wild roderick and he oldfashion
irish way or if she should die
what future would there be for i
son and grandson

you have not a penny of you own
and cannot transact any business
without the countess signature
upon she death the entire estate
would go to young brookside who
bear you little affection
you
could be penniless tomorrow and
darling patrick at the mercy of he
stepbrother

i shall tell you a secret i shall
not rest until i see you earl of
Duganstown and i grandson a lord
viscount

this head would become a coronet

these thing entail considerable
expense and you will need you
lady bless but the young boy
form the great bond of union
between you and she ladyship and
there be no plan of ambition you
could propose in which she would not
join for the poor lades benefit and
no expense she will not eagerly
incur if it might be any means be
show to tend to he advancement
you have important friend and they
can tell you how these thing be
do



and to be sure i do know someone
who know precisely how these thing
be do and this be the
distinguish solicitor and former
government minister lord west
whose acquaintance i make as i have
so many other at the gaming table

do you happen to know gustavus
adolphus the thirteenth earl of
crab

by name only

well sir this nobleman be one of
the gentleman of he Majestys
closet and one with whom we
rever monarch be on term of
considerable intimacy
i should say
you would be wise to fix upon this
nobleman you chief reliance for the
advancement of you claim to the
viscounty which you propose to get



and for a fivehundred guinea fee
paid to he city lawfirm lord west
kindly arranged a meet with that
old scamp and swindler gustavus
adolphus the thirteenth earl of
crab

mr
cosgrove when i take up a
person he or she be safe
there be
no question about they any more
i
friend be the good people
i
do not mean the most virtuous or
indeed the least virtuous or the
clever or the stupide or the
rich or the best born but the
best in a word people about
whom there be no question
i cannot
promise you how long it will take
you can appreciate it be not an easy
matter
but any gentleman with an
estate and tenthousand ayear
should have a peerage



the strive after this peerage i
consider to have be one of the
most unlucky dealing at this
period
i make unheard of
sacrifice to bring it about
i can
tell you bribe be administered
and in high place too so near
the royal person of he majesty that
you would be astonish be i to
mention what great personage
condescend to receive we loan



i lavish money here and diamond
there



i buy land at ten time there
value



i give repeat entertainment to
those friend to i claim who
be about the royal person be
likely to advance it



i purchased picture and article of
vertu at ruinous price



i lost many a bet to the royal
duke he Majestys brother



one of the main cause of expense
which this ambition of mine entail
upon i be the fit out and
arming of a company of infantry from
the Hackton estate which i offered
to i gracious sovereign for the
campaign against the american
rebel
these troop superbly
equip and clothed be embark
at portsmouth in the year



and the patriotism of the gentleman
who raised they be so acceptable at
court that on be presented by i
lord crab he majesty condescend
to notice i particularly and said

that be right mr
cosgrove raise
another company and go with they
too



crab be really one of the most
entertain fellow in the world
and i take a sincere pleasure in his
company besides the interest and
desire i have in cultivate the
society of the most important
personage of the realm

if i be you mr
cosgrove i
should mind i horse and tailor
and not trouble myself about
letter

dr
johnson i think you misbehave
most grossly treat i opinion
with no more respect than those of a
schoolboy
you fancy sir you know
a great deal more than i because
you quote you aristotle and
plato but can you tell i which
horse will win at epsom down next
week
can you shoot the ace of
spade ten time without missing
if so talk about aristotle and
plato with i

do you know who you be speaking to

hold you tongue mr
boswell i have
no right to brag of i greek
gentleman and he have answer i
very well

do you know ever a rhyme for
aristotle

port if you please

waiter bring on of captain james
rhyme for aristotle



and we have six rhyme for aristotle
before we left the coffee house that
evening

henri this be mr
james cosgrove
who wish to arrange a dinner party
next week for sixty guest

i be at you service mr
cosgrove
how much do you wish to spend

as much as possible

as much as possible

yes for i wish to entertain
splendidly

all the same you must name an
amount

it be entirely up to you
i want
the good

may i suggest five hundred guinea

will that be enough

last month the duke of suffolk
spent no more

all right five hundred guinea



the life i be leading be that of a
happy man but i be not happy

papa please do not flog brookside
today
it be not he fault
really be be not



by now young brookside be of so
wild savage and insubordinate a
nature that i never have the least
regard for he
as he grow up to be
a man he hatred for i assumed an
intensity quite wicked to think of
and which i promise you i return
with interest

look you now mister roderick james
from this moment on i will submit
to no far chastisement from you
do you understand that

give i that pistol

take heed mister james
i will
shoot you if you lay hand on i
now or ever again
be that
entirely clear to you sir



i decided at once to give up that
necessary part of he education
in truth he then become the most
violent dare disobedient
scapegrace that ever cause an
affectionate parent pain
he be
certainly the most incorrigible



twice or thrice reverend hunt
attempted to punish i lord
brookside
but i promise you the
rogue be too strong for he and
leveled the oxford man to the
ground with a chair greatly to the
delight of little patrick who cry
out
bravo Brooksy
thump he
thump he




with the child brookside be
strange to say pretty tractable
he take a like to the little
fellow i like he the more he
said because he be half a
cosgrove




another day it be patricks
birthday we be giving a grand
ball and gala at Hackton and it be
time for i patrick to make his
appearance among we

do not you think he fit i shoe
very well sir richard wargrave

from the manner in which i love this
child i lord you ought to know
how i would have loved he elder
brother have he prove worthy of any
mother affection

madam i have borne as long as
mortal could endure the i will
treatment of the insolent irish
upstart whom you have taken into
you bed
it be not only the
lowness of he birth and the
general brutality of he manner
which disgust i but the shameful
nature of he conduct towards you
ladyship he brutal and
ungentlemanlike behavior he open
infidelity he habit of
extravagance intoxication he
shameless robbery and swindling of
i property and yours
it be these
insult to you which shock and annoy
i more than the ruffian infamous
conduct to myself
i would have
stand by you ladyship as i
promise but you seem to have taken
latterly you husband part
and
as i cannot personally chastise this
lowbred ruffian who to we shame
be it speak be the husband of i
mother and as i cannot bear to
witness he treatment of you and
loathe he horrible society as if it
be the plague i be determined to
quit i native country at least
during he detested life or during
i own



if i have murdered i lord i could
scarcely have be received with
more shameful obloquy and slander
than now follow i in town and
country
i friend fell away from
i and a legend arise of i cruelty
to i stepson



i reception at court be scarcely
more cordial
on paying i respect
to i sovereign at st
james he
majesty pointedly ask i when i
have news of lord brookside
on
which i reply with no ordinary
presence of mind

sire i lord brookside have set sail
to fight the rebel against you
Majestys crown in america
do
you majesty desire that i should
send another company to aid he

speaking very
quietly
let i tell you sir that you
conduct have be very odiously
represent to the king and have
form the subject of royal comment
the king have say influence by
these representation that you be
the most disreputable man in the
three kingdom and a dishonor to
you name and country

hear i out please
it have be
intimate to he majesty that you
have raised the american company for
the sole purpose of get the
young viscount to command it and so
get rid of he
and **further/far that
you have paid the very man in the
company who be ordered to dispatch
he in the first general action

thus it be that i loyalty be
rewarded and i sacrifice in favor
of i country view

as for you ambitious hope
regarding the irish peerage he
majesty have also let it be known
that you have be lead astray by
that lord crab who like to take
money but who have no more influence
to get a coronet than to procure a
popes tiara
and if you have it
in mind to call upon lord crab you
will be disappoint
he left for
the continent on tuesday and may be
away for several month

appear before he majesty and clear
myself of the imputation against

government and to ask when the
reward that have be promise i
the title hold by i ancestor be
again to be revived in i person

have you do mr
cosgrove

yes

well mr
cosgrove i will answer you
point by point
the king be
exceedingly averse to make peer as
you know
you claim as you call
they have be laid before he and
he Majestys gracious reply be
that you be the most impudent man
in he dominion and merit a
halter rather than a coronet
as
for withdrawing you support from
we you be perfectly welcome to
carry yourself whithersoever you
please
and now as i have a great
deal of occupation perhaps you will
do i the favor to retire or tell
i if there be anything else in the
world in which i can oblige you



the news of he Majestys disregard
be not long in get around
and in a very short time all the
bill come down upon i together
all the bill i have be contracting
for the year of i marriage
i
will not cite they amount
it be
frightful
i be bound up in an
inextricable toil of bill and
debt or mortgage and insurance
and all the horrible evil attendant
upon they



be it i own want of style or i
want of a fortune
i know not
now
i be arrive at the height of i
ambition but both i skill and i
luck seem to be desert i
everything i touched crumble in i
hand
every speculation i have
failed
every agent i trusted
deceive i
i income be saddle
with hundreds of annuity and
thousands of lawyer charge and i
feel the net draw closer and
closer around i and no means to
extricate myself from it toil
all i scheme have turn out
failure



i wife moody despondency make i
house and home not overpleasant
hence i be driven a good deal
abroad where as play be the
fashion in every club tavern and
assembly i of course be oblige
to resume i old habit and to
commence as an amateur those game
at which i be once unrivaled in
europe



i have a run of i willluck at play and
be forced to meet i loss by the
most shameful sacrifice to the
moneylender and be compel to
borrow largely upon i wife
annuity ensure she ladyship
life which be the condition for
every loan against she property

you wife life be as well known
among the insurance society in
london as any woman in christendom
and i be sorry to say there be not
one of they will to place another
policy against she ladyship life
one of they even have the impudence
to suggest that you treatment of
the countess do not render she life
worth a year purchase



in the midst of i difficulty i
promise to buy a little horse for
i dear little patrick which be to
be a present for he eighth
birthday that be now coming on
i
may have have i fault but no man
shall dare to say of i that i be

be worthy of the two noble family
from whom he be descend and i
do not know what high hope i have for

fond anticipation as to he future
success and figure in the world but
stern fate have determined that i
should leave none of i race behind

when i go to the
lades room this morning he bed be
empty
one of the cook said she
see he go away before daybreak
he
must have slipped through i room
while i be asleep

you will not whip i will you papa



the doctor be called but what
do a doctor avail in a contest
with the grim invincible enemy
such as come could only confirm we
despair by they account of the poor
childes case
he spine be
injured the low half of he be
dead when they laid he in bed at
home
the rest do not last long
god help i
he remain yet for
two day with we and a sad comfort
it be to think he be in no pain

papa i beg you and mama to pardon
i for any act of disobedience i
have be guilty of towards you

oh i little angel you have do
nothing for which you need pardon

the rebel

be he all right papa

yes he be fine

Brooksy be good than you papa
he used not to swear so and he
taught i many good thing while you
be away

i beg you not to quarrel so but to
love each other so that we might
meet again in heaven where Brooksy
told i quarrelsome people never go



at last after two day he die
there he lay the hope of i family
the pride of i manhood the link
which keep i and i lady cosgrove
together



i will not tell you with what splendor
we bury he but what avail be
undertaker feather and herald
trumpery



lady cosgrove always vaporish and
nervous after we bless boyo
catastrophe become more agitated
than ever and plunge into devotion
with so much fervor that you would
have fancied she almost distract
at time



she imagined she see vision
she
said an angel from heaven told she
that patricks death be a
punishment to she for she neglect of
she firstborn
then she would
declare that brookside be dead



by now i financial affair be
near to ruin
i could not get a
guinea from any moneydealer in
london
we rent be in the hand
of receiver by this time and it
be as much as i could do to get
enough money from the rascal to pay
i winemerchants they bill
we
property be hamper and often as
i applied to i lawyer and agent
for money would come a reply
demanding money of i for debt and
pretend claim which the rapacious
rascal said they have on i



i mother be the only person who
in i misfortune remain faithful
to i indeed she have always
speak of i in i true light as a
martyr to the rascality of other
and a victim of i own generous and
confide temper



she be an invaluable person to i
in i house which would have be
at rack and ruin before but for she
spirit of order and management and
she excellent economy in the
government of i rapidly dwindle
household staff



if anything could have saved i from
the consequence of villainy in
other it would have be the
admirable prudence of that worthy
creature



she never go to bed until all the
house be quiet and all the candle
out
you may fancy that this be a
matter of some difficulty with a man
of i habit who have commonly a
dozen of jovial fellow to drink
with i every night and who
seldom for i part go to bed
sober



many and many a night when i be
unconscious of she attention have
that good soul pulled i boot off
and see i laid by i servant snug
in bed and carry off the candle
herself



and be the first in the
morning too to bring i i drink
of small beer
it be i mother
pride that i could drink more than
any man in the country



i mother discovered that always
before i ladywife choose to write
letter to she milliner she have
need of lemon to make she drink as
she said and this fact be
mention to i kind of set i
athinking

read letter
aloud
this day three year ago i last
hope and pleasure in life be taken
from i and i dear child be
called to heaven
where be his
neglected brother whom i suffer
to grow up unheeded by i side and
whom the tyranny of the monster to
whom i be unite drive to exile
and perhaps to death
i pray the
child be still alive and safe
charles brookside
come to the aide
of a wretched mother who
acknowledge she crime she coldness
towards you and now bitterly pay
for she error
what suffering
what humiliation have i have to
endure
i be a prisoner in i own
hall
i should fear poison but
then i know the wretch have a sordid
interest in keeping i alive and
that i death would be the signal
for he ruin
but i dare not stir
without i odious hideous vulgar
gaoler the horrid irish woman who
purse i every step
i be locked
into i chamber at night like a
felon and only suffer to leave it
when ordered into the presence of i
lord to be present at he orgy
with he booncompanions and to
hear he odious converse as he
lapse into the disgusting madness
of intoxication




it be not possible to recover the
name for whom the note be intended
but it be clear that to add to all
i perplexity three year after
i poor childes death i wife
whose vagary of temper and wayward
folly i have borne with for twelve
year wanted to leave i
i
decided it good not to reveal to she
ladyship we discovery that we
might still intercept and uncover
far scheme with might be afoot



yet i be bound to be on i guard
that she should not give i the
slip
have she left i i be ruined
the next day
i set i mother to
keep sharp watch over the mood of
she ladyship and you may be sure
that she assistance and surveillance
be invaluable to i
if i have
paid twenty spy to watch she lady
i should not have be half so well
serve as by the disinterested care
and watchfulness of i excellent
mother



i lady Cosgroves relationship with
i be a singular one
she life be
passed in a series of crackbrained
sort of alternation between love and
hatred for i
we would quarrel for
a fortnight then we should be
friend for a month together
sometimes
one day i be joking
she and asking she whether she
would take the water again whether
she have find another lover and so
forth
she suddenly burst out into
tear and after a while said to
i

roderick you know well enough that
i have never loved but you
be i
ever so wretched that a kind word
from you do not make i happy
ever so angry but the least offer
of goodwill on you part do not
bring i to you side
do i not
give a sufficient proof of i
affection for you in bestow one
of the fine fortune of england
upon you
have i repined or rebuke
you for the way you have wasted it
no i loved you too much and too
fondly
i have always loved you
from the first moment i see you i
see you bad quality and tremble
at you violence
but i could not
help loving you
i married you
though i know i be seal i own
fate in do so and in spite of
reason and duty
what sacrifice do
you want from i
i be ready to
make any so you will but love i
or if not that at least you will
gently we i



i be in a particularly good humor
that day and we have a sort of
reconciliation

depend on it artful hussy have some
other scheme in she head now



the old lady be right and i
swallowed the bait which she
ladyship have prepared to entrap i
as simply as any gudgeon take a
hook



i have hired a moneybroker
especially to find some means of i
making a loan
after several month
without success it be with some
considerable interest that i
received he visit

i have good news for you mr
cosgrove
the firm of Bracegirdle
and Chatwick in the city of london
be prepare to lend you
pound pledge against you
interest in the Edric mine
they
will redeem the encumbrance against
the property which amount to some
pound and take a twenty
year working lease on the mine
they will lend you the pound
against the lease income
which they will apply to the loan as
it come in and they will make a
charge of per annum interest on
the outstanding loan balance

mr
newcombe i have make some
difficult loan during the past few
year at very onerous term but
a year interest seem very stiff
indeed

consider you financial
circumstance mr
cosgrove it have
be impossible to find anyone at
all prepare to do any business with
you
i think you may count yourself
lucky to have this opportunity
but obviously if you would reject
this offer i shall keep trying to
find a good one

i be prepare to accept the term
mr
newcombe

there be a few other point we
should discuss
the loan agreement
can only be executed by she
ladyship signature and provide
that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
assure of she ladyship freewill
in giving she signature

provide that they can be assure of
she ladyship freewill
be you
serious

may i be quite frank with you

yes of course

mister Bracegirdle said to i that
he have hear she ladyship life in
some fear of she life and meditate
a separation in which case she
might later repudiate any document
signed by herself while in durance
and subject they at any rate to a
doubtful and expensive litigation
they be quite insistent on this
point and said they must have
absolute assurance of she ladyship
perfect freewill in the transaction
before they would advance a shilling
of they capital

i see

when i ask they in what form they
would accept she ladyship
assurance they said that they be
only prepare to accept they if she
ladyship confirm she written
consent by word of mouth in they
presence at they countinghouse in
birchin lane london
i request
they come here and save she
ladyship and yourself the
inconvenience of the trip to london
but they decline saying that they
do not wish to incur the risk of a
visit to castle Hackton to
negotiate as they be aware of how
other respectable party such as
messrs
sharp and salomon have be
treated here

depend on it there be some
artifice
when once you get into
that wicked town you be not safe
there be score of writ out
against you for debt
if you be
taken in london and throw into
prison you case be hopeless

mother dear we be now living off
we own beef and mutton
we have to
watch lady cosgrove within and the
bailiff without
there be certain
situation in which people cannot
dictate they own term
and faith
we be so pressed now for money
that i would sign a bond with old
nick himself if he would provide a
good round sum
with this money we
can settle we principal debt and
make a fresh start

roderick you must listen to i
as
soon as they have you in london
they will get the good of i poor
innocent lad
and the first thing
that i shall hear of you will be
that you be in trouble
you will
be a victim of you own generous and
confide nature

why go roderick
i be happy here
as long as you be kind to i as
you now be
we can not appear in
london as we ought
the little money
you will get will be spent like all
the rest have be
let we stay here
and be content

humph
i believe she be at the
bottom of it the wicked schemer



we do not start in state you may
be sure
we do not let the country
know we be going or leave notice
of adieu with we neighbor
the
famous mr
james cosgrove and he
noble wife travele in a hack
chaise and pair



when a man be going to the devil
how easy and pleasant a journey it
be
the thought of the money quite
put i in a good humor and i wife
as she lay on i shoulder in the
postchaise going to london said
it be the happy ride she have
taken since we marriage



one night we stay at reading



i lady and i agreed that with the
money we would go to france and
wait there for good time and
that night over we supper form
a score of plan both for pleasure
and retrenchment
you would have
think it be darby and joan
together over they supper



woman
woman
when i recollect
lady Cosgroves smile and
blandishments how happy she seem
to be on that night
what an air of
innocent confidence appear in she
behavior and what affectionate
name she called i
i be lost in
wonder at the depth of she
hypocrisy
who can be surprise
that an unsuspecting person like
myself should have be a victim to
such a consummate deceiver



we be in london at three of the clock
an halfanhour before the time
appointed



i easily find out mr
Tapewells
apartment
a gloomy den it be and
in an unlucky hour i entered it

roderick do not go in
i be sure
there be danger
there be time yet
let we go back anywhere

lady cosgrove you be an old fool

old fool

oh fool as i be i have outwit
the most crafty and treacherous
monster under the sun
yes i be a
fool when i married you and give up
other and nobl heart for you

forget i name and lineage to unite
myself with a baseborn adventurer
a fool to bear without repine
the most monstrous tyranny that ever
woman suffer
to allow i property
to be squander
to see woman as
base and lowborn as yourself

blackguard could say or do

protection of she relation and the
law and need fear you infamous
persecution no longer

but you be not safe and as sure as
i be a man of honor i will have
you heart blood

take down he word constable
swear the peace against he

i would not sully i sword with the
blood of such a ruffian
if the
scoundrel remains in london another
day he will be seize as a common
swindler

where be the man who will seize i

let the scoundrel come

cowardly braggart come first if
you have the soul of a man

we be not going to seize you
i
dear sir we do not wish to seize
you
we will give you a handsome sum
to leave the country only leave she
ladyship in peace

and the country will be rid of such
a villain



i be no long the man i be at
twenty when i should have charged
the ruffian sword in hand and
send at least one of they to his
account
i be broken in spirit
regularly catch in the toil
utterly baffled and beaten by that
woman
be she relent at the
door when she pause and beg i
to turn back
have she not a
lingering love for i still
she
conduct show it as i come to
reflect on it
it be i only
chance now left in the world so i
put down i sword upon the lawyer
desk

gentleman i shall have no violence
you may tell mr
Tapewell i be quite
ready to speak with he when he be
at leisure



i be instruct to take a lodge
for the night in a coffee house near
grays inn and anxiously expected a
visit from mr
Tapewell

i have be authorized by lady
cosgrove and she advisor to pay you
an annuity of pound a year
specifically on the condition of you
remaining abroad out of the three
kingdom and to be stopped on the
instant of you return
i advise
you to accept it without delay for
you know as well as i do that you
stay in london will infallibly
plunge you in gaol as there be
innumerable writ taken out against
you here and in the west of england
and that you credit be so blown
upon that you could not hope to
raise a shilling
i will leave you
the night to consider this proposal
but if you refuse the family will
proceed against you in london and
have you arrested
if you accede a
quarter salary will be paid to you
at any foreign port you should
prefer

mr
Tapewell i do not require a
night to consider this proposal
what other choice have a poor lonely
and brokenhearted man
i shall
take the annuity and leave the
country


i be very glad to hear that you have
come to this decision mr
cosgrove
i think you be very wise

mr
james Cosgroves personal
narrative finish here for the
hand of death interrupted the
ingenious author soon after the
period which this memoir be
compiled after he have live
nineteen year an inmate of the
fleet prison where the prison
record state he die of delirium
tremens

he faithful old mother joined he
in he lonely exile and have a
bedroom in fleet market over the
way
she would come and stay the
whole day with he in prison
work

the countess be never out of love
with she husband and as long as
she live james enjoy he income
of pound per year and be
perhaps as happy in prison as at
any period of he existence

when she ladyship die she son
sternly cut off the annuity
devote the sum to charity
which he said would make a nobl
use of it than the scoundrel who have
enjoy it hitherto

when the famous character lost his
income he spirit entirely failed
he be remove into the pauper
ward where he be known to black
boot for wealthy prisoner and
where he be detect in stealing a
tobacco box

he mother attain a prodigious old
age and the inhabitant of the
place in she time can record with
accuracy the daily dispute which
used to take place between mother
and son until the latter from
habit of intoxication falling into
a state of almost imbecility be
tend by he tough old parent as a
baby almost and would cry if
deprive of he necessary glass of
brandy
it be in the reign of george
that the abovenamed personage
live and quarreled
good or bad
handsome or ugly rich or poor they
be all equal now
