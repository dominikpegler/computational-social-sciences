dr
gardner

i have ask dr
Lamott to consult
with we
this be not really i
turf
dr
Lamott teach the psycho
pathology of psychopathic behavior
at stanford and be also a member
of the justice department
psychological profile team
dr
Lamott


there be two possibility
one
the person who write this book be
you murderer and act out the
kill described in ritualistic
literal detail
two
someone who
want to do the person who write
this book harm read the book and
enact the kill described to
incriminate the writer

what if the writer do it
what
be we dealing with


you be dealing with a devious
diabolical mind
this book must
have be written at least six
month maybe year before it be
published
that mean the writer
planned the crime at least in the
subconscious back then
the fact
that the writer carry it out
indicate psychopathic obsessive
behavior in term not only of the
killing itself but in term of
apply advance defense mechanism

most time i can not tell shit from
shinola doc
what be all that
you just said

she anticipate the book to be she
good alibi


correct

she be going to say do you think
i would be dumb enough to kill anyone
in the exact way i have described in
i book
i would not do that because
i would know i would be a suspect

what if it be not the writer
what
if it be someone who read the book


you be dealing then with someone
so obsess that he or she be
will to kill an irrelevant and
innocent victim to place the blame
on the person who write this book
we be talking about deepseated
obsessional hatred
an utter lack
of sense of proportion or
perspective

we have get a topoftheline once
inalifetime loonytune either
way you cut it that be what you be
saying right doc


you be dealing with someone very
dangerous and very i will

come on you know there be no case
here
there be no physical evidence
okay she do not have an alibi
but there be no motive
she defense
would just beat we to death with
the copycat thing
anybody who
read the book could have do it

so what do we do nothing


we bring she in for questioning

she be get enough money to burn
this whole department down


she be the last person see with
the guy i will take the
responsibility

it be yours

it will not do any good
she will come
in with lee bailey and mel Belli
trail behind she on a solid
gold chain from Tiffanys

yes she will

no she will not

i do not think she be going to hide
behind anybody
i do not think
she be going to hide at all

i think you be as crazy as she
probably be curran

you know what they say
it take
one to know one

ms
Tramell we would like you to come
downtown and answer some question
for we

be you arrest i

if that be the way you want to play
it

can i change into something more
appropriate
it will just take a
minute

come in

how long will this take

i do not know

do you always keep old newspaper
around

only when they make interesting
read

i be ready

you have the right to an attorney

why would i need an attorney

do you have a cigarette

i said i liked johnny to use
he hand
i do not give any rule nick
i
go with the flow

boz ms
Tramell

i would have to be pretty stupid to
write a book about a kill and
then kill he the way i described
in i book
i would be announce myself
as the killer
i be not stupid

we know you be not stupid ms
