th



foreboding organ music be hear
we be looking down at a rough brick floor
be it an
alley

a cobblestone street

a warehouse
a factory
we be not sure
the flickering glow of flame be the only illumination
the ominous organ music continue as
from the bottom of the frame
dark pool of blood slowly begin to spread
moving up
the frame defy gravity
the flickering flame reflected
in the blood
finally the pool of blood fill the entire frame

shrill factory whistle blow
bloodchilling and spineshattering
the whistle be a bizarre combination of sound
a factory
whistle
a hog be slaughter
a dog snarl
a roar
inferno
a human scream
and a mane face appear upside down reflected in the pool
of blood
he be a slender dandy in pearl grey glove and
match waistcoat
cold and superior aristocrat
the camera slowly revolve the gentleman becoming right
side up as

attend the tale of sweeney todd
he skin be pale and he eye be odd
he shave the face of gentleman
who never thereafter be hear of again
he tread a path that few have tread
do sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
we cut from the blood to see the gentleman standing before
we
strangely impassive
we be in an eerie dark chamber unclear a low ceiling a
world of silhouette and shadow



another figure emerge from the miasma of shadow into the
hellish flickering of flame

he be large rotund
and sleek
impressive muttonchops

he keep a shop in london town
of fancy client and good renown
and what if none of they soul be saved
they go to they maker impeccably shave
more begin to emerge from the shadow joining the
gentleman and the banker as

by sweeney
by sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
although prosaic in appearance these figure be in fact


swing you razor wide sweeney
hold it to the sky
freely flow the blood of those
who moralize
as they continue the new figure become more distinct
a tough leatherskinned military man in a
crimson imperial uniform

he need be few he room be bare
a lean severe man with pale skin in clerical
attire

lavabo and a fancy chair
a small meek man with glass in an i willfitting
suit

mug of sud and a leather strop
an apron a towel a pail and a mop
a dash young man from oxford with luxurious
long hair




for neatness he deserve a nod
do sweeney todd

the demon barber of fleet street
the ghost be a bit more insinuate now as they move around
this mysterious world

inconspicuous sweeney be
quick and quiet and clean e be
back of he smile under he word
sweeney hear music that nobody hear
sweeney ponder and sweeney planned
like a perfect machine e planned
sweeney be smooth sweeney be subtle
sweeney would blink and rat would scuttle
the specters be becoming more insistent they strange
impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red
flame become an inferno

sweeney be smooth sweeney be subtle
sweeney would blink and rat would scuttle
inconspicuous sweeney be
quick and quiet and clean e be
like a perfect machine e be
be sweeney
sweeney
sweeney
Sweeeeeneeeeey
on this explosive note we revolve away from the ghostly
fury
to discover

standing before we
an unclear figure
silhouette in blaze red flame
we slowly push in on he as

attend the tale of sweeney todd
he serve a dark and a vengeful god
what happen then




well who be to say

and he would not want we to give it away

not sweeney
not sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
on this note we push in tight on the figure of todd
music and the clanging of a clock tower bell be hear as we
slowly begin pulling back and be imperceptibly transport
to


a young sailor of about be standing at the rail
of a ship
we see the obscure shape of rig and sail
behind he
the cry of sailor echo
behind he stand the and the
they be
looking past anthony looking at something
they move away as
anthony peer through the fog strain to see
london
gradually as the ship approach the tower spire and
mountainous rooftop of the city begin to stand out in
relief to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
toward it prey
music continue as anthony take in the dreadful and
magnificent spectacle of the th century metropolis
the
gnarl of rooftop
the labyrinth of street and alley
the
black trail of smoke reaching up like skeletal finger from
a thousand chimney
london
Sulfurous london
anthony be awestruck

i have sail the world beheld it wonder
from the dardanelles
to the mountain of peru
but there be no place like london
then



sweeney todd step to anthonys side grimly interrupt

no there be no place like london

mr
todd

you be young
life have be kind to you
you will learn
todds glare forward he haunt gaze never leaving the
approaching city


music continue as todd stand very still and take in the
shadowy figure on the dock
anthony seem almost lost at he side overwhelmed by the
scale and aura of the city

lord
take you breath away
do not it
todd shudder violently almost snarl

there be a hole in the world
like a great black pit
and the vermin of the world
inhabit it
and it moral be not worth
what a pig could spit
and it go by the name of london
at the top of the hole
sit the privilege few
making mock of the vermin
in the low zoo
turning beauty into filth and greed
i too
have sail the world and see it wonder
for the cruelty of man
be as wondrous as peru
but there be no place like london
anthony look at he friend mystify by he grim reaction
to the city




i beg you indulgence anthony
i
mind be far from easy
in these once
familiar street i feel shadow
everywhere

shadow

ghost
anthony looking at he questioning
todd continue quietly

there be a barber and he wife
and she be beautiful
foolish barber and he wife
she be he reason and he life
and she be beautiful
and she be virtuous
and he be
naive
anthony watch rapt as todd remember


fifteen year before
todd walk with he beautiful wife through a crowd
flower market a colorful explosion of blossom
lucy carry
they oneyearold baby
todd be almost unrecognizable to we content and smile
chat with he wife
happy



there be another man who see
that she be beautiful
pious vulture of the law
who with a gesture of he claw
remove the barber from he plate
then there be nothing but to wait
and she would fall
so soft
so young
so lost
and oh so beautiful



during the above an elderly man with a
saturnine demeanor eye lucy through the luxurious bunch
of flower
he stalk she desire she
with the judge be he nefarious creature
the
beadle be a large man he florid nature and pink powder
face never quite disguise he lethality
the judge whisper to the beadle indicate todd
then the
beadle and several policeman sweep in and drag todd off
the
judge move in on lucy like a predator
and we return to


music continue

and the lady sir
do she succumb

oh that be many year ago
i doubt if anyone would know
quiet beat

i owe you i life anthony

the ocean still

fleet street

until then i friend
he offer he hand
todd take it and shake
then todd quickly turn and go
anthony stand for a moment saddened by the mysterious pall
that hang over he friend



todd stride along deep in thought
the emotion roiling
within he finally seethe out in a dark mutter

there be a hole in the world
like a great black pit
and it be filled with people
who be filled with shit
and the vermin of the world
inhabit it
he disappear down the street as the music


we ahead of todd cutting through the city at
lightning pace down twist alley and up crowd boulevard
into tunnel and over bridge slash through london
at breakneck speed the insane explosion of music sending
we hurtling to


fleet street
we see the exterior of mrs
Lovetts pie shop
it be tatty
and unloved by all
yet it have a strange ghostly presence to
it
imposing and dead at the same time
there be an exterior staircase leading up to a darken
second floor room with a window overlook the street
the music slow and continue as we see todd standing in
front of the shop consider it deeply
the we see before pass glance at todd
here and

and a pussy good for maybe six or
seven at the most
and i be sure they can not compare
as far as taste

mrs

eminently practical and yet
appropriate as always
mrs
lovett how i have live without you
all these year i will never know
how delectable
also undetectable
how choice
how rare


well it do seem a
waste
it be an idea

oven




what be that


it be priest
have a little priest

not as bland as curate either


lawyer rather nice

if it be for a price





order something else though to follow
since no one should swallow
it twice

anything that be lean

air
then she slowly bolt the door



cacophony of madness

slam together in a series of cramp cell the low
ceiling pressing down
we discover anthony dressed as a fashionable wigmaker
walking past the cell with the odious

fogg carry

from across the street we see todd leading the beadle up the
stairs to the barber shop chatting with he easily
we realize we be seeing the perspective of the beggar woman
hunched across the street watch they closely


toby be eating a pie as he slowly wander around the
bakehouse
he stop to consider the many stain cleaver and bone saw
curious
then he bite on something hard stop he reach into
he mouth and pull something out
look at it
it be a fingernail
to be exact it be the severed tip of a finger
toby drop it in horror and start back
suddenly a loud and make he spin
alarm



as
the bloody body of the beadle from the
mouth of the chute
toby scream and race to the door
pull at it
lock
no use
he bang on the heavy iron door
wildly








the thunder roar from the bake oven seem to rise to match
he frenzy as
in panic toby race to the sewer grate yank it up and
disappear down into the sewer as the shrill factory whistle
and we cut to


todd stand by the chair he razor high
he eye blaze
he face covered in a spray of blood
lose in rapture
not for long
the gentleman the banker the general move into the frame
with purpose impatient
the gentleman flick out he handkerchief and begin to clean
the blood off todds face he be not gentle the blood
smear

the engine roar the motor hiss
and who could see how the road would twist
meanwhile the banker pull off todds stain barber tunic
and hand todd he jacket

in Sweeneys ledger the entry matched
beadle arrive and a beadle dispatch
meanwhile the general be cleaning up the blood on the barber
chair




to satisfy the hungry god
of sweeney todd

the demon barber of fleet
a sharp cry from across the room todd spin

the history of the world i pet

by the sea mr

where there be no one nosy
he waltze she toward the roar oven
she offer no resistance fully aware of what be coming
the blaze thunder inferno of the oven make it seem
they be the damn dance through hell

and life be for the alive i dear
so let we keep living it

just keep living it
really living it
the music reach a thunder crescendo as
he fling she into the oven and slam the door
we hear she scream
and banging on the oven door
todd sink to he knee and cover he ear desperately as
the bang and scream and music finally fade to silence
then he slowly drag himself across the floor to the beggar
woman
he cradle she head in he arm




there be a barber and he wife
and she be beautiful
foolish barber and he wife
she be he reason and he life
and she be beautiful
and she be virtuous
and he be
todd fold himself over he dead wife
the only sound he deep anguished sob
long beat
then he become aware of something
he look over to see
toby stare at he from the open sewer grate
he have see
everything
todd watch as toby silently pull himself up
todd gently
set lucy down and then still kneel turn to face toby
long beat as they look at each other
then toby slowly move and carefully pick up todds razor
todd look at he
then slowly unbuttons he collar and expose he neck
he bend he head back offering he naked throat
toby slowly go to he and methodically slit he throat
todd continue to gaze up at toby as we hear the lonely sound
of wind escaping from he severed wind pipe
then toby turn and leaf the bakehouse
todd lean forward die
we cut to he pointofview
the rough brick floor
from the bottom of the frame
dark pool of blood slowly begin to spread
moving up
the frame
the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in
the blood



finally the pool of blood fill the entire frame
we realize this be the first image we see in the story
todds perspective
todds blood
as he die
as before the Gentlemans face appear reflected in the
pool of blood

attend the tale of sweeney todd
he skin be pale and he eye be odd
the banker emerge from the shadow of the bakehouse

he shave the face of gentleman
who never thereafter be hear of again
the general emerge
and the tourist
and the priest
and the student

he tread a path that few have tread
do sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
then a new ghost
a face we recognize
the beggar
woman

he keep a shop in london town
of fancy client and good renown
she be joined by the judge

and what if none of they soul be saved
they go to they maker impeccably shave

by sweeney
by sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
the beadle and pirelli join the ghost

swing you razor wide sweeney
hold it to the sky
freely flow the blood of those
who moralize



the ghost move around the bakehouse considering the meat
grinder and stain cleaver and chopping block

he need be few he room be bare
he hardly use he fancy chair
the more he bleed the more he life
he never forget and he never forgive
perhaps today you give a nod
to sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
hunting like predator we begin to move urgently through the
ghost
they long shadow tower bizarrely against the wall
and ceiling of the bakehouse
the fiery red roar of the bake
oven build in intensity

sweeney wish the world away
Sweeneys weeping for yesterday
hug the blade waiting the year
hearing the music that nobody hear
sweeney wait in the parlor hall
sweeney lean on the office wall
no one can help nothing can hide you
be not that sweeney there beside you
sweeney wish the world away
Sweeneys weeping for yesterday
be sweeney
there he be it be sweeney
sweeney
sweeney
we tear through they with increase frenzy cut
quickly vertiginous angle as the music build

there
there
there
there
there
there
there
there
they move away
revealing
todd and mrs
lovett
facing each other
we circle they




attend the tale of sweeney todd
he serve a dark and a hungry god

sharply to mrs
lovett
to seek revenge may lead to hell


but everyone do it if seldom as well


as sweeney

as sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet
the ghost begin to disappear
fade into the shadow of
the bakehouse
leaving todd and mrs
lovett alone

street
the febrile music continue as todd and mrs
lovett stand
alone continue to glare at each other
finally she give he a grim little smile and disappear into
the darkness
he stand alone
and we cut to
series of image from early in we story cut to the music
todds life flashing before he eye
the image building as the music race toward it conclusion
todd sing slash smile striding
the final crash of music at the final image
todd kneel hunched over the pool of blood on the
bakehouse floor
he fall
into the blood
dead



snap to black
the end
