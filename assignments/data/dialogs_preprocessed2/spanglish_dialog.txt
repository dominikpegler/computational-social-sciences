shape fill the low portion of the screen
it be a mane
back
a perfect back
good dark color slim muscular

a song
if you understood the word
you would hear love confront and considered in a very
specific way
we be in a mexico city suburb
the day be
hot
small bead of sweat be see on the mane back the
first indication that we be in slow motion
perfect red
fingernail come into view
and now a woman hand go
beautifully to work
part sensual back scratch part
massage
the hand cup bit of the mane back a strong thumb
probe he spine a long finger tease the very top of his
ass in a cute fingerpirouette and then continue down
and as the hand rise once more to the top of he back for
another trip down he upper body

full title minute after minute of title
with some key dissolve helping we to represent some
minute of time passage as the hand continue to scratch and
rub the man making sound of pleasure
the hand be get
tire
flirtatious no more this be get to be work
the
unseen woman shake the hand vigorously the man say a
single sound urging she to continue the exhaust hand
comply then stop then the unseen woman change hand as

the new hand wearing a wedding ring
go to work then it too stop to rest
the man say
something in spanish
important for we because it will
establish that there will be no subtitle and yet we
understand perfectly that he be asking she to continue
she
reply in spanish lightheartedly with a small and pretty
laugh that she hand be tire
we understand
the man tell
she to continue
she continue the rub now desultory and
resentful
she stop for another rest
the man want more and
grab forcibly at she hand he own hand coming into view
for the first time
she say in spanish with no particular
anger you said you would never push i around again
if you
do i will somehow break you arm so you can rub you own
back as high as you want

all spanish dialogue will
be work hard to provide something extra for the spanish
speaking
working in tidbit or extra exposition joke etc

for now the mane tone change placate she to continue
even as she resume the massage they begin to have a domestic
argument in spanish
this be no long a massage we envy
this back rub going as it do from sex and hope to discord
and alienation will be we only full direct knowledge of
they marriage



show we the room and beyond through the window a school
bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road
we now see the full figure of the woman back as she look
up with excitement and stop rub with the word

cristina
when the man protest she stop she indicate
they should both run and meet they daughter
he wave she
off
stun by he disinterest she run from the room


as six year old and adorable wait patiently to
step down
she see she mother and grin and wave excitedly
digging into she little pack to pull out an english book
which she display with pride
now she step down from the
bus and as she walk narration begin
the
voice be of a girl eleven year old than the child we see

to princeton Universitys director
of admission
in consider i

for and have every reason to
expect an essay from i about

and while i love dance this
dance of self be one i be afraid to

young girl look off and
light up
i prefer to write about i mother



dropdead gorgeous latin woman in she early s
as mother
and daughter move inside a car pull up with an ominous man
get out
he nod in another direction calling we
attention to a police car park off the street

the woman make a big fuss over the text book the
child have
this be one supportive mom
again she be
disbelieve that she husband show no interest especially
when the child seem briefly hurt
the woman husband look
from the window and see the ominous man coming
the woman
now do everything humanly possible to distract the child so
she do not see what be transpiring

for i mother that afternoon
eleven year ago be a watershed
not because of i father


imprisonment but because it be i
first day at school


this room be directly across from the husband room
the
woman look up to see she husband open the suitcase to show
the man a huge store of mont blanc pen and highend watch
the man give she husband some money
all the time the woman
be chattering to distract the girl
look off the woman
grow wideeyed as she see she husband count some money
the
undercover cop begin shouting order
the woman raise she
voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzle
she daughter

there be never any pretense that
the gorgeous vital clever
temperamental animal that be i
mother ever for a heartbeat
consider have any life of she
own
she ignore all she need and
be alive only for i
it be
terrific
at the time

as she watch she daughter chew a cookie
she daughter
begin to tell about she day she young mother taking on a
glow we have not yet see
and all the while she eye the
action in the next room
she husband make a break for the
window
the other man point a gun at the ceiling preparing
to fire a warn shot
the woman move ever so quickly to a
shelf of she favorite dish all the while talking to she
daughter making much over the kid new school book
it be
an impressive charade

and just as the cop shoot at the ceiling in perfect time
she upset the dish the result noise covering the
shot
the woman ask she daughter what she learned
today
the daughter say she be taught a little english
mother be impress as she watch the cop move she husband
toward the front door where other police await
she daughter
start to follow she gaze and she distract she
brandishing
the SpanishEnglish book and asking she to say something




standing proudly smooth she skirt


as she clear she throat and say directly into camera

though outside she life mate be be loaded into the
back of a police car

but the
police turn on they siren and the girl turn to see she
father as the car pull away
the child be stricken
tear
start to form in she eye
she mother act quickly
we be
about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
will
the mother lean down give three quick kiss power
peck to the girl cheek and then an admonition in

you be not good enough to feel
disappoint that you just missed

improve
and you still get enough
respect so that you can get good
people to work with you

the pad in effect lend subtitle to Flors word
cristina
wince with the word she record even while punctuate
perfectly

smug
john get up and take a conciliatory step toward flor so
that now cristina be in the middle looking up at they as she

i be not sure i can explain to you
the concept of not do well in a
class
in this case math
and the
system kind of insist on the
illusion that you have learned math
so they make you go to summer
school
it help they avoid facing
that they have failed in they
mission

deborah privy to the conversation now

that you be good at everything

where i might have i nose in
front
deborah can not think of what single thing bernice could
possibly feel superior about
she be genuinely puzzle

and that thing be
bernice deeply resent the question
she turn to she mother

sexual experience
cristina laugh

that one even she know be funny
cristina give bernice an appreciative push from behind
deborah for some reason feel she deserve credit for they
connection

deborah flor and cristina engaged in a
momentous conversation

throughout the follow and

it be great to hear someone else say
that out loud
hard to explain

i get it

a beat
then deeply with
core feeling a lament
ah man

it will be okay

no i be think about you

you ah man be for i
you
think i be in trouble with
cristina

it be just tough to be sane


to know you be not just making
something out of nothing
that when
you think you be at some
crossroads you be

i never know a man who can put
himself in i place like you do
how do you become that man

i do not know
you introduce two
jew in the desert and wait five
thousand year
then bingo
somebody else who can see trouble
coming but can not do anything about
it

i do not understand

that be okay

i want to

nothing
i do not know what i be
talking about
sustain gust of wind which celebrate she shape in a way
which cannot be ignore

will you sit down
get out of the
damn wind
she sit
it help

so you going to send she

i do not know
but it do not feel
good
i think if she go there it
will be one of two thing
either
she will be odd
or she will make
herself the same as they

that be the way i feel
about bernice going there
exactly


i be not able to think it that
clearly
but that be how i feel
so
between odd and the same
you
get to root for odd do not you

yes you get to
camera begin to pull back
early in the move johns word
stop the movement

this be a crummy summer
flor nod ruefully
then suddenly off a glance at he

not all crummy
suddenly there be a bit of danger
she rise quickly
changing mode

as the
ending the
summer at the rent house
as we transition to



through the unusual center window we see flor and cristina
flor at this moment be assimilate against every fiber in
she body
cristina be excited certain she life be taking an
incandescent turn
quite a contrast


as the bus stop
bernice be across the street along with
some other kid and deborah who be wearing she run
clothes
flor and cristina exit the bus


you just make it
i be get
worry

Flors uncertain reaction be taken as a yes

what do we get she
deborah hand cristina a locket
then note Flors
expression

it be from of we
you mother
too

it be not from i

deborah do a goodnatured accepting Flors reaction
as if it where an eccentricity
as cristina and bernice board
the bus cristina generally say goodbye to both woman
thereby deprive flor of she own moment of passage with she
daughter

have a great year girl
this be so great
it fill you
heart do not it
deborah turn and see flor have already start doggedly up
the hill



walk up the hill blinking in disbelief at she own
fury
deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned
flor
keep walking toward the camera

there be a terrible crisis which
come when you own personality be
not equal to the challenge you
face
when be who you be no
longer works
deborah have start to jog
as she approach flor she call
for a clear path well in advance

left
left
flor do not alter course though she do start to walk
fast

left
left
deborah be close behind now


suddenly flor break into a run
she be lithe and quick

blink of confusion
then something resemble innate
satisfaction as she quicken she gait and
the race be on

strangely she be interpreting this as closeness
she be
genuinely warm


why be i not surprise you be
competitive
deborah look up the street at a delivery truck

oh they be deliver i table
flor stay on task

she be concern
as she go after the rabbit

show the delivery truck as finish line in the distance

flor fuel by desperation
deborah relentlessly gain
exhilarated

decidedly anticlimactic
deborah draw even pass she
arrive at the house with a large margin of victory

i love you for trying


she exit into she home

bent over hand on knee sweaty gasping for breath
flor
finally straighten up and there be no other course
continue she walk up the hill to work

when people exist under one roof a
tiny society form
the stuff of


novelas
master and servant
unconsciously dancing in lock step
so that when thing go wrong
trauma converge



as john move past evelyn on he way to work
she look at

strain a bit for breath

if you do not act

awful fate for yourself

dumb
that be it
drive safely
she grab a deep breath and then turn and walk to the
house


if we be out of coffee it be over
for i
suddenly a sharp horn be hear
evelyn jump
then turn to
see she daughter calling to she from the driver seat of the

flor walking from the begin of the hill
she look
off to see johns vehicle approaching
she brighten

who do not see she

as he drive past she



as john enter

as he turn
at the top of the stairs




denouement



john enter the room on the double
pass deborah without
knowing it
she be partially obscure by the drape or some
such
as he pass
camera
she be a
mess
goopy tear stain
seeing he and he concern bring
she grief to a high ground
a sinner humbled by
goodness
a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability

deb
deb
where be you
he be about to leave the room
she be about to let he but
an instinct lead she astray once more

here i be

baby what

baby
stay there john
sit
down
i suddenly get what i have to
do
i just have to get the guts

be it absolutely necessary to make
it this
this scary
can you just
say it

not so easy

tenderready for the big
heal
yeah
come on
it be i
we can
talk

do i ever hope so
i have be
seeing another man for the last
eleven week and it be nothing and
i end it tonight
at first it be
just keeping an eye on the real
estate market
then it be
what
i be insecure and looking for
some ridiculous vali


shock victim
he hold up a hand to stop she

go hold on
hold on
i be
missing what you be saying
you
can not just keep talking and expect
i to follow it when you start the
way you do

just what do you hear

well there be the crack in the
planet
that be noisy
she look at he
a solid beat

there be an actual noise in i
head
no kid
briefly he do the noise

i meet he about
john hold up a hand to stop she
he need to gather himself
to hear this
she wait
and wait
as he wait he grow
flushed and stun with dread
finally a word

you
she take that as a cue to start

i meet he
he put up he hand

if you talk that fast
i will never
hear you
there be a lot going
through i mind
have you say
yet whether you sleep with he

so far i have just be talking about
a flirtation because the really
important thing for you to know

have you say yet whether you have
have sex with someone else
because
i really be missing most of you
word
so help i out here


i have be trying to explain that
for the first ten week there be
almost nothing to

sincerely checking but
wild
you still have not say right

be this you way of

this be i way of
this be i way
of asking you whether
he stop
staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future

oh man once i ask it
give i a
second
several beat then some
conversational good
manner for keeping she
waiting
i be just trying to figure out
whether there be any way to avoid
knowing
no damn
quickly closing this
argument with himself
there be not
okay you be on
real short answer
huh
have you have sex with
another

i know you be very angry

consideringthen
repress answer
ahhhh
i be get there yes

john
i think if you let i tell you the
full everything of this we would be in
a position to deal with it
well
because eleven week ago
when


you do not believe that i miss you
word
i get three or four
top
and then just see you mouth
moving with nothing coming out and
then i spin out and there be this
noise
but there be no way to miss
a yes or no


yes

core simpleeight year
old
really

i make up i mind that i would
answer every question you have
i will
answer anything and everything and
more

what other question could there
be

be you really that much nice than
i

well you do not set the bar real
high
he get up and start to exit

no
please please please
i
think if you listen to exactly what
happen and then do whatever you
need to
we will
just let i tell
you everything
the doorbell ring
it be quite late
deborah wonder
what be up
she look out the window

oh it be just flor



as flor enter the Clasky house



flor see evelyn in the live room

what be you do here

i want cristina
i want to talk to
mrs
Clasky
i want to quit

i do not think you can do any of it
right this minute

oh yes
where be cristina


deborah can barely look at he

then when i be driving back
tonight after i end the whole
yuck thing
i be feeling human
i be do with what be he name
a
relief

and now it can be like
it never happen and then i
think that the only hope be that
i own that it do happen and that i
take i medicine here
because if
i be walking around with what i do
and you do not know what i
do
there be a real limit to how
close we can be
you be with i and
i be this person who have this bad
secret and we be not really on the
same page ever again
so the reason
i take this chance in telling be
because i want we to be good
i
want we to be close
i want to
feel like you be not nuts to be in
love with i
so what i think be we
should talk till we pass out
talk till we be so sick of each
other that there be nothing left to
do but take the first step out of
hell
so please let we not leave
this room until you have hear and
said everything
please say okay
she await he answer
he have hear barely a few word

what


john

i have get to get out of
here

as she start to follow
he
stay put
she do
just before he exit

you have get to say something

you be a terrible wife
he exit



evelyn stand in the doorway with flor
they be looking at
cristina and she two friend sleeping together

i do not think you want to wake she
when you be this upset and the
other kid be right there and
flor make a noise of frustration and retreat from the room

nonetheless grab she arm and guide she up and in
she
catch and appreciate he automatic gracious manner while

Deborahs face be bleached from crying
the tear duct of
she now brown eye be parch dry
evelyn sit eye she as
she look through the window at the predawn emptiness of
stone canyon
in she current shape she would give pause to a
staff worker at promise
a shock victim walking through the
rubble after the bomb have drop
Deborahs voice be
scratchy when she speak

tell i again why i can not call he
on the cell

besides that he turned it off

forty message start to look needy

deborah nod in agreement then look at she mother in a
somewhat new way
as if evelyn be an actual person instead
of an upset extension of herself

there be one thing i would like to say
to you about you and i

promiscuous woman during i

you own bad enemy

but i have get to know whether he
touched she where he touched she
how he touched she if they broke
a sweat what they said who
make the first move how they left
it if anyone love anyone or have
an intention of making contact in
the future what she wear how he
feel afterwards whether anyone
mention i
whether they held hand when they
left
the distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs


just those word i said
if you
want a prayer of coming out of
this

i know you be right
but

but what

i forget the sentence you said i
should say

she take a breath exit


she pause at the top of the stairs
a breath
then unable to
help herself run down they at breakneck speed



john turning a light on when deborah burst into the room

panicked she grab at she life preserver

Deborahs suddenly classy demeanor provide just the bare
of footing for they
he look at she directly for the first
time since she told he

she nod
then go back up the stairs


evelyn who have be standing close to the doorway stand
clear to let she enter
as deborah fly in wildly vulnerable
she breath race

i be literally choking on unsay
word
seriously
if this be a
restaurant ten people would have
they knuckle in i sternum


the fact that you do not just make
thing badly should fill you with
hope
in she current state she have to process that one
and do
she breath slow



the first time we have see this room since flor be working

despite herself bernice start to cry
moan to herself over
the display
now in the background we hear a subliminal
human voice
incrementally it will grow loud and be
recognizable as deborah calling flor from the master bedroom
window
bit by bit the other will become aware of this as
flor ignore it
bernice go to embrace cristina

hear the begin of they exchange

flor enter the house



she stand waiting
walk to the hallway and crane she head
to see into room wonder if john be there
finally as
she pass the stairwell she see cristina on an upper
land and say in spanish that cristina should get she
thing and meet she out front
cristina agitated move off
to comply
then deborah appear in the same spot

a minute
flor nod and start up the stairs


deborah hold open the door while flor walk inside
then
close it

what be with avoiding i be i this

in a bad way

you know something i think we be
saying the same thing
look as
long as we be do closure
what
do you and i husband john do

flor pause for less of a beat than we would have imagined

i can only tell you what i do


that will be sufficient

these be tender
feeling
i become sure of what an incredibly
lucky woman you be and i must make
myself not envy you which be hard
no it be not hard
it be impossible
now please
i be exhaust

same here believe i
deborah would hug
but it be only an eighth of a gesture
because flor have turn to exit calling for she daughter to
hurry as she go

cristina apurate


as she exit the house and move to the gate where she
punch in the exit code

as it swing open to reveal john



as she move alongside he and the gate close behind she

i be hanging out here waiting

flor shake she head no
she look away for a beat so the
next thing she do be a consider action
she lean forward
and kiss he on the lip
john look at she

this be killer
incredibly hard

yes cari
the gate open and a sniffling cristina be holding an armful
of loot

let she have it
party favor

she nod
bite back some emotion and turn from he

cristina

goodbye mr
Clasky
i be very
sorry we will not see each other as
frequently
she offer she hand which john shake while patting she on
the back

yes
they turn and begin walking down the street

the woman walking toward camera john briefly in the
background
as they begin they walk flor begin talking in
spanish

the first minute we be alone i
mother told i that i would no
longer go to the private school

no
no
you can not
i will not be able
to forgive you
it will be the end
i will not let you
and then cristina move she hysteric to spanish as she stop
walk and she mother take she hand and pull she along
with enormous dedication

cristina dropping present
picking they up
one of they left
by the wayside
people notice
Cristinas conduct violate
tacit zoning law

so we can see they face in the struggle



as they wait
flor talk sharply to cristina to control
herself

i mother changed we live once
more
this time because she see in
i to she great alarm a character
flaw of some size
she have taught
i to be a watch dog of i
character to control i ambition
i be not quite there

one last yelp from cristina as the bus arrive



almost empty it be saturday
mother and daughter sit
together by the giant window in the center of the bus
cristina eye she mother who be bearing she own heartbreak
with stoic dignity
the girl be becoming less inconsolable
and more in need of mothering

for that reason should you choose
to grant i you scholarship i
mother at i request will be
relocate to the new york
metropolitan area so that she can
stay close during i time at
princeton
cristina move closer to flor who sense it immediately and
wrap she in she arm
kiss she head

i hope i essay have do she
justice
i love she with all i
heart
