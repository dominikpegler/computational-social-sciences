which way do he go


rabbit warren of computer programmer in crisis mode
head shoot up from a cubicle
it be rush Nortebi
computer security expert
real world version of the
program
he cubicle be jammed with rack of vintage and
bleedingedge computer gear

i said
dozens of programmer work feverishly to track the system
intruder
Everybodys stump
dangle from desk lamp
the company toy
conical pyramid with a square stick on top
labeled




come on guy
nobody hack XNet
you going to let he get away

rush i think i find he
in the adjacent cubicle
overweight ultranerd
real world version of cyberworld Krod

check the old game grid
rush jockey an old apple computer
on screen
a crude
old vector graphics game grid
step appear the grid

you get a cookie mile
programmer gather to watch rush in action


vast lowrez uncool largely forgotten
pull a from he legging grip it

there he go
the chase be on
escape across the vast gridplane head down eye
hollow
he gain speed retreating to somewhere
surge on he pulse rider closing the gap


rush get the hang of this old game

i have not play this since i be
but i be mighty awesome



score an on this leech

negative
he be nobody

rush you have get to nail he

or you know we be all fired

whoa rush
i groked a pattern in
he move
fake left go right





you get he on the run dude

crash he
rush






Yikes




he crashed i


bad thing
flame war

mile
do you get a trace on he

we be so screw

who tell the boss

get the system back up
now
move





weather be holding
dress rehearsal
on for
in the morning we let
the press in for a tech setup
then you go live worldwide sharp

delay the press until

i will
taking the stage at

force a
network breakin
then it be news

play that again

XNet deploy radical software design
construct proprietary whitehot
firewall unleash virus killer
app
create the most secure data
network in history
you data can
never again be hack corrupt
stolen or destroyed
XNet be the
final solution totally guaranteed

secure data transmission

who changed that
who put


um that would be
legal

change it back to the way i write
it
with the launch of XNet this
company guarantee one hundred percent
secure data transmission
if we
can not deliver on that promise we
deserve to be out of business

what can not wait rush




um
XNet be just breached by a
hacker

system back up no permanent damage
but
but whoever behind this
they be good and they be still out
there



identify the intruder







identity not capture




how do he enter XNet

how could you let this happen



i do what you programme i to do
i be construct XNet



new instruction find and destroy
the intruder

no
we can not delay the open of
net
disregard i last command
maintain construction priority







system be stable again keep you
finger crossed

any luck finding the intruder

do not ask

what be she do here
this be an
operation meet

you and meg still eh
at it

there be never anything between we

she be advance project
this have
nothing to do with she

this company existence depend on
the flawless launch of XNet in twenty
two hour fiftyone minute
now
somebody some hacker some
competitor somebody just prove
they be smart than we
break
into XNet be theoretically
impossible

this creep the good i have ever see
he cross platform crack bit
encryption cloak every move never
leaf a trace

when you find he i will be sure to
hire he




boy and girl we cannot sell a
secure network that be not secure

we delay the launch

and the world assume we have get a
faulty product
and they would be right

we ramp up we encryption scheme

thicken all firewall

we can not win playing defense
and
it be a big job than just swat
an intruder program
somewhere
there be a human mind behind this
thing
we have to get to that user
and shut he or she down or the
game never end

what do you need rush

guy for day

we do not have hour
this problem
need to be go before tomorrow

come on people this company
future be at stake
it be time to
think without a box

at a time like this let we seek
inspiration in the past
we should
ask ourselves
what solution would
spring from the inspired mind of we
depart leader flynn




be the be operational

um
midway into phase one test

if we can not fight this intruder from
the outside then maybe we need to
fight he from the inside

i be ready to do i part

this company need a hero
who among
you be the smart most resourceful
and courageous

who else could it be





somebody going to tell i what i have
be volunteer for



rush you be the only one i can trust
to eliminate the intruder
but you
will not be do it the way you think
meg be working on something down
here that be well
beyond top
secret



this be where flynn worked
and
where he die

meg have reconstruct Flynns last
project
this time it work

you do not pick this up at circuit
city
what be it

quantum digitizer
prototype
only one of it kind
flynn design
it to break down physical object
into high resolution data
luckily
we salvage he key component and
backengineered the system

that be
not possible



flynn be trying to take it one step
**further/far
he wanted to transport a
human being into cyberspace

you mean the urban legend

computer suck flynn into cyberspace
a long time ago

we think it happen

it be a fluke
but flynn worked
for year down here trying to make
it happen again
one day a test
go bad
plasma reaction destroyed
this lab
flynn be reduced to ash

i be never tell how he die
it
be all just weird you know because
Flynns the guy who hired i
but
he be strange keep to himself i
do not know what job i be suppose
to be do
then you come onboard the company
wake up we have a direction
it be
kind of pathetic because by the
time flynn die everybody be too
busy to care

he be brilliant in he way but
genius without discipline lead to
nothing
he reckless habit nearly
ruined this company
and for sure
get he killed

that kind of accident can not happen
again
we have upgraded the system in
way flynn never could
the chip
do not exist until now




hey jojo
have good trip

you want she to send i into
cyberspace to catch that jerk who
hack we

the future of this company depend
on it

you can bring i back okay

ask jojo

destroy the intruder by tomorrow
rush
i know if anyone can it be
you
i have have i eye on you for a
long time
score this hit and i will
make you i full partner in this
company

i will not let you down
let we do it

i promise i will get you back safely
by tomorrow
but you have to
promise i something too




you be a piece of work
you dump
i because you said i be too much
about the company need and not
enough about yours
well here we
be the company need they good
guy and you just can not admit how
much to hurt to nominate i

this big than we rush
listen
to i
i do not know what you be
going to find in there but whatever
it be promise you will follow you
heart and do the right thing

oh
so you think i have a heart

i promise

it be overload

what be happening

system be losing stability




there be be another breech

it be the intruder again

we have to abort

we might not get another chance










it be
the intruder

you be









but
you crashed irrecoverably

uh well i be not exactly

have be reboot

reboot be not authorized

yow
i know who programme you

i be mega XNet intelligence

mega
cool
i be

spy
pose as
under which
register be you reboot

i be a user

detain this impostor

no wait look
we be on the same
side here
i get an on the
intruder

tron

how do he get that




Plexor must know of this





Plexor
this be the one

you be not

i name be rush
i be a look i
get an on the intruder
do you
know the program they used to call
tron

you be in error
zero match

exactly
that be how he be get
past you
you do not see he for
what he be
he be one of you own
go bad
tron be a crude security
program from Encoms old day
strictly lowrez right
archived
and forgotten
but he source code
contain all the architecture of
every Encom system including Xnet



that be why some smart user dust
he off and upgrade he

user

people
like i
from the outside
people who write all of you
instruction

he display random instability

user do not exist

how do we contact sinclair
he will
explain

define sinclair

you do not know
oh geez
there
must be a way to link he into this

zero match for a sinclair

he be you boss
Everybodys boss
outside in the real world

assume the existence of a world
beyond this be a fatal error

Plexor issue all command

grep grep




okay
sorry
i be a program guess
i get a piece of i code corrupted
whatever it be it be given i power
over tron
they see i read he circuit
can
any other program do that

he create alternative data channel
at will

chaos

yeah i be a little unstable
but i
can find tron for you

release he

interface with this one
exploit
he ability
locate the program
tron and destroy he on sight

instruction received Plexor






i need to find a program called
he be a specialist in pattern
recognition
he snag the last
known position on tron for i

this be a waste of XNet resource
you be strictly random
we will
never find the intruder this way

Plexor ordered we to work together
you can not doubt he instruction
right

of course not
but i be programme
to predict all possible error
you
contain an infinite quantity

meg for sure programme you

i have no data on meg

never mind
i be be random

XNet be amazing
it be going to
change everything
unless one rogue
program called tron bring it down
do you believe he could

i calculate the probability
he could crash it all

so we be working together on this



as instruct i will interface



the program be over there

what a dump

hey
interface



three more hub city have be
attack by virus
but XNet open soon
you will travel
in total security

this be the one you seek



it be get to be

Krod

Krod

yeah yeah Heeey

the good pattern recognition program
ever
this guy can filter a river of junk
data and pull out the good stuff

you know it dude

who be this guy

mile i mean Krod you fly the
search engine
you run a trace on a
hotshot lightcycle rider
the red
guy
remember

well
eh
i would like to help you
but truth be i just get reboot
from a big crash
there be nothing
left in i memory from before

this will yield zero

hang on




remember Krod
you be watch
this lightcycle duel a red guy and
a green guy headtohead

the green guy fake out the red guy
but the red guy doublefaked the
green guy

okay

and the green guy
splatter big time
it be awesome
how could i forget that

where do the red guy go after that
you do not crash right away

he escaped out this hide exit


the

do you jack he coordinate

tr


and the green guy be
you get
reboot
they called you um
do not tell i i get it eh

call i rush




yeah
whatever
you be good
how do
you do that thing with you hand

it be complicate
you be coming
with we to the old game grid
we be
going to find tron and shut he down

beat work

hey babe
do i ever know you



the old game grid be this way

how do i uplink to the real world

the real world do not exist
nobody
can uplink
these port be for
simulation only

right
but how do those poor
misguided fool boot up the link

they stand in the center
hold they
disk above they head





intruder attempted another breakin
we patched the firewall but we
manpower get be maxed out

stay on it
nobody sleep

there be a message on you secure
link

where be this coming from

it be

i god he be there

rush it be sinclair and meg



i identify the intruder





tron
be not tron one of we
program





i have a plan to crash tron





rush

he would well not fail




hey
double point if you nail i
bring it on

stop
end you routine

cease
desist
we be on the same
team

i be XNet too

no hey hey big guy do not take it
so hard
we all have bad day



he be carrying out he program
all port be scheduled for de
rezz

easy big guy
no harm no foul

DRezz we can use a guy with you
raw power
you ready to be a hero
for XNet

cool
now i have get somebody i can
boss around

or not

let we get to the game grid

you have a skill for manipulating
other program

when do i get a shot at hacking you
code

never
we operate system be
incompatible

you act like i have get a virus




there it be

the place we nail tron



Drezz
cut a path

that be good
keep do it

violation
go away
access deny

relax buddy

pound he to bit Drezz



he be wireless

freaky

search data bank
IBeem
security specialist damaged in
service rated unstable

unstable
like they be not
they boot i off XNet
i will show
they
i be do i subroutine out
here
nobody get through this
portal

Drezz take out this blip

hang on
IBeem
we be from XNet

you be do a great job out
here
everybody know it

they do

that be right
now have you see a
rogue program around here
he be
red
super fast
know as tron




the red one
that illegal function
he blast through here and

i tell he access
deny he like i
be never there

when do he come through last

right before you get here

Ibeem we have get a plan to shut
down that red violator
you be going
to help we

let i at he

first you have get to let we onto the
game grid



this region be obsolete

there be bit of Trons code all over
Krod give DRezz and Ibeem the
escape coordinate tron used on i



coordinate capture

that be where tron will bail out
we will make sure he need to
go set
up the trap
you only get one shoot at this big
guy
stop he but do not destroy
he right
he be get data i need

if this be Trons territory he will
know we be here
he will hide

he can not resist a grudge match
he will take risk trying to beat i
that be how we trip he up
whip it out

you do not bring one

i do not have one

hey not a problem

hop on

hang on Krod




i upgrade i unit

you be awesome man
i hate you

mmmm
hack i

resource conflict
fatal crash
imminent

any sign of he

everything look the same to i
everything look the same
the same
the same

Krod snap out of it




tron will never expose himself

the same



yes i see
perfect trap
this be
going to be good
climb climb



it futile

look

remember the plan Krod
do not bail
out until the last millisecond

hang on tight mega

mmmm





here they come



Wuss
you call that speed





hey what be you

no
it be



i i

no
it be Krod
tron be




there he go

we have get he now
let we go

i could have do that



we can not go any far

what be it

do not ask dude

it be a memory leak once it start
it infect everything

touch it and you crash forever
we
cannot risk it

i agree

then it be settled



stop
listen to i
you might not
believe there be a world outside of
this one but let we just say a guy
named sinclair be depending on i
if tron get through here then i can
too
who be with i

good
Ibeem take Drezz see what be
up ahead
we will guard this portal
until you come back

well show i how to use mine

no problem
it be all in the velocity
vector ratio




report

we interface with tron
he escaped
into a dark zone





the random one have proven effective

he be all glitch and bad data
he
virtually get we derezzed
i
recommend we terminate this mission

no
proceed
if you keep tron on
the run he cannot attack XNet

it be a poor allocation of resource

you have you instruction

all glitch and bad data
what be
up with you
ever since i get here
you have be working against i

i act as Plexor program i

blah blah blah
you have get you own
processor
i can feel it working
overtime
do meg program you to
mess with i

i have no match for meg

first you do not want to come with
i then you be all over i on the
light cycle so you can dump we
over and blow the plan
we would
have nail tron by now if it be not
for you
what be you malfunction

do not troubleshoot i




the most effective alternative be to
return to the main and anticipate
Trons next attack

you ram hog

it be what i be programme to do

what be you do with she

nothing
she have a glitch
i be
just ping she

she let you



there be a way through

tron attacked we
Drezz have he
cornered

we have get he now




Akakakaka Agggggggg

guy
go around behind tron

ouch



hey
pick on somebody you own size

you have get no data on i

Drezz pull i up




hang on man




i know who you be
Encom security
program tr

who be you user

who programme you
i know you
encryption code
tell i you user
or i shut you down

i can shut you down with a nine digit
code







tell i tron
who programme you
here you encryption code








you get he




game over dude

you crashed he

it be more than i wanted
now i will
never know who he user be

we be hero

i will be upgraded

they will give we a slot in the main
server

i will be upgraded
i will be

rush now you can finish ping
megas

where be mega

she be just here

right behind i



mega




i recognize
trouble

they be scanning we

Ibeem go for help
zap you butt
out of here



it have to happen
but why now of
all time

user show up

yeah i be a user
superior being
the first to enter this realm
and
you be

the first

flynn
how can you be here




you know this dude

yeah he be a lunatic

rush Nortebi
i remember hiring
you

somebody tip these guy off about
we

not soon enough

you be not suppose to beat tron
i think for sure he would finish you

thanks

you destroyed we last hope

i detect a pattern in she behavior

she be a spy

no wonder i could not figure it out
i assumed tron user be on the
outside
if i would known this i would
blown past he and come straight for
you




i failed we because

you do everything you could

flynn never die
because you quantum digitizer work
that be how you get here
i know
that be how i get here too

the day after i hired you you start
sucking up to sinclair
you think
i do not know
bet he offered you
a partnership for this right
you
have no idea the damage you have do

i be only get start
man you
be the company joke
now i see
why
you melt down you lab to
take this little joyride
you get
stick here so all you can do be wreck
other people hard work

open you eye geek
i lab be
rig
i death be no accident
i push the button just in time to
escape
almost in time

you be paranoid
who would want you
dead




the same guy i programme tron to
shut down
same one you have be
sucking up to
sinclair
and he
cyberhenchman Plexor

too many of you brain cell have
get zapped in here old man

rush you lamer
you have be working
for the bad guy

he get away

let we move
XNet goon will soon
be all over this place










to rush

i hired sinclair as Encoms business
guy so i could do the dream
right off he wanted to capture the
market on data transmission
have
this plan called XNet base on
flawless efficiency hyperlock
security encryption protocol
uniformity
blah blah
i be the
boss i told he to forget it
i
know it could go bad
but the guy
have trouble taking no for an answer
he arranged for i lab to melt down
sinclair take over i company and
put XNet on a fasttrack
and here
where it be bring we

what be they do

beating the competition

they have get we outnumber

we have get to choose we battle
wisely
this way




rush why be XNet do this

no
let i daddy go

how long have this be going on

for year





sinclair never told we about this
XNet be create the very terror
that make people want the security
of Xnet

no more glitch freezeups or shut
down
once XNet be open Plexor
will destroy all other system
all
data flow will be controlled by his
master user



sinclair

all data flow sinclairs to control
and abuse
bank account medical
history you blockbuster account
you buy pattern you email
and to think rush all this time
you have be working trying to
impress a he








turn left now
turn right now
left
right



sinclair betrayed i

finally you get it

tron be we late hope

we have get to stop this




rush be trying to expose we

they do not see we
keep moving

we have get to tell people on the
outside

Plexor shut down all the port
only communicate with the outside
sinclair hold all the card

how do you get here

megan randall send i
she user
she fixed you lab and
send i here to take out tron

megan randall
i remember she
smart wise beyond she year
i
can not believe she would fall for
sinclairs lie



what happen to they

try to attack Plexor headon this
be what happen
because of you
there will be millions more



lock up these two
we will hold they
for ransom
or use they for target
practice

flynn
you think i be sinclairs
flunky but i be not

i be sorry about tron

yeah we be sorry

we be just do a job we have no
way of knowing the truth

no way at all

flynn i be wrong about you
you have
be do the right thing in here
Plexor have to be shut down
sinclair
have to be exposed

like he said

Krod and i be ready to help

we be

mega what do you read in he

independent operate instruction




he will act as necessary to increase
probability of he own survival

you do not know i

he cannot to be trusted

trust
you be the one who be be
lying to i the whole time

megas be risking she existence
for we because lamer
that be more
than you will ever do
lock they away

yo soup
eh
XNet rule man

hey Krod
shut down





halt
state encryption code







you be positive tron be destroyed

i observe it directly
rush turned
tron into vaporware

rush claim to be a user
he must
be
he be awesomely skilled

user do not exist

he be but a randomize program he
get lucky
to we benefit

rush and Krod be surround by
stealth fighter
they be lead by
another user called flynn

flynn

yeah that be the one

flynn
be here
he be the one
behind this scheme to crash XNet



i know where they be
rush and
Krod need we help

and what of mega

we could not find she
i be certain
they capture she too

tron be go but he user live

good work do not go unrewarded at
XNet
would you like to be upgraded

yes Plexor very much so





you be not going to believe this

convince i

sales office have be flooded with
call
major bank airline city
government the president of
nation they all want to sign up
for XNet now
we be not even on
line yet and we be a hit



we be the only port in the storm

brilliant

what uncertainy




the user called flynn be here

that be impossible

flynn command the intruder tron

you have get to be wrong about this

i be programme errorfree
by
you

flynn
escaped

he lead a group who seek to prevent
the open of XNet
the one called
rush have joined they



rush
i guy
what lie have flynn
filled he with

or what truth

this world can never know all i have
do
you have a plan to contain
flynn

of course

do not just contain he
destroy
he

instruction received
and the one
called rush

he know too much
get rid of he

instruction received



and whatever you do do not let they
hit you here

all XNet program have a weak spot
there

hear that Krod
never let they get
to you weak spot



Gurfle
i never know that

we be ready for you now



if XNet be allow to open it be the
begin of the end of a free and
open cyberspace
we can not let Plexor
get away with this
we game plan
have not changed
tron be specially
programme to break into XNet and
shut down power supply
we would
then exploit these weak point and
cripple the system
Trons role be
essential one of you must take his
place

who among you can power Trons disk
and carry out he mission

it be the most dangerous job
if
you be not up for it nobody going
to blame you



there be other way to crash Plexor
i will return to he he still trust
i
i will get close and crash he
with direct contact

it be futile
Plexors personal
defense measure be massive

enemy scout headed this way





disperse to all sector









the invader tron crashed here

this be a prefer gaming arena
for the user called flynn
he move
be predictable recursive easily
trace

that way



down there





fan out
search every buffer and
cache



hey
down here



get we out of here



dude be we glad to see you

you destroyed tron

yes
where be mega

she be not with you



she be with flynn
i mean totally
flynn

flynn be smart enough to interrogate
she first

right

she contain sensitive data
flynn
cannot be allow to hack she

yeah only we kick Flynns butt
too

you should have see it
flynn will not
be a problem

then
why be you imprisoned

ambush

delete they all






it be a

retreat
over that way
move around
they flank

Arrrgghhh







thanks

i will never let you forget it

rush we be screw
now everybody
after we

nah we be cool
we be with they







awesome
can i do one



quick
this way

mega move aside
i will finish
he

strike we down
there will always
be more to oppose you

what program have he install
in you

flynn
go with the other
run

i be not leaving you with this phreak



Plexor get over the control thing

drop the disk

i will be damn

rush



be that all you have get

Raagghh

rush
this way




delete they



this way
down the pipe

he be good than i think

he be be send for a reason

what reason

do not know yet
sometimes we have
to trust the big plan

mega
quick
jump







we get she

you committed a fatal error

they strategy and tactic lie
encrypt in she memory
bring she
i will hack from she what i need



i get it i get it i get it





shove it
go

i remember now
nothing to it

check it out

look out

what









i be cool
not a problem

they take mega



she can handle herself for a while

how do we attack Plexor next

you be with we now

do you know hard it be
opposing
the power of Plexor

it be like the fortysixth level of
ConquerDome
while winning a
side game of tetras ultra do six
instant message and debug a
demo

all at the same time

i be there
Krod too

say what

we be going to need all the help we
can get
boole can we make it to
the dark zone from here

there be one possible route

we will meet up with the code monkey
and combine force





horde of capture program be lined up for termination
among they
wounded fighter from the hideout raid

we give it everything

we can resist

you treat i like i have be corrupted

i cannot predict the random effect
flynn might have cause in you

you programme i to gather
intelligence
that be all i have ever
do

how long have you known flynn

enough time to gain he trust

you behavior be highly authentic

to he
it have to be

have you allow flynn to complete a
full interface with you

i be programme to allow such access
only to you Plexor
she eye lock on he
he be satisfy

flynn claim to be a user
as do
the one called rush

user do not exist

you have see nothing to make you
doubt this




nothing

they possess no power beyond those
of routine program

i have no knowledge of such power
she step down
they walk out of the chamber

still there be something about they
i cannot compute
flynn plan to
attack i do not he

yes
and rush will fight by his
side

where will they strike

flynn do not decide until the hour
of he attack
but he trust i
completely
when he know the place
i will know it as well

perfect
they will be meet with a
final thrash
yes let they come
they pass through the gate arrive in the corridor

have you far instruction for
i

none for now
but stay close
they lock gaze
barcode data surge between they

you come to i full of glitch and

look at you now
what an extraordinary piece of
program i have make of you
i
created XNet to the same standard
of flawless beauty
soon it
perfection will become all that be
and all that ever will be




all event remain under you control
with a smirk and a final jolt of data Plexor leaf she


Plexor cross into he inner sanctum
raise he disk

mega appear on a balcony above in the shadow secretly
observe Plexor


howl barren dim
circuitry left unpowered for eon
rush and Krod follow flynn and fighter into treacherous
canyon across vast plane
rush hear something and pull the group behind cover

over there
three massive rumble by
imprisoned
in the rear be hundreds of program
cruiser blast a path
through mountain and speed away

those program think they be just
be transferred

can we take out those XNet guy

we force be too thin
we can not
risk a battle that would reveal this
position
from another direction appear two code monkey program

flynn
down here




flynn
enter
we configure a base



good to see you guy
when do the
XNet goon start patrolling all the
way out here

they be everywhere now
take all
program by force

come
there be much to report
they head down into


deteriorating silicon lattice
flynn rush Krod and fighter
arrive to a meager encampment

greeting

hey guy
this be rush and he main
man Krod
they defect from Plexors
force to fight with we
buzz of hope penetrate gloom
nobody have defect from
Plexor before

we make progress decoding XNets
power supply encryption

excellent
let we see
in a makeshift lab demonstrate working at
mindboggling speed assembling a small intricate


i have see that somewhere

it be the encryption pattern on
Plexors disk

good eye
we have get mole program
who score chunk of Plexors personal
code anywhere they can find it
these guy fit the piece together



it can take a quadrillion
combination

we just snag the last piece but
the battle cost we big time

how many of you crashed
head shake somberly

the Teraflop boy
Algebrat

all that survive you see standing
here

oh geez
flynn falter on he bad leg
Quantz and boole support he

time be running out
rush approach code monkey as they toil blurspeed trying
to fit the final code piece a flat square
pyramidal
look exactly like the XNet desk toy we see in Rushs
cubicle

yow
i get tire just watch these
dude
rush see
compiler try to fit the square inside the
pyramid

just for laugh try putting the
circle on top of the pyramid

that be incongruous

if i be wrong ding i

what have we get to lose
try it
code monkey place the square on top of the pyramid



bingo
square spin into a circle latch and the entire
Hologon lattice
intricate code pattern

not bad

good thing you do not terminate we

how do we use this thing to shut
down Plexor

it be a copy of Plexors master key
we can break into any XNet facility
and fry the power supply

but once Plexor know we have it
he will change the code

yep
we have get one shot

then we should take out the power
supply to Plexors main server

yes
take out Plexors central
server

hang on guy that be not as easy as
it sound

i be inside the main server i see
how it be laid out

i used to work there
i will recognize
where everything be

we can take it

hit Plexor where he life




even with this key it will not

we can pull it off can not we flynn
one final assault on Plexors central
server

shut he down forever
all eye on flynn
Rushs naivete have ignite false hope in
the fighter

of course we can
flynn force a smile

hey the future depend on we
how
could we fail


sinclair come off the secure elevator find meg and dewey
at work on quantum digitizer

it be almost fix
i will be able to
bring back rush soon

excellent work
unfortunately i be
shut down this project

what

something come up
the company be
at stake
i can not go into detail

but rush would have no way to return

meg
i will never hold you
responsible
this be a tough call
but it be mine
dismantle and destroy
all of this equipment and software
immediately



well

meg
i be not asking

i understand
he shoot a look and exit


compiler crew work at megahertz speed
extend
and converge
switching station assemble
crew shift to
new assignment
pull wide to see dismal ground below
dark zone emit
woeful blip of random energy
pillar descend from XNet crew above and into the
old silicon planting themselves deep and impervious
rush stand on a vista point aghast as XNet construction
dominate the landscape

it be a bummer be on the lose
team huh rush
flynn sit nearby trying to patch he corrupt leg

we will trash XNet
then we will go
back to the we world and expose
what sinclairs do
he look at Krod boole Quantz and code monkey in the
distance preparing for battle

do they have any idea we world
exist
do they understand what a
user be

program once connected freely with
they user
but Plexor shut down
the port sever all link
he control all contact with the
world we once know
program operate
on he instruction or none at all



or yours

it be nothing to brag about
we be
get we butt kick

it there a way to contact meg
she
can transport we back to we world
maybe it be good if we fight sinclair
on he own turf
flynn lay a somber gaze on he eager fighter

i give up the idea of going back a
long time ago
you should too

what do you mean

sinclair do not get where he be by
be dumb
even if we survive
Plexors force in here sinclair
will make sure we never get back
home

but
meg said

i be sure she will do everything she
can
it might not be enough
flynn remove a coverplate from he leg trying to hide the
damage from rush
suspicious rush pull the plate aside

oh man
Flynns data corruption have worsen
he leg throb with
the drab glow of irreversible

why do not you tell anyone it be
this bad
flynn look at he leg
then at rush

rush
i think meg suspect the truth
about sinclair




that be why she send you here
she
know you be the one guy who could
find out

i think she hated i

she believe in you more than you
believe in yourself
it sink in
wow

do we really have a shot at winning
against Plexor

we have he master key
and we have
mega work on the inside

mega
be you sure about she
i
get the feel she play both side

Plexor programme she to perform his
will
he be a control freak
i be
not
i programme she to have a
will of she own
whatever she
decide it be up to she

sound dangerous

sometimes you have get to trust the
big plan
Krod and fighter approach

ready to rock and roll

guy
rush be right about we
final attack
if we have only get one
shoot we should go for Plexors
central server
if we insert the
hologon key in the main power supply
we can trigger a meltdown
Plexor
will be have he good troop standing
in we way




get past they be the ultimate
task i programme tron to carry out
he take up Trons dark disk

i turbocharge he to burn hot and
burn fast
who else could handle
the operate code in this disk
he extend the disk to rush

you

Uhhh i do not think so

it could mean the difference between
winning and losing

hey i will try
rush hold off Krod take the disk

what do i do
wave of Rushs surge into disk circuitry

yow
he buckle and shake
hand zap
knee trembling

steady
it be all about giving as
much as you get
let it become a
part of you
rush clench tooth concentrate
grip the disk
energy surge back and forth up Rushs arm around the
disk
he hold tight ready to scream

awesome dude
do not let go
fighter be amaze as
and body circuit in the ruby circuitry pattern
of






damn look at that
he do it
rush look at he arm astounded
he circuitry strobe in
hue of brilliant red
disk animate and unfold reveal
infinite surface variation
rush feel new power surging inside he body
he eye
harden keen like Trons
rush go airborne
land on a ledge high above
amaze balance


excellent move dude

it feel
awesome
Rushs voice be a little deep with a digital edge
it
surprise he
he cock he disk and
disk rocket across the landscape a mile away and
an blast it to bit
disk arc high
shoot back toward rush
rush look worry for a second ready to duck

do not flinch rush
it be you disk
now
disk snap back into Rushs hand painlessly
throbbing
with energy

oh man this be good
rush pull a new from a thigh bracket
it extend
into a hundredfoot vault pole
rush across the
canyon land with precision
light pole retract into the
wand in a nanosecond

Awwwww
where can i get one of those
another two vault and a leap rush toss he disk into a
spiral step off it midair and land
perfectly rejoin the group
cheers from Krod Quantz boole and code monkey
flynn
shake Rushs hand energy surge between they




it be for real Quantz

we have get a chance to take down
Plexor


Plexor review a line of elite XTakks
all be deck in
thick battle gear gripping an array of menace ultratech
weapon

perfect
any three of you could
crash an army of Flynns best
but
i have prepare for he random act by
designing massive redundancy
widen to reveal
of XTakks lined in precise row filling the
vast hall
since adolf hitler no one have displayed such an
awesome military machine


mega sneak in alone
she pull she disk off she back and
raise it above she head
data energize around she
she
clench hard trying to make the connection
converge off she disk reaching skyward


meg and dewey work to dismantle the lab
meg walk past stop
come back
read fresh text on a
computer screen


dewey
this you idea of a joke



Cybavor program complete

yes



demonstrate
XNet specialist drop the side on a cubic cage
freeze doglike stand like a statue
Plexor nod
XNet specialist activate
Cybavor come alive
circuit
eye pulse
Plexor summon an XNet worker drone

install yourself over there
worker drone do as he be tell
he freeze in place

attack
Cybavor leap like a hyena bound the length of the hall
at the worker drone
and mercilessly
energy spark fly circuit zap as the Cybavor digest the
energy then
then regrow the miss halve
now the Cybavor be a of nasty snarl Cybavors

end routine
Cybavors sit

elegant
survey he perfect defenses he notice one thing miss

where be mega

only you be authorized to monitor
she coordinate

download force
await i command

download



XTakks file out in perfect line turn perfect corner
dispersing into the compound
each one move in exactly the
same way
Plexor turn sharply to exit encounter
mega
stand
there obediently


on the fortress perimeter XTakks stand watch at the base
of a deep security moat
they turn eye scanning
behind they a extend
into the canyon then swing across
it be tronified rush use he vaulting pole to ferry
fighter across the moat edge
he return to the far side landing momentarily on a lone
central pinnacle to make the distance
rush vault back to gather Krod who be the last to cross

do not take this the wrong way

do not drop i
he hug Krod and vault they across
Krod cling and
struggle then
XTakks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edge
on top of the pinnacle rush and Krod hunker
flynn signal
from the far side stay down

XTakks patrol below pause to gaze up
atop the pinnacle Krods circuit energyzap with fear
rush hold he down
at last XTakks move on
rush extend he light pole to the moat floor vault to
the far side with Krod
Krod stabilize look around

yeah i recognize this place
i
know where everything be


he head off encounter a dead end
Quantz pull he the
right way


boole and code monk t help flynn to a secluded data buffer

rush up there
see it
rush leap to a high circuitry nexus

i hope you be right about mega
rush touch circuitry energize it with data
megas image appear in circuitry energy pattern

you
where be flynn

we be all here

i arranged for you entry
an
encryption portal have be left
unlock
path
do you
know the way
rush look down to code monk r
he give a high sign


mega watch glowing circuity image of rush

we get it

hurry
she deactivate
Rushs image vanish
mega think for a moment we be not sure what then walk
around a corner
bump smack into
Plexor
flank by he two snarl Cybavors



you contact they

yes

and

i give they the portal address
they will attempt entry soon

perfect
we will be waiting


patrol of XTakks pass
rush leap to a vantage point they
scout a route signal
flynn Krod boole Quantz and the code monkey
fighter team scale a narrow ledge near the
it be like a sheet of molten lead pouring endlessly before
they
lethal barrier

this be all yours rush
rush pull he disk hold it over he head and step under
the molten data flow
he struggle against raw power disk
splash aside the molten data

go
quick
code monkey flynn and Krod Quantz and boole dive between
Rushs leg emerging on the other side
barrier overcome
rush leap out of the firewall clutch he whitehot disk

no sweat


that way to the portal

let we do it


they head for the fortress along a surreptitious route
avoiding XTakk patrol


Plexor with mega and the Cybavors two pace behind lead
an army of XTakks
Cybavor growl at mega
she growl back

there it be
that be the portal
Plexor mass he force around a close
it be a dark semispheric aperture left unlock

converge on all level
outside
patrol close in behind these
coordinate
XTakks come from all direction all level


flynn pause to see XNet patrol in motion across bridge
through tunnel
all around

something up

keep moving
they come to a dark encryption portal see from they
exterior view

portal
this be it
flynn withdraw the

the sooner rush get this into the
main power supply the sooner XNet
shut down
and the more of we come
out of here to tell about it
rush take the hologon stow it
pumped look between code monkey boole and Quantz
Krod
tremble



oh man i think i be leak

Krod
you will do great

think so

you recognize pattern good than
any of we
you will know Plexors
move before he do

i hope you be right
rush

yeah man

be you really a user
be there
such a thing
be that what make
you so good
all program hang on Rushs answer
flynn too

flynn and i come from a realm no
good or bad than here
one
thing i know neither place work
unless you be looking out for the
other guy
and we have get a word for
what all of you be

obsolete

hero

cool

i be ready

let we do it
fighter hustle under the shadow of the portal
approaching
the close semispheric aperture



XTakks stand thick weapon pointed at the close aperture
Plexor mark time
Cybavors poise to attack
mega emotion rising take a step back


flynn falter on he wound leg
fighter steady he
rush step forward place a hand on the semispheric aperture
mechanism activate


Plexor tense eager for the slaughter
XTakks cock weapon take careful aim


flynn code monkey Quantz boole Krod
gathering near
rush
revealing a stun view of
the inside of the fortress
not an XTakk in sight

nothing to it
rush lead group inside


Plexor grow impatient
sense trouble



XNet specialist activate portal
Semispheric aperture
iris open to reveal
XTakk patrol
charging in from outside
no fighter in sight


InsideXTakks and outsideXTakks take order literally
they at
many crash zap and fizzle
Cybavors leap in devouring corrupt XTakks
the two
Cybavors use energy food to bifurcate into


they do so instantly
Plexor fume

you have be tricked
he spin to find mega go

mega have betrayed i for the last
time
she be with the fighter
find they



mega from the scene
around a corner she collide
with rush flynn Krod fighter
breathless

flynn
keep moving
this way

i be proud of you mega

i linked with
user exist
she instruct i

go meg
she glance over the new tronified rush
despite herself
she be impress
but there be no time for talk

which way to the power supply

Ummmm
that way


rush leap to a high ledge to confirm
massive throbbing
power supply lie at the center of the fortress
concentric square
high sign to Krod

you be right
there it be

and here they come
rumble precede
of XTakks coming to get they

break out the toy
XTakks be upon they and the battle be joined
XNet disk fly by the hundreds
Krod and code monkey fire a projectile which open
midair into a superwide circular magnetic field net
field suck in XNet disk and zaps they to ash
XTakks charge
rush flip down from above throw trondisk
disk ricochet of ten XTakks mow they down
rush retrieve he disk land near Krod and fighter

block this choke point slow they
down
can you guy do it

not a problem
he throw he disk behind he back take out an approaching
XNet goon
rush hurry away with mega and flynn
Krod Quantz boole and code monkey be besiege by a hundred
XTakks

whoa
retreat
that way
keep
fire


Plexor enter the battle arena with he four
he
scan keenly then head off another direction



flynn hobble helped by mega
rush lead they around a
corner in sight of

massive reactive
rush come to the edge of a deep narrow moat
bottom be a
channel of
no bridge

we have to get across

six XTakks be upon they disk flying NegaByte eraser
beam swinging
flynn take a hit in the chest


rush and mega dodge fling they disk with lethal accuracy
XTakks crash and fall tumbling into the moat abyss flashing
as they hit the molten bottom


Krod boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of XTakks code monkey
spring a which cut off a column at the
base
column tumble crash XTakks block the way
high fives among Krod and fighter
one small XTakk break through through the air
reforming
fighter turn to blast he
but Krod recognize the pattern

wait
i know that dude
Quantz stun an XTakk soldier code monkey hack he XNet
armor
armor power down revealing

Ibeem
Ibeem shake off he brainwashing



Krod i friend
who be these guy

we be taking out Plexor
you with
we or they
XTakks attack the group including Ibeem
Ibeem zaps away reappear next to an XTakk
he steal
the XTakks and mow down three XTakks
saving trap boole

with you
Ibeem join fighter as they press deeper engaging the
next XTakk onslaught


rush and mega haul flynn along a narrow ledge

there
you can make it across
he point to a thin ledge on the other side far below
rush extend he light pole to the ledge move to gather
flynn for a vaultcrossing

no take mega
i will stay here and
run interference

you have not get a chance by yourself

ah these guy be wimp
it be bravado
they know he odds be dismal
flynn slump
into an alcove which be only big enough for he
he pull
a supply of ready to defend himself

we be not leaving you

i body be weak but i will be
strong
i promise no matter what
they do to i i will survive this
trust the big plan


he be fade fast

but flynn
XTakks attack along the ledge



rush throw he arm around mega and across the moat
landing on the far side gain a slim foothold below a
core
flynn choose he moment lean out and throw
he mini
disk take out XTakks on the ledge
they body tumble
into the moat flashing as they hit
flynn spin the wall behind he open
at the end of a
square corridor stand

flank by he four snarl Cybavor beast

flynn
you moment of obsolescence
be upon you
across the moat rush and mega climb to the entry point
flynn play for time stalling Plexor so he do not catch
sight of they

freedom Plexor
it be the good
idea
that be why mega choose i side

if an idea be erase from all memory
bank it can be neither good nor
bad
when each alternative have be
remove XNet will simply
with a hand signal he command he Cybavors
they raise
up poise to attack flynn

crash i
hack i
do what you
want
the yearn for freedom will
last forever

nice speech

he flick a finger
Cybavors gallop at flynn



rush and mega gain foot at the entry point
they turn at
the sound of
across the moat a gutwrenching sight
all four Cybavors pounce on flynn hurl he off the ledge
maul he as they go down divide into eight plummete
toward the far below
Plexor step out of he corridor relish the view
remain
of fall body into the inferno

Noooooo
Plexor see mega and rush on the other side

over there
surround they
bridge instantly extend from outer square to
XTakks stream across fire


rush and mega duck inside entry point pelt by disk
before they
vast brilliant energized
power
surge in ring draw down huge column
every piece of
geometry be base on perfect square make of mirrorfinished
rare earth element
rush pull the into view
facet resonate with
energy pattern like those in the core

we plug this into the control cell
XNet be history

let we do it for flynn
they share a heartbeat of solidarity
rivalry go
XTakks stream in fire
rush and mega charge the center throwing disk fighting
backtoback


problem be move continuously down the column
and the column be space close leaving just enough time
between ringpasses to jump through


he and mega nearly raked by downflowing
XTakks fire but many of the beam be
catch in the energy flow and suck away
that be how intense
this place be
XTakk soldier be graze stumble into

rake down and he nasty reducing he to bit sucking
he energy to the level below
rush and mega encounter oncoming XTakks they must split
up
they fling disk taking out XTakks dodge fire
working they way deeper
meg and rush throw they disk simultaneously
both disk
score hit then arc to return
rush and mega catch each other disk
they each look at
the strange disk it be just not the same
the do a quick
swap and keep fighting

over there
the
dead center


rush and mega battle off three XTakks the way be clear
rush leap crash plane of silicon
stow he disk pull
out the
spot the control cello key receptacle
rush move to insert the hologon
he arm fly wild


drop from above riding an

where do you get that
no one
know this code but i



you software have the big flaw
there be Plexor
you can not see you
own mistake
Plexor snatch he Deathdisk corner rush for the kill
megas disk crash silicon come at Plexor but he
defense field repel it
he slam it aside and it be raked
away by downward flow energy ring
rush at
he be like a statue
but this time
hold he and infuse tronenergy breaking down Plexors
defense field eating into he body circuit
it be fractal
zap firework evenly matched foe battling faceto
face

do it mega
mega scoop off floor make for
Plexors hand shoot out stop she like iron
Plexor exert he power hold rush and mega by the throat
with he two hand backing they toward a surface ripping
with
rush and mega struggle an inch from death

Plexor stop annoy
turn and see
Krod fighter and Ibeem have arrive firing blaster at
Plexors
it hardly make a dent but it create
a fleet opportunity for rush
rush duck forward he disk off he back smack
Plexor in the throat
mega fall clear
rush hurl Plexor against energy ring energy rake down
he body but he fight the effect an
he step away shake off the damage retrieve he disk into
a hand
mega snag the hologon


she toss it to rush who be already airborne
rush catch hologon sail to the control unit



jam hologon into it receptacle
Plexor cock he death disk
Hologon with
shockwave
energy ring go dim then dark
silicon shatter to ash
XTakks power down
XNet armor derezzes leaving innocent
civilian program
they shake off the mindcontrol and rise
unshackled
and Plexor like all thing XNet chatter and glitch
he code erode he bit darken the fiber of he being
erode from inside

now who be obsolete
rush execute a final leap extend he foot for the final
blow straight at Plexor shattering he to bit
rush finally breathe
see Ibeem Krod Quantz boole
code monkey

thanks guy

i will never let you forget it
boole toss rush he trondisk


rush mega Krod Ibeem fighter and liberate program
stow disk and step to a high vantage point
before they expand a vista of cyberspace
Powerdown of XNet radiate in all direction leaving
everything else intact
beautiful exotic old data network
instantly begin to regenerate into the open space

we be free
at last we be free



sinclair command the podium

in a world exposed to increase
data corruption i hereby switch on
the first global network offer
guarantee data security
flawless performance zero downtime
the world work hard the world
deserve
he throw a switch
monitor blaze with XNet logo
and graphic portal
countdown




XNet instantly
all screen jam glitch and
crowd be stun
sinclair be mortify


Krod Ibeem boole Quantz and code monkey
mega embrace rush
energy sizzle between they

i underestimate you
thanks
she press she lip to he
it be electric

you know she always liked he

be she ping he

i can not see from here
but out of triumph a sudden concern
Rushs body shoot into mega into ground
circuit
lightshow overload intensify and spread
mega back away in pain



whoa ouch what
Ahhhhh

rush what be it
Rushs body into the energized circuitry

guy
mega

he reach a hand to mega
she but she
clasp he hand anyway

help he
code monkey attempt desperate measure but soon it be over
bit of rush dissipate into surround circuitry then
in blaze curtain like a quantum aurora borealis
mega be left with a handful of nothing

it be the way it should be

he be going back to the place he
belong


Rushs energy body hurl across cyberspace
bit streak light bend


rush materialize in the target chair
human flesh real
clothes
same as the moment he left
he bolt up realize where he be
look at he hand
see jojo the rat stare at he

back

he make it
rush
you okay
rush look around
mile and a group of oddly
familiar coworker
people who look just like Ibeem
Quantz boole and the code monkey

i meet a program you write
she be
just as incredibly beautiful and
confuse as you

i know
mega told i all about what
you do in there

she give you i coordinate
