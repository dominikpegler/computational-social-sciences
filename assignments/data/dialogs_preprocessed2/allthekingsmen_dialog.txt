be that a deal

now he have we all
i anne and
adam
now we all worked for he


and so the eye of the entire nation
be now focused upon governor willie
stark an amazing phenomenon on the
american political scene
the whole
state be filled with his
accomplishment each of they of
course bearing he personal
signature to make sure that no one
will ever forget who give they to
the state

this be the way the road used to
be
but there be those who claim
that they be adequate for the
people need that you do not need
a four or sixlane highway for a
horse and buggy

when stark boast of he great school
system he critic say
you can not
go to school and work in the field
at the same time
and they question
the benefit of these project
charging that the need and the poverty
of the people be as great as before

willie stark have never forgotten the
source of he power
the people who
supported he

he still keep in touch with these
people of the backwood making
periodic trip to such place as
Kanoma city now famous as his
birthplace

for those who say that willie stark
be a man of destiny there be other
who claim that he be a man of evil
a man who care neither for the people
nor the state but only for he own
personal power and ambition

obviously these ambition go far
beyond the boundary of the state
just how far only time will tell
meanwhile he be here

and from the look of thing he
be here to stay
willie stark
