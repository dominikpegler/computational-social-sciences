to see the bride before the wedding

governor weatherby swann it be be
too long

actually

in fact i do
mister mercer

Ahha
here the one for william turner
and i have another one for a mister
james norrington
be he present

what be the charge


i do not believe that be the answer to
the question i ask

lord beckett
in the category of question
not answer

we be under the jurisdiction of the
kings governor of port royal and you
will tell we what we be charged with

for which the punishment regrettably
be also death
perhaps you remember
a certain pirate named jack sparrow

captain jack sparrow

captain jack sparrow

you might

fifteen man on a dead mane chest
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
drink
and the devil have do for the rest
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Hahahahaha

sorry mate

mind if we make a little side trip
i do not think so

not quite accord to plan

complication arise ensue be overcome

you get what you go in for then

Mmhmm

captain i think the crew meaning i
as well be expect something a
bit more
shiny
what with the isla
de Muerta going all pear shaped reclaim
by the sea and the treasure with it

and the royal navy chasing we all around
the atlantic

and the hurricane

aye

all in all it be seem some time since
we do a speck of honest pirating

shiny

aye shiny

be that how you be all feeling then
perhaps dear old jack be not serving
you good interest as captain

Awk

do not blame the bird
show we what
be on that piece of cloth there

ohhh

know that do not do no good

it do i

it be a key

it be a draw
of a key
chinese man black man with a black
beard white bearded man with large
black hat

gentleman what do key do

key

thing

and whatever this key unlock inside
there be something valuable
so we be
setting out to find whatever this key
unlock

i care not for
curse aztec gold
i desire be not
so provincial
there be more than one
chest of value in these water
so perhaps
you may wish to enhance you offer

consider into you calculation that
you robbed i of i wedding night

so i do
marriage interrupt
or
fate intervene
you make great effort
to ensure jack sparrows freedom

these be not going to jack

oh really
to ensure mister turners
freedom then
i will still want that
compass
consider that in you calculation

you would be interest in the whereabouts
of you daughter

most recently see on the island of
tortuga then left in the company of
a known pirate jack sparrow
and
other fugitive from justice

including the previous owner of this
sword
i believe
we ship be in
pursuit
and justice will be dispense
by cannonade and cutlass and all manner
of remorseless piece of metal
i personally
find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board

you authority as governor you influence
in london and you loyalty to the east
india trading company

shall i remove these shackle

so you see mercer every man have a
price he will willingly accept
even
for what he hope never to sell

deck

i wager
ten year

i will match ten year

agreed

i understand
liar


it be a game of deception
you bet include
all the dice not just you own

what be they wagering

so any crewman can be challenged

i challenge davy jones

i accept
thatuh

the stake

i soul
an eternity of servitude

against

welcome to the crew liar

and be called a liar myself for i trouble
bootstrap bill you be a liar and you
will spend an eternity on this ship
master turner feel free to go ashore
the very next time we make port

fool
why do you do that

it be never about winning or losing

organ room

deck

it be not a fate you have to choose for
yourself either

they will know you helped i

i take this with a promise
i will find
a way to sever jones hold on you
and
not rest until this blade pierce his
heart
i will not abandon you
i promise

beckett

yes they be signed lord cutler beckett
of the east india trading company

agh

will be working for beckett and never
said a word

agh

beckett want the compass
only one
reason for that

of course
he want the chest

yes he do say something about a chest

if the company control the chest they
control the sea

truly discomfort notion love

and bad
bad for every mother son
what call himself a pirate
i think
there be a bit more speed to be coax
from these sail
brace the foreyard

might i inquire how as to how you come
by these

persuasion

friendly

decidedly not

will strike a deal for these and uphold
it with honor
yet you be the one stand
here with the prize
full pardon commission
as a privateer on behalf of england
and the east india trading company
as if i could be buy for such a low
price

jack the letter give they back

no
persuade i

you do know will taught i how handle
a sword

as i said
persuade i

it be a curious thing
there be a time
when i would have given anything for you
to look like that while think about
i

i do not know what you mean

oh i think you do

oh do not be absurd
i trust he that be
all

so you never wonder how you late
fiance end up on the fly dutchman
in the first place

strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open water

just put as many league behind we as
you can
as fast as you can

and what be we running from

that dress
where do you get it

it be find aboard the ship
the crew
it think it be a spirit bringing
some omen of i will fate

that be foolish

oh yes

Proceededly foolish

it bring good fortune
the spirit
told we
put in at tortuga
and we
make a nice bit of profit there

off the book of course

i imagine
some of you crew may have
jump ship there

why do you ask

captain a ship be spotted

color

she be not flyin any

pirate

or bad
