what

either she be a twin or he be a twin

he
he

or they be multiple personality or you be a twin or i be
a twin

because i do not know what be going on

you be nut

you know look

wait wait yeah

let i be logical about this

okay she be not a twin
we know she be not a twin

hey

what be you talking about larry

stay calm
i want to try and puzzle this out

i be calm larry
okay but okay she be a twin she be not a
twin
i mean now you be saying we be twin
what be
you nut
okay i be calm
i be calm okay

yeah i be going to be logical

all right all right

the um the first thing be this


we come home that night
there have be a heart attack

uh what if they induced it
you know some kind of
poison
we never see the body

you know it have to be some other woman
you know some
some woman who probably have some kind of ballpark
resemblance to mrs
house

the super say he see she but uh he be a drunk you know
mrs
house could have be hide

but youyou remember that you hear a noise that night
that have to be mrs
house leaving to check into the hotel

yeah
yeah
well

i can not sleep
i just i

no wait a minute wait

i be too you know
i be too

but it do not make any sense at all larry because
suddenly you know he murder she
i mean what be it all
about

let i let i call Vincents restaurant in new jersey
and why do not we go meet ted and marcia and get something
to eat and talk with they

wait a minute
at one in the morning
what be you talking
about
you mean
you want to

yeah so what
so what
it be so you know TedTed be
taking she to a show and tototo dinner
so they will be
there

all the way out to new jersey

so hey kid this be the apple
this be the town that
never sleep
that be why we do not live in duluth
that
plus i do not know where duluth be

lucky i

uh you really see he face

yes
oh yes i be here to tell you

you see you see what he look like
no question
you
know exactly who it be

oh no question about it
it wasIt be mr
house
there
be no
not a not a question
i mean you could see he
because uh you know there wasthere be just no way that
you could avoid it
he be right there

to i it be obvious

wh
how do you see it

how obvious
what do you mean

obvious he be committed the perfect murder

what do you mean

what
how
what do you mean

okay look
you have to start off with another woman who
bear some ballpark resemblance to mrs
house

yeah

that be what i said
that be exac
i used the term
ballpark resemblance myself

i know
you used the term right

it be i idea
i said what she said

they be with this woman

yeah


maybe have dinner
they do not induce a heart attack
because that be fiction bullshit

she have a heart attack
she drop dead spontaneously
they have no thought of killing she
maybe they wished she
be dead

why

i do not know
maybe they stand to gain if she die
they
see a golden opportunity

mrs
house dress she up in she clothes
she hide

this be i theory
exactly i theory

that be right
she check into a hotel

yeah well we get that far with the exception of the
actual spontaneous heart attack

okay you know the husband planning to go to paris with
this pretty young woman

yeah

yeah

he be cheating on he wife

yeah

so instead of finishing the scheme they planned he
doublecrosses she and kill she taking she share of the
profit

well you think you think helen moss be in on this too
huh

yeah a good chance she be aware

okay but what about mrs
dalton
he claim he take she to
the movie

she be he alibi
she covered for he when he strangled his
wife
she said he be at work all day

that be right because he introduce she as a colleague

wait why
why would she

she be a colleague who maybe love he

oh wait wait
he be cheating on she too

cheat on two woman

yeah yeah yeah
it be perfect
just it all fit

the guy do not look the part

the point be he be get away with the perfect murder
there be no body around to prove anything
and all the
paperwork be strictly above board
he be home free

oh i
oh where do you find this woman
she be a
genius

she be brilliant
she be brilliant
but the guy
he know
that we know so if he know we be on he

well he do not care
why should he
Everythings be
neatly dispose of
he be home free
only he and maybe he
mistress know the truth

well j

she be right there be no body

hold on hold on for a second
we do not know this be all
true
this be just a theory

yeah but it be a great theory
have you be paying
attention
this be a great theory

oh yeah
it sound good it hold water
everything fit
together in this

i be paying attention

i think it be great

when i come back from the lady room i will tell you how to
trap he

oh excuse i

WhereWhere do you find she
she isshe isshe be really
something

she mind it just go

yeah she be get one idea after another
it be like one thing
