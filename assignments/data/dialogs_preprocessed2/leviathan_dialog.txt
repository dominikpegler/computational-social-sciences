all day consulting with the good
people in maritime medicine the
good people in virus

and

and they do not believe the
symptom i described

why Sixpack

it could be a million thing
something in the air food
he look up and
lock eye with beck
but he go on that ship and so
do williams
i want to examine the crew

yeah
right

i have report the death to
the company

routine i ass
be not nothing
routine about no physical check
up foot down
especially
when we be get pick up the
next day

he do not say it be a routine
checkup he said it be a routine
precaution


must be bad
even sick
Sixpack never missed a meal

it be this fuck air system

be not the food or the
air system he be just sick
everybody get sick every
now and then

part of be human

i be sure as hell sick



i guess i be kinda
outta shape
this skin condition
what be it
like herpe or measles or what



it be difficult to describe

christ it would be a hell of a thing
if i go back to the roof with
some kind of herpe thing
i
wife would not understand that at all

you seem all right

she would not understand
she would
think i be down here fucking
i head off

this whole thing unnecessary doc
only skin problem i get be
white people
how come you be wearing those
glove



this disease
do you know
what cause it

not yet
you get any idea

you do not think it be from going
on that ship do you

that be a possibility
but if
it be that simple why have not
the symptom begin on you

you mean i be okay

you be fine



what do you mean a skin problem
you skin change

it blacken
become scaly

you mean like a fish

yes
like a fish

i be just joking doc

well accord to maritime law
you as commander of the shack
have the authority to dispose of
the body
however the company
do not want you to do that

what you do not understand be that
i crew be in jeopardy

but you do not have any proof
at this point to assume that
this disease be contagious do
you

i be not anxious to find out either

beck trust i
if the company
feel that you or you crew be
in any danger we would authorize
an immediate emergency pickup
we could be there in a few hour

do it

unfortunately
we can not

there be a typhoon about
mile off the coast of Baja
it be not coming you way but the
company do not want to lose
you folk or an emergency ship
should it veer you way

what be you saying
that we be
not even going to be pick up
tomorrow

it should not be a long delay

but it be a delay
how long
day
two day

twelve hour no big deal

one of we
ancestor
name for the
danakil alps in ethiopia

not exactly a big ocean
country

it be when it count a couple
of million year ago when the
sea come in and drive we into
the water
most homo sapien
do not make it
danakil man
adapt

some say that be why we be
basically hairless for less
water resistance fast swim
speed

but what about those scale
or that leechlike thing that
bit cobb

why stop with just one aspect
of marine life
why not incorporate
the good genetic component the
ocean have to offer

well if they be perfect an
aquaman then why be there a dead
one onboard that russian ship
why
be not he out swimming around

he obviously lack something
in he environment

turn black yet

that be not funny
