the workday



fred happily discard he hard hat leap out of the
canvasroofed cab on the dino back slide down the
tail and bounce right into the seat of he stone and
timber car

Therere two tiny little desk at the far end separated
by a flimsy divider
the single window here look out
over the quarry scrap heap
as we watch somebody dump
a load of debris

threadbare furniture on a wear rug sit under a portrait
of we founder

fred and barney look at all this in turn
pause
then
they whirl give each other highfives

allright

welcome to the top partner
and as they shake we


now accompany by heroic industrialtype we
see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation
this cannot be described now with appropriate justice
but it involve a series of animalpowered conveyor
belt Rube Goldberglike funnel spout and chute
and all sort of gadget gizmo bell and whistle
to wit



at one end of the build dinopowered dumpster and
lifter drop off all the ingredient
these get stomp
chewedbashed and otherwise reduced to powder which be
then mixed with
water into a foam which bubble through a long sawmill
type trough and be hold back by a gate
meanwhile we see a sample item in this case a stone
sofa as it be place before two goatasauruses which
butt head and smash the sofa between the two halve of
a clay mold
when the mold be open and the sofa toss
aside barney appear and personally aim the foam
trough at a funnel in the top of the mold
pause to
taste the mix he smile then shout

ready

fibre
barney pull a rope which open the trough
Fibrefoam
pour into the mold

get winch unpwards by monkey and then an alliga
torsaurus whaps it with it tail

presto
Fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drop neatly
out of the mold bounce lightly on the conveyor belt
below
it sparkle with the telltale celadongreen
shimmer of Fibrerock
as it chug along the process
repeat and soon a score of identical sofa be in view

as a beam fred watch worker easily stack the
Fibrerock sofa
nearby we see
Fibrerock window frame door chair etc

slate and lava watch the progress dollar sign in they
eye


Fibrerock product be stacked up everywhere stretching
away like the inventory in charles foster kanes
warehouse

fred mark another one
piltdown
do not even wait for the challenge take a giant step
oops
bad idea
the last line be at the edge of a
straight drop
piltdown yelp tread air in the good
cartoon manner and then desperately grab a handful of
freds clthe
both man fall at the last minute
piltdown catch a ladder

fred land with a thud right in the clay mold used to
form the fibre product
badly the impact arouse the
goatasauruses out of they sleep
dutifully they rise
and then ram both side of the mold just as fred be
struggling to he foot
freds yell be muffled by the
clay

aroused by the start up of the assembly line they do
they job
fibre foam begin to chug down the trough
the alligator crane pick up the mold shake it

be fling to the conveyor belt stiffly cake in clay

shudder and shake out a fibre statue of
fred

the real fred moving stiffly like a robot be get
to he foot when he fibre doppleganger slam he to the
mat again
moment later another fred drop down
beside he

have descend the ladder hopping mad
now he see
fred coming toward he
piltdown break a big lever off
the equipment swing react astonish as


back down the line he be see this
he claycaked
adams apple gulp
quickly he turn and try to
tiptoe away then with a and the
clay and fibre all over he solidify
desperate he
try to move
can not


watch confuse as dozens of fred flintstones chug
towards he on the belt
he shrug smash the next
one in line
another phoney
he smash the next one


dodge pyrite renew attack
now barney become
aware of the activate assembly line
get an idea
he move behind an inspection table grab a big rubber
stamp
pyrite come around the corner
Barneys head butt he
in the gut dodge under he leg
then as pyrite
stumble barney stamp he ass with the word

pyrite look back see this redden
raise he club

reject huh
whaddya say we
reject you head
he raise the club
when an alligator swing down and
grab he by the seat of he pants
pyrite drop the
club howl

the alligator crane swing he away and over a big bin
mark and drop he
howl pyrite fall into a big bin of break and
defective Fibrerock goods

chuckle to himself
and then look down react
and we see that piltdown have smashed yet
another of the duplicate freds
worried barney look around see that he be just above
the Fibrefoam chute
without another thought he jump
into it slide downward like a passenger on the
Magerock mountain log flume ride

piltdown be about to swing at the real fred when
barney sail out of the end of the chute and slam into
he and fred
all three of they roll across the floor
towards


where a squad of policeman have just appear lead by a
dripping wet feldspar and gravel

all right

wham
barney fred and piltdown roll right into the
cop who go flying like what else
tenpins complete
with appropriate sound

Whattya know
even get the spare
again
then he gasp as he look over at fred whose head have
just fallen off
pause
freds real head slowly poke up out of the clay
and fibre shoulder
before he can extricate himself
**further/far feldspar and he man be drag they out of
the build

slate city
it be even more grandiose than it
predecessor
now the house development have two huge
office building beside it and then a convention center
beyond that

as you can see the Fibrerock
be so light we be use it for
construction for furnishing
for everything
you can not stack
a twobedroom cave this high
but the sky the limit with
Fibrerock

Skys the limit
sky the
limit
why these two building
they
they practically scrape
the sky
we should call they
slate scraper

that be brilliant Unc
mister

help i with the centerpiece of
the complex
indicate the
convention center

slate so busy admiring he moment to himself he hardly
listen to what lava saying just run he stylus
through the wet clay of the statement meanwhile
frame the model city in he hand

heading for the
door
oh mister slate we be going
to hold the bedrock junior talent
show in the uh slate needle

good for public relation
lava break off
he be just look out the window and
see

small figure appear behind some of the equipment
tiptoe from console to cabinet and thus towards
the assembly line
wear sunglass with attach nose and a hookon
beard it at first appear to be some sort of bizarre
hermit or bum
and then we realize hey this be
barney

look around spot piltdown and pyrite now resplendent
in security guard uniform
lava whistle softly to get
they attention can not
then he see one of slate

look around carefully barney take out a thermos
bottle unscrew the top and quickly dunk it into the
