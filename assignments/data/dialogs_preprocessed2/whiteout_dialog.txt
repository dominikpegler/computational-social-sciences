this be not funny

where be pryce


what be that

vodka

find what you be looking for

just answer
those be fuel tank behind you
this plane be outfit for long
range capability

and by the look of that safe
must have be transport
something pretty important


they put some serious work into
this

whoever get hurt they drag he
out of here
there be blood all
over the tunnel

what be that

it be the cat

go

sonofabitch


no signal you

someone follow we

this be not going to work it be
like digging through concrete with
a spoon
we be going to suffocate before we
get out here

how long do you figure we have get

three of we down here
hour at the most

no way
i be not going out like
this
no way


and when that one go we be
screw

what about the vodka we could
make some torch maybe melt the
ice

fire will burn the quicker

what choice do we have

do not need i vote

hold these

what be you do


all these plane used to have bail
out hatch

we come in through it



have to be more than one

it would be on the ceiling in case of
an ocean land

find it

with the angle of the plane i
do not think we be that far from
the surface
give i a hand

these be explosive bolt
if we
blow the hatch maybe it will smash
a hole up through the ice

or if the ice be too thick the
blast will come right back at we

we can be blown up suffocate or
freeze to death
take you pick


this could work give i the
battery from you phone

when i connect these two wire
hopefully there be going to be a
big bang

buried in the ice

damn i know that government
eavesdrop be true

there be be rumor for year that
the russian have a second base
a secret weapon research facility
under the ice that supposedly blow
up in the late sixties nothing
be ever confirmed


the fact be before the treaty in
they be strip mining all
over the place down here we
believe for uranium and other
specialize mineral for weapon
use
it be the cold war
no one
know half the thing the
russian be up to
this plane
could be the link between rumor
and truth
and if it be true
what be in those cannister could
be a prelude to another terrorist
attack

why do you lie to i

look the you

carry a lot of
weight down here
think about it
if i have tell you i be
i


you would have be on the horn
