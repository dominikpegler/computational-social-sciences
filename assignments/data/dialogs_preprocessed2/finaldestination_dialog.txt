Thirtynine day have passed since
we have lost we thirtynine love one
friend and teacher

as each day pass without a
determine because for the accident
we ask ourselves why


ecclesiastes tell we man no more
know he time than fish taken in
the fatal net

or bird trapped in the snare

like these the child of man

catch when the time fall
suddenly upon they




and so before we can heal before we
can escape the presence of death
time we must mourn and celebrate
theirs with this memorial

hope you do not think browning that
because i name be not on this wall
that i owe you anything

i do not

re
victim
all i owe be these people
to live i life to the full

then maybe you should lay off the



do not ever fucking again tell i
what to do
i control i
not you

i be never going to die

i take i driver test this week at
the

low score but i

very young age

going to let i read it
it say what
i be feeling

because of you
i be still alive
thank you



we say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast


but when we say this we imagine
that the hour be place in an
obscure and distant future

it never occur to we that it have
any connection with the day already
begin or that death could arrive
this same afternoon




this afternoon
which be so
certain
and which have every hour
filled in advance







and they say that he get crazy
once and he tried to touch the sun




what happen
be tod alright



alex

get outta here

what
what happen


do not you
see it


could not you predict it
could not you read he mind

mr
Waggner


you cause tod so much guilt over
george staying on the plane that
he take he own life

he would not do it

he
he told i we would be friend
again after you get well
after
you get over george
why would he
make plan for the future if he be
planning on killing himself


all i wife and i will ever know be
we would not have lost we young
son
if you would told we old to
get off the plane




almost autumn

it be only the end of june

yeah but everthings always in
transition
if you focus even now
one week into summer
you can feel
autumn come
almost like bein able
to see the
future

know what this be

like um
you be mad about
something

piece of debris
from the plane
i go to the shore off the crash
site and it washed up on the beach

you go there
i have wanted to go
there but i think it be off
limit

it be
but that do not stop i
should not stop you

why be you there last night

look i have see enough

to know
the

i
do not investigate teen
suicide
but they be there last
night that mean
one they still
do not have a clue what cause the
crash
two they have not ruled out
anything
and the fact that seven
people get off the plane be probably
weird enough not to mention that
one of those people have a vision or
whatever of it explode minute
before it do explode be highly
suspicious
and it do not help that
the visionary friend just
commit suicide

why be you there last night

know what this be

it be you

not a likeness
it be how you make
i feel alex

i be
really sorry

like you the sculpture do not even
know what or why it be
reluctant
to take form
and yet create an
absolute but incomprehansible
attraction

before that day you be just
another suburban nothing that would
never have anything to do with i
life
and i be sure you think i be
some marilyn manson bodypierced
freak or whatever
but at that moment
on the plane
i feel what you feel
i do not know
where all those emotion be coming
from until you start freak out

i do not see what you see but i
feel it
okay i be not into all that
XFiles bullshit
but it be a
psychic connection
why to i
why
to you

and you can still feel it can not
you
something from that day be
still with you
i know because i
can still feel you

that be why i be there last night

i have never deal with death before
i be not alive when i grandparent
die
i wish i could know
i mean
all this
could just be in we
head
now it feel like it be
everywhere

it


what if tod
be just the first
of we

be that something you be feeling


i do not know
i wish i could just see
he
one more time then maybe
i would know

then let we go see he


give i a rush

this place

do something i be not suppose to

good call
very quincy


that
he

i think
but why they make he
up like
michael jackson

that be he but
he be not here
that
whatever
that whatever
make he tod be go





please do not yell


you will wake the dead

why


chemical in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasm

i be
a friend of he
he good
friend
see he father


i know who you be

they said he hung himself but
there be no mark


i crafted a reconstruction of the
laryngeal prominence region with
Velvetone surgical wax and
Permaseal

what be all those tiny mark




cuticle laceration

why would he pull at the wire if he
be commit suicide

why would they say it be a
suicide
if it be not

he father pretty fucked up with
denial
maybe he could not deal with
the thought of an other accident
taking another son


in death


there be no accident
no
coincidencess
no mishap
and no
escape

you saying tod do kill himself


suicide
murder
plane crash
what
do it matter
he be going to end
someday
from the minute you be cut
loose from the womb
it be a one
way ticket on a trip to the tomb


you may not realize it but we be
all just a mouse that a cat have by
it tail
every single move we
make from the mundane to the
monumental
the red light we stop
at or run
the people we have sex
with or will not with we
the airplane
we ride or walk out of
be all a
part of death sadistic design
leading to the grave

design


if life be like a box of
chocolate
death
death be like
a big milton bradley game of mouse
trap
the day you be born be just
the boot hanging from the
streetlamp kicking the marble to
get thing roll
growing up be
only the marble rolling down the
curving chute
you feel immortal
have survive school sex drug
n rock n roll but you have really
only upset the big hand holding the
steel ball that fall into the
bathtub
marriage and kid and
career seem to make it all worthwhile
until the ball hit the seesaw and
flip the dive man into the big
barrel
in the old folk home or the
hospital you just see the big cage
rattling down until it capture
the mouse
game over

maybe there be no way to win
but
if you figure out the
game
you know where the steel
ball be rolling could not you
avoid the trap and extend the
playing time
could not you
cheat
death at it own game


you already do that by walking off
the plane
now you get to out when
and how it will come back at you
play you hunch alex
if you think
you can get away from it
but beware the risk of cheating the
plan disrespecting the design
could iniciate a horrifying fury that
would terrorize even the grim reaper
and you do not even want to fuck with
that mack Daddie

i be sorry we broke in


no harm
no foul

we do not find what we be looking
for

yeah we do


i will see you soon




the mortician be whacked

he be trippin on formaldehyde

he said death have a design
even
before he said that i have be
seeing pattern

as in flannel and plaid

how many die on flight
from we group

Thirtynine

remember the gate number

no

Thirtynine

remember the departure time

like





do you know when i be born




right
april th

wait
i think you mean the time
of you birth
FourTwentyfive as
in month and day
that be a reach

i birthday be the same as of the
time i be mean to die
that be a
reach

you be sound like those people
who you know
oswald shoot
kennedy from a warehouse and hide in
a theatre and booth shoot lincoln in
a theatre and hide in a warehouse


i be not just layin down a bunch
of math here with this
i be talking
about indication
omen
that
day that we be mean to die
that
if we have be aware of
would
have saved everyone on the plane

that be total bullshit
you can find
death omen anywhere you want to

hey look
coffee start with a
and end with an
so do
the word choke
we be going to
choke to death
oh no
starbuck be
a whaler
we be going to be
harpooned

you will go nut if you start with
that shit

she be leaving the school
moving
away

clear how do we know that by
just sitting here breathing this
air or sip the coffee have
cross the street
we have not
start in motion the event that
will lead to we death
fifty year
from now
ten year
tomorrow
you do not unless
you be able to
open yourself to the sign i be
will to show you

i do not understand
do you see
tod die
do it happen again like on the plane

no but it might as well be the
same thing
this be a message
from someone or something
hint
at the design

alex on the plane
you must have
experience
some kind of hyper
awareness
but here
you be
suggest Tods death
and maybe
we own
will happen because of
an active presence

the mortician said death have a
design
now
if you i tod
carter terry billy ms
Lewton
mess up that design because for
whatever reason i be able to see
death plan
then we cheated it
but what if it be we time what if
we be not mean to get off that
plane
what if it be still be we
time
if
it
be still not
finished with we
we will all still
die
now not later

unless
we find the pattern
and
cheat it again

after hearing you just now
i do
believe

that tod killed himself

then there be no one left who can help
i

baby come on
not now

carter

kind of have a reunion here

let it go

when be you moving

i will not let that plane
crash be the most important thing in
i life

thing i need to understand before

to anyone about it



the national transportation safety
board have a new theory tonight on the
possible because of EuroAir flight



deterioration of silicon insulation
on an electrical connector to the
scavenger pump may have leak
combustible fluid



spark in the fuel switch



that be Tods seat



may have ignite the fuel line
and
proceed to the fuel pump


the path of the explosion
that be death design





some night i be wake up by the
sound of i own voice you know
inside i head going no you know

i do not believe you have magical
power
no one have any
control
over life and death
unless
that person be taking live and
cause death

i almost believe he

sometimes you give i the creep




when he first come to the mountain
he life be far away


you get to stop this

high

sky



rocky mountain high Coloradoh






ms
Lewton



they say that he get crazy once and
he tried to touch the sun

ms
Lewton


hey alex


i do not know where he be
he be not
talking to i

why

because i do not believe he

if he should contact you it
would be in the good interest
of you own safety to contact we


what be you do

Terrys name should be on this wall

so why you want we to meet you
here
now

they be watch i see if i go to
alex

be you

they will follow i car
that be why you be taking i

why would i want to see he

because he know which one of we
be next


um
okay
drive the speed limit
right

and do not pass on the right

billy
i be gettin a vision
you be the next one

hey man why you say that

because if you say another word
i be going to fuckn kill you

he could be anywhere from here to a
mile down the shore
you guy drive
down there start this way and we will
meet around the middle
it will take
half the time




be they up there

somehow
be still in flight
somewhere
be they still safe

when i be a kid like six or
seven
i used to worry so much
about i parent die
like lying
awake at night
just worry
i
loved they so much
i do not want
they to get hurt
and what would
happen to i
what would life be
like
every night
it seem

most kid do i guess

most kid never have it happen

when i be ten
i dad go into a
for cigerettes
i guess he hear
somebody say do not turn around
so
on reflex or thinkin a friend be
jokin
he do
and the guy blow
he head off

and let i tell you i have every
reason to worry before
because
life become shit
i do not blame she
i guess but i mom could not deal
with it at all
she married this
asshole who i mom with i real
dad would cross the street to avoid
this guy
he really do not want a
kid
and so i mom do not either
anymore i guess
if that be the design for i
father
and i family
then fuck
death

and so anyway
i have think of
that somewhere alex
it exist
that place

where i dad be still safe
where he
have a full pack of cigerettes and
keep driving
place where i and
i dad and i mom
be still
together
and have no idea about
this second life here
place where we friend be still
in the sky
where everyone get a
second chance

but that place might only exist in
i heart
and maybe now
yours
i
have not experienced too many second
chance in i life
i have not see
any
but because of all of this i
believe
because of you
i will
get a second chance
because of i
you will
with you in i life
that
place right now exist in we
heart will spring out
and become
a real part of this life

and that be the only way we can beat
death
by making something special
out of life

this will not be safe

those guy be probably fifteen
minute away

no
i mean i do not have anything
on i
this will not be safe

nothing be
anymore
