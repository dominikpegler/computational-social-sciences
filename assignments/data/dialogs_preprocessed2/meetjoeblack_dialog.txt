umm i do enjoy or rather i
be interest in meet john yes
terday impressive

this be what i wanted to do
i know
i be not going to write the great
american novel but i also know
there be more to life than buying
something for a dollar and sell
it for two
i wanted to give the
news to the world and i wanted to
give it unvarnished
the more we
all know about each other the
great the chance we will survive
sure i want to make a profit you
can not exist without one but john
bontecou be all profit
if we give
he license to absorb parrish
communication and he have he eye
on a few other after we we will be
appoint he to the position he
crave gatekeeper
in order to
reach the world you will have to go
through john bontecou
and not only
will you have to pay he to do this
far more expensive you will have to
agree with he
reporting the news
be a privilege and a responsibility
and it be not exploitable
parrish
communication have earned this priv
ilege john bontecou want to buy
it
as you chairman i urge you to
agree this company be not for sale

sound like you be not leaving
much room for discussion

sorry
i know it look like i be
reversing i field

that be you privilege bill
but
given we need given the absolute
necessity for growth given the fu
ture the truth be
joining john
bontecou be every bit as certain as
death and tax

death and tax

yes

death and tax

yes

what an odd pair

it be just a say mr
black

of whom

it do not matter

then why do you bring it up

you be not familiar with the phrase
in this world nothing be certain
but death and tax

i be now

glad i could be of some help

shall we adjourn

but the matter still on the table
bill

why do not we let it rest for the
moment

i know you be all as uncomfor
table as i be to be meeting without

still interest he be sweeten
he offer
although it pain i to say it in
i opinion bill parrish deal with
we peremptorily in dismiss any
deal with bontecou
therefore i be
sorry to say that if we be to exam
ine this new offer responsibly as
the board of director of parrish
communication we must do so with
out it chairman
oh yes there be one additional
element
bontecou be so anxious to
get we he said he would take parrish
communication with we chairman or
without

it be no surprise if i suggest to you
that the bill parrish we know be not
the bill parrish you see yesterday
you hear that speech some strange
emotional rationale to buttress a
kneejerk rejection of a legitimate
offer
do it not strike you that
something be possibly affecting this
mane judgement
more specifically
he judgement to make a critical
business decision

it be not pleasant to say the follow
ing but i would be remiss in this
crisis if i do not
when we pre
send bill with the improve bontecou
offer and if he refuse to let we
consider it once more make an
adamant or emotional rejection we
will have no choice but to seek an
alternative

and what would that be

bill birthday be the day after
tomorrow

yes the member be waiting
they
be in the board room now

good morning

do you want to have a cup of coffee
or something bill

i do not think so
do you

to get to the point we have re
ceived new information from john
bontecou concerning he desire for
this company to merge with he and
we wanted to set the detail before
you

that be it

bontecou want a quick response
and

the answer be no quick enough for
you

do not you want to hear the detail

i be not interest in the detail
and i be not interest in the big
picture either
what i be inter
ersted in be how i board get conven
ed behind i back be entertaining a
far proposal from a man whom it
offend i to do business with
moreover have the audacity to present
this to i like a prize fish and i
be expected to clap for it like a
performing seal
no thank you

so i be to understand from you re
sponse that you do not want to hear
the detail of Bontecous offer

yes you be to understand that and
now may i ask you a question

certainly bill

be you running this board or be i

we be not get anywhere here
why do not we take some of the good
out of this thing let we consider
it coolly let we take a week

bontecou want a speedy response
than that

he will wait

do not need to
today tomorrow
a week from now a week from
now who can think about a week
from now the answer be going to
be the same a loud unmistakable

ing you decision in regard to this

for anything because i have never
wanted anything before if you can
understand

how perfect for you to take
whatever you want because it
please you
it be not love

then what be it

some aimless infatuation in which
for the moment you feel like in
dulging
it be missing everything
that matter

which be what

trust responsibility taking the
weight for you choice and feel
ing and spending the rest of you
life living up to they
and above
all not hurting the object of you
love

so that be what love be

multiply it by infinity and take it
to the death of forever and you will
still have barely a glimpse of what
i be talking about

those be i word bill

breaking it the bottom line be
joe you be conducting a great
romance under false pretenses

i do not expect you to

be you threatening i

i certainly hope so i loved susan
from the moment she be born and i
love she now and every minute in
between and what i dream of be a
man who will discover she and she
will discover a man who will love
she who be worthy of she who be of
this world of this time and have the
grace and compassion and fortitude
to walk beside she as she make she
way through this beautiful thing
call life
