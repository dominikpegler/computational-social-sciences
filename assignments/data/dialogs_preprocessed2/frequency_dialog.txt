get the case file
we know what he be
going to do before he do it

so what should i do
call the police
you think they will believe i

they will if they catch he in the act
you can make that happen dad
you can
tail the victim and call it in at just
the right moment

i do not know john
i be a fire fighter
this be
this be different

i do know
i be a cop
this be what i
do

you ever talk to a victim family
the
one left behind
they do not act like
what you would think
there be panic and
fear
but mostly it be like there be this
logic problem
and if they could only
solve it everything would be okay
but if you look real close look at
they eye you can see it
just a
glimmer
but somewhere they know
they
know they world be never going to be the
same

what if the radio stop working
christ
what if i can not reach you again

then you get mom the hell out
but dad
those other woman be not suppose to
die
we do not try to stop this guy

of we live

six
Showd up at Cozys bar around six
thirty
she walk outta that bar around
seventhirty

empty lot behind the place at eight
of the clock

why not just get the cop to watch the
bar

whatever they tell
she could change what happen
no i want you to follow she
see if
