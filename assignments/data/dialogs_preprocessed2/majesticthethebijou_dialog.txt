at that time
it mean a lot to the folk around
here to be able to come to the
picture

yeah i know but poultry

i know it be hard to believe son
but this place this little place
this be not a theater then this

any man woman
child you i it do not matter
you buy you ticket and you
walk in and you

you be in a palace
it be
like a dream
it be like heaven
like you die and go to a palace

maybe it be just an escape
from reality but

you want to sit at home and watch a
little box with a little screen
because it be convenient

motion carry nine to two one
abstention

the presence of just about anyone
who ever find they way into one
of these meeting
Gmoring
folk

not a sudden interest in lawson
politics that bring you all here

well no
i wanted to thank you all for
giving i such a nice welcome and
making i feel at home
but i
we be
actually here on business
of a sort

point of order mr
mayor this
come under the head new
business and this be not the
time

i think we can make an exception
here daley

it will need to be moved and
second

all right motion to hear the
speaker out of order

second

motion on the floor discussion
open discussion closed all those
in favor signify by saying aye


aye

oppose

the motion be carry

go ahead son

and sweet
the bijou need a lot
of repair and the truth of the
matter be harry um that be dad

bit and see if you have anything
that might help we out

what kind of thing be you
talking about

oh paint brush plaster light
bulb yardage and if you can not
come up with any of that we can
use some oldfashion elbow
grease

so
you do intend to fix the
place up after all

mr
fitt with all due respect i
think lawson need the bijou a bit
more than it need a super market
and i think lawson deserve the
bijou

be do to help we get past the
pain we have all feel

start

of lawson to help out the bijou in
any way they can

short of the allocation of city
fund

while to get used to calling you

pete
pete
it be a nice name

thanks i like it
i think

Delly i want to do the right
thing

i believe you

the truth be i be a lot of thing
but communist be not one of they

but if you only go to one
meeting why do anyone care
besides why should it even matter
if you be a communist

come on Delly look at the country
today
we be fighting communist
in korea we be paranoid about the
russian we have get this thing with
the rosenbergs and the atomic
bomb
you think they want suspect
communist entertaining the
american public with party
propaganda like gosh i do not know
sand pirate of the sahara


forget about all that
you want to
do the right thing
then defend
you name
if someone say
something about you that be untrue
you have to stand up and say so
i
know the law and the law on
you side

what about you Delly

i be too

you will stand by i

whatever happen


whatsit girl

shhhhh
i know lottie
this
time i think it be the martian
for sure


i be here with mabel lanier the
owner of the diner here on commerce
street where appleton often take
meal
mrs
lanier tell i what
be you thought about have such
a celebrate suspect communist in
you midst all this time

well it kind hard to believe
because luke i mean peter be
such a
i mean since he be be
back i have never see the town so
happy and all
it be like he give
we some
i do not know
some
hope i guess

what she be refer to folk be
yet another bizarre twist in this
story
not only be appleton alive
but he be be suffering from
amnesia and living here in lawson
where due to a startle
resemblance everyone in town for
the last three month have taken he
for one of Lawsons dead war
hero albert trumbo

luke
we always called he luke


the can not arrest you because
you have not do anything wrong

well that be a relief
i
understand they usually do not let
that stop they

however
you be going to be
subpoena to testify before the
unamerican activity committee
when they open hearing in los
angeles
now if you play ball and
tell they what they want to hear
they will clear you

and i will not be a communist anymore

exactly

so it do not make any difference
that i be not one now and have
never be one

kid do not get philosophical with
i
this be a game but it be not
you game
you play by they
rule or they will ruin you
and
they have the power to do it

do not it bother anyone that this
be a perversion of democracy

darling do not kid yourself
we
do not have a democracy in this
country
the declaration of
independence
the constitution
these be piece of paper with
signature on they
and you know
what a piece of paper with a
signature be
it be a contract
and you know what a contract be
something that can be renegotiate
at any time
it just so happen
that the house unamerican
activity committee be re
negotiating the contract this time
around

next time it might be the
the time after that it might be
the president
but it will always be
someone
count on it

that be not the country luke fight
for

lest we forget peter you own
military career be somewhat less
illustrious than lukes

it be wrong leo

peter do not let that stop you all
of a sudden

here
when you be called read
this to they
just tell the
bastard what they want to hear
and we can all get on with we
live

for

mr
chairman the witness be be
nonresponsive

i know that a lot of good honest
decent people people that i

and what i be but because of what
you say i be
i know that i

mr

the question of this committee
without elaboration or
speechmaking or the chair will
find you in contempt of congress

a member of the communist party

no sir

be you refute this evidence and
you previous testimony

i be not refute anything

yet you be contradict yourself
you early testify that you
attend a meet of a communist
partyrun organization yet you
just said under oath that you
be not now nor ever a
member of the communist party

i go to the meet but i
do not go as a member

before you at this time but i be
sure mr

prepare and if you would like to
either answer they or plead the
fifth amendment we can at least
get on with the business of this
committee

tell they pete
tell they

mr

the fifth amendment pertain to
selfincrimination and i can not

amendment

congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof
or abridge the
freedom of speech or of the press
or the right of the people

petition the government for a
redress of grievance


that be the first amendment mr

it be the backbone of
this nation
it be everything that
give we the potential to be right
and good and just if only we would
live up to that potential
it be
what give i the right to sit in
this chair and say i piece before
this committee without fear
it be
the most important part of the
contract that every citizen have
with this country
and even though
this contract
the constitution and the bill
of right even though they be
just piece of paper with
signature on they they be the
only contract we have that be
most definitely not subject to
renegotiation
not by you mr
