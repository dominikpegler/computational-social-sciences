the american people be looking for a

delegate of this convention in much the
way johnson helped kennedy in

small cramp space overflow with book unopened box
from amazon
com and barnes and noble

raymond stare at she

after all you be young and you have
plenty of party convention ahead of you
in which to discover as you father do
that democracy be an elusive and
imperfect science and the meek do not
happily inherit the earth but simply get
eat by the alpha dog chewed up
digest and deposit on the carefully
mown parkway of american politics
raymond roll he eye
she ruffle he hair again head

bullied agenda buy and sold and
with apology to i mother i wish to
remain an amateur
i believe democracy
be not negotiable
we need to secure
tomorrow today
ellie shake she head fondly and begin to move away as


with ellie and gillespie and he two aide and a
posse of three other through
a hallway crowded with
member and a complete
in redwhiteandblue sequine leotard as

bluffing

that be the inference
Raymonds speech echo incoherently through the corridor

they should be down on they fat white
knee thank i for saving this party
from commit political seppuku


you give they every opportunity to do the
right thing senator

no
i give they one opportunity
and
that be unusually generous of i
she push through a door and into


Raymonds speech play low on a television and half a
dozen and with arthur for
president button grimly watch ellie breeze in
party
chairman anticipate she

the decision be final senator

smile

before we get start i be dying to know
which genius here hatch the scheme of
pair a sound bite from nebraska with a
relic who think keeping suicide bomber
off we buss be unconstitutional

all the research indicate that an arthur
jordan ticket sit quite well with the
american public and

sit quite well translate into how
many vote

you son be largely unknown outside of
new york
he public service he
congressional record while commendable

i son be a war hero

governor arthur have agreed to consider
raymond for a cabinet post
cold silence
ellie stand


we do not come here to have a discussion

senator
do we come here to have a
discussion

ellie you do not have the vote to block
this or even push the nomination to a
second ballot

even running against this cutandfold
vice president with he party record
of abysmal failure at home and abroad
arthur be still unelectable without help
cold hard logic

consider
the governor be a cornbelt
candidate who scratch and sniff
look and smell alot like the kind of
liberallaborintellectual dukakis be
but without thank god the helmet
assume we intrepid arthur can carry the
northeast plus he home ground and
california
we be still dead in the
south and southwest where they win by
landslide
the midcentral be a toss
up
tom jordan actually become a
liability in florida because of he
Castroappeasement profile and in the
carolinas where he fumble the military
vote over he terrorism be not a war it be
a social disease nonsense
the room be surreally silent
ellie spin and move like a
televangelist preaching to the frighten faithful

you know this
you own poll and
survey back i up
you be counting on jordan to help you get
the black vote woman college kid i
gut instinct say he will not and arthur
holding the center where he be soft at
best
and who be to say the president
will not throw troop into another third
world skirmish pushing he sidekick
approval rating up into the eighties
again and the campaign off the front
page


we be confident this be a win ticket
ellie

what be you margin of error
five
point
three
i can swing that and you know it
i can
swing seven away from you more than
enough to split the party and

and deny we the white house for four
more year
no
not even you would do
that senator
you be bluffing
ellie stare at they

the marching band
begin playing it be a grand old flag and hurry out onto
the convention floor

america be facing the great test of
it history gentleman
not just from
terrorist organization both outside and
within we border but from covert
alliance of disaffected nation so
terrify of winding up on we shit list
they believe the only way to protect
themselves be to hit we with everything
they can find before we get around to
they
be i the only one in this room
paying attention to the report
we
be on the brink of nuclear cataclysm on
we own soil while we policy remain
shackle by Jordanstyle one Worlders who
insist that human being be essentially
good
and that power be something
shameful and evil
make no mistake the people of this great
country be frighten
they know what be
coming
they can feel it
and we can
shovel they the same old shit and call it
sugar or arm they with a young
vibrant populist congressman a war hero
with heart forged by enemy fire in
the desert in the dark when american
live hung in the balance


one of Ellies backroom adversary at the microphone as
balloon fall and the crowd


proud to offer into nomination the
name of the next vice president of these
united states
happy bedlam

those of you with tie to the
intelligence community may recall the
cias misguided program the
KGBs Novichok research and similar half
assed venture in great britain and china
under the lie term of mind control



the bedouin woman begin to make a spooky trill sound
they as the mysterious woman voice start to
into a

Streetcorner schizophrenic with tin
foil on they head offer sad proof of
the failure of those endeavor
she smile creepy put a hand on Raymonds shoulder



i can assure you this be a whole new
ball game


be here too he head wrapped in a bandage he be
wearing hospital green
be rig to his
head chest arm and leg like some
all coiling up into the shadow of the high ceiling into
thick cable and tube beneath which robotic

drugged to the gill jerking with spasm as low voltage

undertake
all rig up with he wire

i will recommend sergeant shaw for the

Hyperdelusional that they have be

reality overlap



we candidate course of treatment will
of course involve considerably more
sophisticated intervention over a
sustain time period to ensure that a
stable mechanism be irrevocably in place
we employ a kind of neurocellular
conversion
psychological abreaction
through genomic repurposing
but dr
Noyle all the literature all
the literature say you cannot make an
individual act against he deep moral
nature or he own self interest

what a thought

life be so bizarre be not it

persona sometimes occasionally for
an instant the fog clear and i look and
i think what be i do
i mean what
the fuck be i do
pose and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet shaking hand
with total stranger who must be blind if


they can not see what i be at the core
what i mother have make i
raymond look steadily at marco
who nod interest

prentiss
ferociously a prentiss
but not a shaw god forbid i be
mold by cold hard hand every detail

can you
even imagine ben how it would feel
never to have a say in what you life
would be
i be twenty year old before
i have a friend no bad a girlfriend
well almost but yes a friend or
i think so outside i mother
circle of approve encounter and it
do not she would not precipitate
i one act of rebellion storming off and
enlist
in the army
which ironically only
serve ultimately to pad i gild
prentiss resume
you know
fluent in
five language phi beta kappa
congressional medal of honor blah blah
blah

and after the war i come back to she
and the family legacy
this

prentiss destiny

and impossibly fast across whitecapped
azure water toward crumbled ruin of a longabandoned
village on an empty beach we remember it vividly from
marcos memory arriving to slowly and hover over the
remnant of an ancient caravansary


on marco moving across the intricate sun
bleach tile work we remember from Noyles lab

dissipated trace of a scaffolding superstructure inside
crumble ruin

you do not develop a technology like that
and waste it on two guy
he look to rosie who stand in an archway
there be
here with weapon could be here to guard marco
could be here to protect he

we know that
marco look past she to the water which stretch out from
here as if to forever

i remember running
he arm be in a simple sling
he move like a man who be
be shoot and not quite recovered move past rosie out
of the brokendown ruin

i have to get out where the sky be
rosie motion the soldier to stay back follow he by
herself

i have to get to the water
as they walk down the beach to the sea
few
tumbledown building be all that remain of an ancient
seaside town

i think
if i can just get to the
water everything will be okay
marco approach the water edge stare out at the
uncertain horizon
nothing but water as far as the eye can see

and back
and back
