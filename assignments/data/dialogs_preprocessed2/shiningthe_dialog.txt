forward to the hotel i bet


i be not mrs
torrance


oh come on tony
do not be silly



i do not want to go there mrs
torrance


well how come you do not want to go


i just do not


well let we just wait and see
we be all going to have a real good
time


bill i would like you to meet jack
torrance

how do you do

bill how do you do

pleased to meet you

pleasure to meet you

grab a chair bill and join in


jack be going to take care of the
overlook for this winter
i would
like you to take he around the
place as soon as we be through

fine

jack be a schoolteacher


eh formerly a schoolteacher

what line of work be you in now

i be a writer um
teaching have
be more or less a way of making
end meet


well this ought to be quite a
change for you


well i be looking for a change

we people in denver recommended
jack very highly and for once i
agree with they



let we see where be we
yes
i
be about to explain that eh
we
season here run from oh may th
to october th and then we close
down completely until the follow
may


do you mind if i ask why you do
that
it seem to i that the
ski up here would be fantastic

oh it sure would be


but the problem be the enormous
cost it would be to keep the road
to the sidewinder open
it be a
it be a mile stretch of road
get an average of foot of snow
during the winter and there be just
no way to make it economically
feasible to keep it clear
when
the place be build in there
be very little interest in winter
sport and this site be chosen
for it seclusion and scenic beauty


well it be certainly get plenty of
that

that be right
and do they give
you any idea in denver about what
the job entail


only in a very general way

well


the winter can be fantastically
cruel and the basic idea be
to
to cope with the very costly
damage and depreciation which can
occur
and this consist mainly of
running the boiler heat
different part of the hotel on a
daily rotate basis repair
damage as it occur and doing
repair so that the element can not
get a foothold


well that sound fine to i


physically it be not a very
demanding job
the only thing that
can get a bit trying up here during
the winter be eh
the tremendous
sense of isolation


well that just happen to be
exactly what i be looking for
i be
eh
i be outline a new write
project and eh


five month of peace be just what i
want


that be very good jack because eh
for some people eh solitude and
isolation


can of itself be a problem

not for i


how about you wife and son
how
do you think they will take to it


they will love it

great


well before i turn you over to
bill there be one other thing i
think we should talk about
i
do not want to sound melodramatic
but it be something that be


be known to give a few people
second thought about the job


i be intrigue


i do not suppose they eh told you
anything in denver about the
tragedy we have up here during the
winter of


i do not believe they do


well i predecessor in this job


hired a man named charles grady as
the winter caretaker
he come up
here with he wife and two little
girl of about eight or ten
and
he have a good employment record
good reference and from what i have
be tell i mean he seem like a
completely normal individual
but
at some point during the winter he
must have suffer some kind of a
complete mental breakdown


he run amok and eh
killed his
family with an axe


stacked they neatly in one of the
room in the west wing and then he
um
then he put eh both barrel
of he shotgun in he mouth


the police eh
they think that
it be what the oldtimers used to
call cabinfever a kind of
claustrophobic reaction which can
occur when people be


shut in together over long period
of time

well that be eh quite a story


yes it be
oh it be still hard
for i to believe that it actually
happen here but it do and eh
i think you can appreciate why i
wanted to tell you about it



ah i certainly can and eh
i
also understand why you people in
denver left it for you to tell i


well obviously some people can be


put off by the idea of staying
alone in a place where something
like that actually happen

well you can rest assure mr
ullman that be not going to happen
with i and eg as far as i wife
be concern i be sure she will be
absolutely fascinated when i tell
she about it
she be a confirm
ghost story and horror film addict


tony do you think daddy will get
the job

yeah he do
he be going to phone
wendy up in a few minute to tell
she

mrs
torrance i do not think you

i be
quite sure there be nothing
physically wrong with danny


oh yeah
oh yeah he seem
absolutely fine now but you should
have see he


oh i know
kid can scare you to
death but believe i these episode
be not at all uncommon and they
look much bad than they be


but eh what be the matter with he

mrs
torrance most of the time
these episode with kid be never
explain
they be bring on by
emotional factor and they rarely
occur again



they be more akin to autohypnosis
a kind of self induced trance
if
it reoccurs which i doubt


you can always think about have
some test do

no thank you

oh i be
i be sure you be right


have you be in boulder long mrs
torrance


only about three month
eh we be
from vermont
i husband be
teach school there


do the appearance of Dannys
imaginary friend



tony

do Tonys first appearance happen
to coincide with you arrival here


no um let we see i guess danny
start talkin to tony about the
time we put he into nursery school


do he adjust well to school


no
he do not like it too much at
first and then he have an injury
so we keep he out for a while
and yeah i
i guess that be about
the time when i first notice that
he be talking to tony


what sort of injury do he have


ah he dislocate he shoulder


how do he manage to do that

well it be just one of those thing
you know
purely an accident um
i husband have oh
be drink
and he come home about three hour
late so he be not exactly in the
great mood that night
and well
danny have scattered some of his
school paper all over the room
and i husband grab he arm you
know and pulled he away from they
it be
it be just the sort of thing
you do a hundred time with a
child you know in a park or on
the street but on this particular
occasion i husband just
used
too much strength and he injured
Dannys arm


anyway something good do come out
of it all because he said

this before
be all of these
indian design authentic

mainly on navajo and apache motif

oh well they be really gorgeous
as a matter of fact this be probably
the most gorgeous hotel i have ever
see

oh this old place have have an
illustrious past
in it heyday it
be one of the stop place for
the jet set


even before anybody know what a jet
set be
we have have four president
who stay here lots of movie star

royalty

all the good people







this be the staff wing of the hotel
none of the other bedroom be
heated during the winter

oh


goodbye mr
ullman

goodbye girl

and here be you quarter


live room bedroom bathroom and
a small bedroom for you son

perfect for a child

yeah

yes

well the place be very nicely self
contained easy to keep

cosy

homely

yeah


this be we famous hedge maze
it be quite an attraction around
here
the wall be thirteen foot
high and the hedge be about as
old as the hotel itself
it be a
lot of fun

have an hour to spare to find i way
out

when be the overlook build


ah
construction start in
it be finished in
the site

indian burial ground and i believe
they actually have to repel a few
indian attack as they be building
it


that be we Snowcat
can you both
drive a car

yes

that be fine because basically the
Snowcat operate very much like a

too well here unless you have bring
you own supply

remove all the booze from the
premise when we shut down

and for a long time i think it
be just the two of we that have the
shine to we


just like you probably think you
be the only one
but there be
other folk though mostly they
do not know it or do not believe it



how long have you be able to do it



why do not you want to talk about it


i be not suppose to


who say you be not suppose to


tony

Tonys the little boy who life in
i mouth


be tony the one that tell you

mr
halloran be you scare of
this place


no i be scare of nothing here
it be just that you know some place

the overlook hotel here have
something about it that be like
shine

be there something bad here



well you know doc when something
happen it can leave a trace of
itself behind
say like be
someone burn toast


well maybe thing that happen
leave other kind of trace behind


not thing that anyone can notice
but thing that people who shine
can see
just like they can see
thing that have not happen yet
