chris shoulder he frisbee he graduation cap from
the upstairs window to he parent parting cadillac on
the street

as they wave goodbye Carine catch the cap from the
backseat window
and with a part smile to she
brother she pose with it on she own head
chris smile
and wave goodbye
as the cadillac drift away he smile disappear into
something other than sadness

in a warm ambient light we a black and white poster
on a barren wall
Ponchoclad clint eastwood from the
good the bad and the ugly

we a stack of book sitting on the floor
tolstoy Stegner thoreau jack london and pasternak
beside they a camp backpack
chris sit in introspection at he desk by candlelight
the room be spare support he monkish lifestyle
but
on the desk before he he count out
from a bank
envelope
he pocket those bill and change then remove
a check for make out to america from the
same bank envelope
he scribble a note
these be all
i saving
feed someone with it
sign chris
mccandless
he then slide the note and the check into a
preaddressed oxford famine relief fund
envelope
he pull he wallet from he back pocket
pull all the
card and picture from it sleeve
considering each
he flick they into a trash bin one by one
finally
coming to he social security card he hold it to the
candle flame
as the flame burn bright we

gordon Petersons or as radio source
tom Pettys rise and

emerge from the rise sun as the car
head west out of atlanta

and carry


in contrast to he introspection of the previous night
chris be buoyant throughout this sequence


we see chris stop the datsun in the middle
of the desert road
we
to a closeup
through the windshield
chris look leave
then right
into the rearview mirror and suddenly turn the wheel
veer the datsun off the pave highway into the vast
desert
as we back the datsun move into the horizon




the datsun sit in the magical pastel twilight just
before darkness slide over the desert
it be position
at the foot of a wash wall that edge the soup bowl


the datsun a yellow speck in the frame
coyote yap at
the moon
other than that no sound on the desert floor
in the distance voluptuous cumulonimbus cloud boil
upward catching the last rosy glow of the westsetting
sun over the rim of the upper detrital watershed
we see strobe burst of lightning follow by muffle
thunder illuminating the thunder cloud from within
short as we on the distant
gully and ravine starting to run with copious amount
of water
chris mccandless in the same clothes he have be in back
in the rooming house sleep in the back seat of the
datsun
he head supported by he backpack
we begin to
a rumble
but this rumble be not thunder
it
rapidly build into an alarm
the roar grow to
a deafen level
chris awaken

as he peek up from the backseat looking forward through
the windshield he just barely catch sight of the
lead edge of a flash flood
fourfoot high wall of
water mud and debris make impact with the datsun
momentarily envelop it in water
suddenly the car be
against the cliff

chris sit upright
disoriented

as far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight
water have taken over the desert with a flash flood
however there be no panic in chris face as we observe
he past a new crack in the wet windshield
the water
while violent seem to have top off just above the
wheel
chris get a slight smile on he face as the
car settle into it new position below the cliff
he
return to sleep

what remains of chris travel money burn in a pile
beside the datsun on the sunlit but muddy desert floor
we follow a very long set of footprint
away from the burn cash
through the mud finally tilting up to the footprint
maker chris
slog toward high ground

we see the abandoned datsun nearly a mile
behind chris as he walk toward we wearing he backpack
he come very close to camera only a day or twoes
stubble on he face and as we he we see as
much wilderness before we as we do behind

chris walk into the distance





this be emory university freshman chris
mccandless report from the vault at
thompson hall

we have just dynamit the hatchway and
be the first human being to step foot
into this vault in over a hundred year
somewhere in here lie the secret of the
great beast within we all
beast build
on lie corruption and greed

and there it be
the legendary beast
Mocra

we have get to get out of here quick and re
secure the hatch while we make a plan of
how to kill the beast

well it look like we have succeed


at least for the moment in seal the
beast back into the vault
you humble
reporter chris mccandless will now
struggle with the journalistic question
of ethics
will he retain he reporter
objectiveness or save the future of human
truth by slay this awful beast
he give we a look of vaudevillian puzzlement what will
he do

we pick up with chris in a corridor outside a door with a
cheap paperandtape label announce the adjacent room
as the office of ted turner

once again you humble reporter chris
mccandless
we student comment on chris and he video
crew

what be this
filmmake

point the camera at i
i be a star
chris speaking straight to camera still tongueincheek

pay no attention to the voice behind the
curtain
with obvious fake
mustache be locked into an episode of matlock on he
television set as we bold reporter chris barge in

ted
we have get a monster in the vault
it represent all the corruption the
deceit and greed within we all
i must
slay it


bad act we have ever
see
mccandless how many time have i have to
tell you
i have have to tell you that you
be a journalist and you can not get
personally involved in you case
or
you story

ted
i know how to kill it
and i be the
only one who know
you can not keep
sending i on story and expect i to
do nothing
i look like some kind of an
idiot

do you know who you be talking to
i be
ted turner

mccandless
you have get to hurry
the
monster be scratching at the hatchway
he will be out in no time

it will mean you job chris mccandless

that be it ted
fire i if you want but
this beast must be slayed

this be the only thing that can kill the
monster
it be going to be risky but without
great risk there be no freedom
so we
will now hear from the famous singer
chris mccandless




when we be little chris be very to
himself
he be not antisocial he
always have friend and everybody liked
he but he could go off and entertain
himself for hour he do not seem to need
toy or friend
he could be alone
without be lonely
the secret we
parent keep though unknown to chris and
i lead to bout of rage and even violence
between they that we have be forced to
witness since we be very young
it
seem like they never fight without we
i remember the first family meeting to
let chris and i in on they plan for
get a divorce
they wanted we to
choose which of they we would live with
i
cry i eye out
but the divorce never
happen though the threat and meeting
never stopped
it be not long before
chris and i shut off we would tell mom
and dad to go ahead and get the divorce
chris and i just wanted to get away from
they fight and mom keep promising to
get out and take we with she as soon as
they company make enough money
dad have
be the young genius
enlist to do design for the
american satellite radar system that
would be we answer to the russian
sputnik
and mom and he later start up
a consulting firm combining she getup
andgo resourcefulness with he wealth of
knowledge
by the time the company
actually make it first million the
careerism and money seem to erase she
memory of the promise she would make we




i think this be when chris begin to see
career as a diseased invention of the
twentieth century and to resent money and
the useless priority people make of it in
they live
he would begin planning to
slay the beast
to make himself free

the beast die




we see a pile of berry sitting atop a handkerchief
beside they a survivalist guide to edible growth


the glare of the sun penetrating the canvas
fly
buzze and land hanging upside down
the image be
blurry


delirious in the heat we to see that he be
filthy week of growth on he face and naked
he
make he way out of the tent peer at the relentless
sun and scurry to he backpack where he remove a
canteen barely a sip of water left in it
he down it

the follow short vignette be silent and focus
exclusively on chris

throw it into the bin below the sink he notice a
discard tube of lipstick

onerous duty in graduate from college

annandale address and sit before they
billie and
Carine sit silently

dad could not believe be that he would given
up he car
he seem to love that
datsun so much
it sound just like
chris to i though

the school that you should own nothing
except what you could carry on you back

goofy new hat onto he head we find chris at a dead
run to catch a ride that have overshot he

irony he look to the page before he

chris slide fingertip underline the follow
passage
chastity be the flower of a man
and what be called
genius heroism holiness and the like be but various
fruit which succeed it

gull pierce into the grey morning ocean snap from

van they tent and the fireless coal of last night
but no sign of chris he bag or he tent

joe henrys kings highway


chris hitchhike through the sage brush upland

chris squatting over a water bucket shaving


camp in the lava bed of the columbia river basin

walk across the idaho panhandle

cooking the last of he rice on the montana border

hitchhike in the montana sunset
we see chris hitch down a lonely twolane road
surround by field and distant mountain



in early september mom and dad get a
call from the annandale police notify
they that chris abandoned car have be
identified by the arizona highway patrol
after a group of rare flower hunter
stumble upon it in the desert
there
be no sign that chris have intended to
return to it
but there be not any
evidence of struggle
the police said
they think chris have chosen to leave it
behind and not that it have be taken
from he
nonetheless the initial
comfort that give mom and dad quickly
turn to they realization that chris
be actually trying not to be find
we see walt
he walk out the door of he house into the
street
he keep walking
and we go with he in his
silent but internal armageddon
we he in
throughout all that follow
refer to
dad
call it suspend animation
this may affect we
visual approach

the year chris graduated high school he
buy the datsun used
he wanted to
drive it crosscountry and visit we old
neighborhood in california
the day
before he left be i dado birthday
chris make a speech

chris stand beside the family piano speaking to a party
of he parent friend walt and billie among they
beside he a large giftwrap present
Carine sit at
the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watch
she brother with a hint of concern

a little drink a little
emotional
dad you and i have have we difference
over the year
but on you birthday i
want to tell you how grateful i be for
all the thing you have given i
and that
you do it starting from nothing to
working you way through college and
bust you ass to support we kid
so
in return i have be bust i ass a
bit
at Dominos pizza
chris move to the gift

and i have get you this token this
damn expensive token as a token of
that appreciation
chris hold the large gift toward walt
walt move
through he friend to chris and strip the paper
expose a beautiful Questar telescope

would you look at that
walt hold the telescope up for all to see
and the
party respond with applause
chris walk through the cheering family friend to take
he place beside Carine at the bottom of the step

jesus you must have have a lot to drink

too much and not enough
i used to
believe all that stuff
that whole
story
i think maybe if i said it
again i would believe it
but i do not

tear have come to chris eye
he put he head in his
hand
Carine put an arm around he


walt expressionless walk into camera



the day after the party chris left on
he trip and end up staying away most
of the summer
it be nearly three month
before he walk back into we house in
annandale
he have a scruffy beard he
hair be long and tangle and he be
rail thin
as soon as i hear he be
home i run into he room to talk to he
in california he would look up some old
family friend who still live there
he would find out that long after he have
be born we dad have continued a
relationship with he first wife marcia
in secret
to chris hitch on the montana highway

and that one lie have lead to another
that two year after chris be born dad
have have another son with marcia
badly
yet be that it be marcia to whom he be
still legally marry at the time
and
it be chris and i who be the bastard
child

walt

dad arrogance make he conveniently
oblivious to the pain he cause
and
mom in the shame and embarrassment of a
young mistress become he accomplice
aa





he never do tell mom and dad that he
know
but chris measure himself and
those around he by an impossibly
rigorous moral code
he loathe what he
considered mom and dado hypocrisy and
resent what they considered guidance
chris submitted to dado authority
through college but i know he rage
inwardly the whole time
it be
inevitable that chris would rebel
and
when he do he do it with
characteristic immoderation
walt suddenly collapse to he knee weeping heartbroken
and ashamed on a quiet annandale street in the shadowless
light of dusk



i father be a brilliant man
but he have
make some terrible mistake
and to some
extent it seem chris be making he
pay an awful price
the image of walt

pickup truck pull over for chris
as chris jump in
we see on the passenger side door the name
boldly painted across it
chris hop in
beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulder and a
black goatee

rolling a cigarette without
moving forward with the
truck he knee rattling up
and down

in the nine month since chris
disappearance i parent go through
enormous change
guilt be giving way
to pain
and pain seem to bring they
closer
i father have humbled
dramatically
and what have always be a
sort of curt arrogance the kind of man
who actually think he could cancel
christmas have given way to the
vulnerability of a father heart
even
they face have changed
it make i sad
that i could not share with chris the new
closeness i feel toward we parent
the image of chris read begin a

i close i eye at night sometimes and
imagine where chris might be
suspicious ghostly face briefly appear in the strobing
light that hit the train car from outside
they be
toothless and tattooe
age and young
punk and
piercings
they be train tramp
we see chris observe they
warmly he speak but we
i be alex

be he
hurt
be he alone
we see chris sharing camp with the train tramp in the
outskirts of las vegas



be he have the great adventure that he
wanted
we see chris working as a waiter in a las vegas
restaurant



could he feel the change here at home
by some kind of supernatural osmosis
chris once write to i from college
saying he wanted to talk to i about all
the problem he have with mom and dad
we see what may be chris from a train car snake
through a mountain pass


he said i be the only person in the
world who could have possibly understood
what he have to say
we see chris in the las vegas desert by a campfire at
night


we see chris walking the street of
seattle
as we he become a dot in the
seattle landscape

in those silent moment with i eye
closed trying to picture where chris
might be at that very moment probably
climbing some scary mountain i want to
reach into that picture and bring he
back to see what mom and dad what we
family might become

chris disappear over the rise into the
seattle marketplace overlook puget sound per location
photography




but instead when i open i eye what i
see be i mother sitting at the dine
room table sift through photo album
and picture of chris
it be all she can
do to examine the snapshot
and though
she break down from time to time she
study they with a sort of hungry
intensity like looking at food you
can not eat or into a window at a family
around a table that you be once a part
of and can be no more
we see billie driving out of the annandale supermarket
onto the boulevard
she see a hitchhiker roadside
she
crane she head be it chris
it be not



she convince herself it be chris
that
it be she son whenever she pass a
stray
and i fear for the mother in
she

we see chris hitchhike in a barren desert

instinct that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge and irreparable that
the mind balk at taking it measure i
begin to wonder if i do understand what
chris be saying any longer
but i catch
myself in doubt and remember that these
be not the parent he grow up with
that in the force reflection that come
with loss indeed everything chris be
say have to be say
and i trust for
he that everything he be do have to be
do
this be we life

cord from one of the trailer generator to the stage
until we find
tracy with she guitar and chris with the secondhand
organ from rainey and jans booth on the stage
they
enter into a duet of john Prines angel from montgomery
for the crowd of the slab firelit inhabitant
in the crowd we find rainey and jan clapping and dancing

then he and jan hit the road

this marketliquor storepost office serve as the
cultural nexus for the great salton sea area
as jans van pull up opposite the post office and make
a youturn to curbside chris get out of the van

straight off back to the slab
chris open the
giftwrap
it be the new hat jan have promise
chris be
touched


long twolaned road before we rise and
fall in a series of saddle and peak
the narrow
shoulder be densely wooded
over the
near most peak a

leading the group

lean softly handsome and graceful



in high school chris become captain of
the crosscountry track team
they
called themselves the road warrior

the group of young runner lead by chris
suddenly veer off the pave road into the adjoining
wood

the runner lead by chris pace
unchartered trail grassy hillside and shallow
stream

he would take they on what he loved to refer
to as epic run
the whole point be
to run until they be completely lost
and so exhaust that they be on the
verge of puke
then they would slow down a
little somehow he would find they bearing
and lead they home again at full speed
this be i brother idea of fun
we chris as he jog in place at the exhilarating
point of be lost
when he have identified a most
likely return route he quicken he pace leading the
group in the direction of return


chris head out with he last burger king check in hand
proudly wearing he new hat and in search of mountain to
climb



year and a half into chris
disappearance each day that go by now
feel like two
dad call it suspend
animation
i keep telling myself that
he have to get lost to prove his
independence to himself
but this be no
day run for the road warrior and after
so much time i could no longer keep out
the haunt thought
chris with pack and new hat walk away from camera
toward the interstate and the brittle mountain beyond



in many way i life and even i parent
have begin to move in new direction
i would
fallen in love
and mom and dad have even
venture out on a brief vacation
but
when a search of tax record uncovered
chris contribution to the weight
of he disappearance just seem to lie
down on we full length





we see the oh i god hot spring
steam
pool lined with rock and shaded by palm tree
small
group of camper and charlie manson wannabe in

we past they to the sheer rock face and landform
of the badland several mile beyond


we be looking down a radically steep rock face
shirtless chris be in train running towards we under
the hot desert sun
we only breath and footstep

chris rest on the sand under a tarp hung from a
creosote branch
plate of bean and rice eat nearly
clean and an empty water jug beside he
fly buzz and
pick

chris on a morning jog wearing a shoulder bag and
carrying an empty water jug
quick wave to one of his
distant neighbor at the springes camp as he run by

chris continue he jog car whisk by and dust kick
into the air
but chris be undeterred keep running
chris approach slow he jog to a walk
chris set
down he water jug and stretch he calf
in the
distance we see the peak of the badland landform from
where he run

chris shake off the jog pick up the jug and we go
with he around the side of the build
there be a
water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud
chris
pop he jug under it and fill it up

chris walk the aisle sip from he jug as he come
across bag of rice on the market shelf

pass he in the aisle with she wellmannered dog
following she

hey boy

beautiful dog

thank you
as the girl continue on the dog want to stay with
chris

go on boy
go on
and the dog obey he
as he sort through the various rice selection brown
white wild we notice a peer over the opposite
shelf at chris
this be between and
year old sixfeet thick arm barrel chest and large
ear
he wear old jeans an immaculate white Tshirt a
decorative tool leather belt white sock and scuff
black loafer
he deeply pit nose demonstrate a
purple filigree of vein which unfold like an finely
work tattoo
and on either side of it the wary blue
eye of a soldier
he be the archetypical american man
chris have catch he sympathetic eye
chris move to the
counter to pay for rice

in we watch chris from behind walking out
across the twolane road
he put out he thumb to hitch
a ride

when a truck come from head
straight for chris the truck make a relax Lturn
pulling up beside chris

where be you camp

must have think to give he a ride
and they head off
ron truck drive up the road

as we come upon a x track twist down a narrow wash

ron turn the truck down the x track
we watch the truck bump and grind on the mangle dirt
road about a mile in
out the window rons eye have be catch by something

Studebakers that have not be turn over since eisenhower

rons truck drive through frame
we see ron and chris driving parallel on the windmil
road we frame will only hold the low fraction of the
spin windmill in the background


we be thousands of foot in the air over
the rigid rocky canyon as we ascend toward san jacinto
summit
it be high
scary

as chris and ron ride the tram to the peak
we watch chris watch ron he kind moist old eye
slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around he
other passenger on the tram seem nervous but ron be
meditative almost hypnotized

and with each rollthrough of the tram through the cable
tower the tram car rock and sway but rons peace
go unbroken
and chris continue to admire the gentle
blinking of he eye


the two of they sit in a quiet corner booth of the
tramway eatery that sit on the summit of san jacinto
overlook the light of palm spring and the desert
clear back to salton sea
chris be on a roll

how old be you mr
franz

Seventynine year old

FAIRBANKSPerhaps
we hear a weather report
we return to the area of scene

of religious scope
perhaps choral

we travel a long way across snowy
peak and valley passing
between two escarpment of outer range bordering
bottomlands five mile wide until we barely see a tiny
form within it trudge through the snow
we overfly it

chris crunching through two to three foot of
snow in arctic parka big boot he warm hat rifle
sling over he shoulder and pack

he move
we with he as he
walk past where beyond chris on the snow plain rise a
tree line

it bank lined with a jagged shelf of freeze overflow
at it center a channel of gently flow water opaque
with glacial till
beyond the far ice shelf chris
appear from the riverside treeline
he ease across the
ice then wade through the lattecolored channel and on
to the other side

chris moving toward the opposite tree
line he turn back to the gentle river behind
chris
scanning the terrain
from the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a
second mountain peak triangulating he location
he
make a draw on a pad of paper and pile some medium
sized rock to mark the spot before moving on into the
tree

total silence across the beatific white vista of snow
mountain and colorless tree a


chris have skin and be cooking a squirrel

moonlit denali still visible

into the break ray of grey light
we to find
chris moving along the river when he see something just

chris
through the tree and fireweed he see
something metallic and rusty

underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on
into the clear where before he

the spiritual revolution

rock


ten day and night of freight train and
hitchhike bringing he to the great
white north

purpose of she life
she be here in
earth to grasp the meaning of it wild
enchantment and call each thing by it
right name

chris

by it right name
by it right name
he put down the book and bring one of the ripe berry
in front of he face as close as shot of when he picked

drift over to chris face he lip dehydrate and skin
parched
he breathe heavily
he awaken
he try to
sit up
it be a terrible struggle
barely make it to
he foot
chris stumble to the door of the bus looking up at the
hot sun
he have to sit back down on the small bus step
from he position on the step he lean back into the bus
and be able to grab he water jug
he pour it into his
mouth but nothing seem to satiate or hydrate he
he
drink it all
it spill over he face and chest

we observe chris for a moment as the wheel turn inside
he haunt eye
and a curiosity seem to overtake he
he crawl back to he copy of Tanaina Plantlore flipping
the page one by one until he arrive at the photograph
identifying the wild potato root and the word edible
beside it
he read the page to it conclusion and as
almost an afterthought turn the page to see if there
might be more
the word

jump off the page at he
the book describe the tiny green seed of the potato
root and warn that those with
lateral vein such as those invisible on the leaflet of
wild sweet pea be poisonous
the word
leading to partial motor paralysis
inhibition of digestion
nausea starvation



into chris face realize he desperate
plight

chris kneel holding one of the potato seed to the
sunlight and there we see they
the lateral vein that indicate poisonous seed


the diarylog





chris barely able to walk move at the pace of an
elderly man with he rifle through the underbrush
he
need food now

he shoot a squirrel
but as he move toward what he
think be he kill the squirrel make off with a
bleed tail
chris fire several desperate shot at
the squirrel but miss with each one

chris have a fitful sleep
short breath and
muttering

big moon shine above and we find on a tree branch the
squirrel chris have clip in the tail early in the
day
on the last leg of bleeding to death it fall
from the tree
the moon become the sun and we pass a couple of day
through vision of the nature about in vary light

chris labor up the riverbank with he water jug full
he be shirtless and absolutely emaciate
frightening
he pause at the river edge to take air into he lung
it be all he can do just to breath

chris standing at the
river edge catching he breath framed against the
background of the foot butte that he would so recently
climb with ease

now maintain this tableau something move from near
into frame
bit by bit we will realize it be a
and moving away from camera
toward chris
it lumber to within foot of he
onto chris
chris passive to the bear
presence

the bear just as passive towards chris as though
he do not represent enough of anything to eat
as the bear pass chris disappear
over the rise toward the river
chris a motionless and
slight silhouette

chris lay on the floor
chris
orange light twinkle
in he eye
chris
through the bus window we see
the orange glow of smoke rising into the air

chris
write in he diary log



set small signal fire today watch it
die tonight
back to as the ambient orange light fade into the
blackness of smoke

the diarylog







chris plop himself down into the middle of the bus
he
shake he head as if trying to say something and then
consider he rifle and abundant ammunition
but taking
he own life to avoid the agony of starvation be not an
option for he
no no no do not do this to i
the
frustration build enough adrenaline in he to scream
out





and that an unshared happiness be not
happiness















call everything by it right name

he arm near spasm reach up to the bunk grasping at
the blue sleep bag make by he mother
with great suffer and shattering tremble he force
he body to defy it agony and push it into the
sleep bag
the cloud obscure the sun
drumbeat





we on chris anguished face
director note
these CUs on chris face combine
both static and handheld CUs upside down and rightside
up moving zoom and pushins
straight side and
dutch angle
perhaps some intermittent distortion


we between chris and the sky in a dance
transition to the next world
it be hopeful
anguished sad and elate

chris approaching the annandale house
he backpack on
and body healthy
billie part the curtain ecstatic to see chris
approach alive and healthy
we but do not hear she call to walt
smile chris step up the curb approaching home
walt and billie we they as they gleefully run
out the front door to they returning son
chris he dispatch he backpack to the
ground and run toward he parent embrace



what if you see i running into you
arm
chris walt and billie on the cusp of a jubilant and
love embrace



would you see then
the resume with a and before an
embrace be possible



what i see now


chris looking at the sky a cathartic tear fall from his
leave eye
another from he right as the obscuring cloud
clear the sun

and he die alive
