not much time for a conversation after
you pull the trigger

he be get a point

okay
okay
we have be investigating
Zammito for year but we have never have
enough evidence for a warrant to search
he house
we get word through a snitch
that Zammito be planning on taking
bonanno out

we know all this

you just do not take out a boss
you
need permission from the other family
to do something like that
we informant
told we that Zammito be talking with
other boss and recording they
conversation in case they later claimed
they be not involved
look at these
tape
the guy have recorded every
conversation he be have for year

so we rob Zammito
you arrest we when
we come out and the content of the safe
be now evidence which you can use against
he

what be you get out of this

money
it be suppose to simple
in
and out


Zammito be not suppose to be there


mario i get to go
when i date arrive
will you explain to she i have an
emergency

of course mr
Zammito

hi
i be meeting frankie Zammito


why

vincent Bastaldi be in jail

for what

Laurant and vincent be in business
with Zammito

what kind of business

black market art
Zammito get to a few
key security guard at the metropolitan
museum
the Bastaldis supply the
artist to make copy of famous works
they would switch the painting send the
original to paris and the Bastaldis
would sell they to private collector


we be talking matisse renoir monet
we know for sure they replace van goghs
vase with twelve sunflower last week
with a copy
it be on loan from the
london national gallery and they be not
going to be very happy when they find
out about it

so Bastaldi make a deal with the feds
to trade up for he brother

yeah
he deliver the goods on Zammito
if we get what we wanted we would let his
brother go providing he tell we where
the van gogh and the other painting
be

no one have mention the part of the
plan about we get catch and going
to prison

we be leaving
raymond get the bag

you walk out with that bag and you will not
only have Zammito and he people after
you
you will have the entire united states
justice department

the

i can not bring the bureau into this
if

be do this for twenty year
when
