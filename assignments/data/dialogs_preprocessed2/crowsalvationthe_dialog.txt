boo

what be the deal with this bird
it be be hanging around
alex




this be where it happen
right
over here

yeah i know

be you ok

when lauren be missing the police
come to we house
they said they
be looking for she right
but i know now they have she and
the reason they bring she here
and know the could blame it on
you

no

be that i send they here
i
told they she come here sometimes
with she dirtball boyfriend
that be
exactly what i said

erin
it be not you fault

it be all i fault
oh god
i wish
i be dead

no
you do not

yes i do i really do

there be four of they



no

four large man
and still

she grab one of they gun
get
off a shot then run run for she
life

i do not want to know

she run
they breathing down she
neck

all the way from the road to
this tree



this tree
here where it happen

i do not want to see

she turned and faced they and go
down kicking and punch and
fighting they fighting death as
they stabbed she and stabbed she
fifty three time

she fight for she life because
life be worth live

think about that
and then tell i
how much you wish you be dead


why be not the incident report

nothing to report
all inmate
be present and account for

so you pretended nothing happen



hey Corvis fry
i do not really
see how it could be he

no
i would not expect you to

be forewarned
nature take it
toll
bon appetit

you lost he
now lay off the
fuck door

they botch the execution

could say that

christ
it be Corvis
tommy leonard
be right

maybe you be a little harsh on
he

babe

fucking crow

sign of the dead come back to life



how about sign of a big black bird

the dead can return given
sufficient motivation
and Corvis
have that

this guy david jenkins come back
as a ghost because i uncle owe
he four dollar
follow he
everywhere
ruined he life

time out
you really saying he be
back from beyond

because if you be losing you mind
i get a right to know

he be looking for something
will not
stop until he find it
sometimes the good way to get rid
of someone be to let they have
what they want

the man

with the scar


take everything i ever care
about
left i with nothing

so you be going to kill he

have to find he first

big deal daddy
and now he be just
a crook
badly even
and the weird
thing be

i wish i could hate he but i can not
he said he would never hurt either of
we and i know it be true and
i be going back

it be what lauren would do

i want to forget
forget what i
know
forget myself
forget
everything

re

keep it
because it connect you
to lauren
and it connect you to
i

no matter what happen i will make
sure everyone know
that you be
innocent
that you loved she
i
promise

i do not want to be i anymore

you know it do not work this way

i be out of this

partnership do not end like that
friendship do not

we friendship end when lauren
die

do you believe in ghost nathan
because there be a ghost threatening
we
