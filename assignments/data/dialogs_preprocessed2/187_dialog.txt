to meet the bicyclist
he be AfricanAmerican
anywhere from to
wear
wirerim glass a fresh white oxford shirt creased
slack and a solid green tie
an unobtrusive figure at
once familiar and yet undiscerning
the type you would pass
on a sidewalk and never even notice
he be
now to reveal the upper promenade
bike path and a dramatic view of lower manhattan behind
he
morning sun glimmer off the trade center tower
trevors shadow skitter along the wooden path ft
above the east river
fat briefcase strapped to the back of he bike rock
back and forth as he pump the pedal
now a sweep view of trevor alone on the
bike path a speck suspended above a sea of rush hour
traffic on the bridge below


wroughtiron train trestle covered with graffiti shake
as an overhead
trevor race parallel
with it along atlantic avenue
every city block become
more and more rundown



cyclone fence frame the stalwart face of the old
threestory administration build
ubiquitous gray
patch of paint fail to cover where taggers have most
recently left they mark

the purpose of the bicycle be to
demonstrate the principle of
centripetal force
that be the
opposite of the force we studied
yesterday which be

magnum force
hoot and laughter

centrifugal force
centripetal
force be where the acceleration of
a body moving in circular motion
be directed toward it center by an
oppose force thus create
momentum that constrain the body to
it circular path
like a gyroscope
see nothing
but yawn
it be good if i show you

Tywan and Auggie be busy talking in the corner

so you have a wife hide in a
closet somewhere

no
no wife

do not you ever get lonely

sometimes
there be this passage
in god lonely man by thomas
wolfe where he say
the
whole conviction of i life rest
upon the belief that loneliness be
the central and inevitable fact of
human existence
i believe that

god that be depressing

i new york mentality
it be not always easy looking on
the bright side

especially after spending a year
in and out of a hospital i
would guess

actually that be not the tough
part it be the robbery that be
be hard to recover from

Whatd they steal



i passion
i old unguarded
self
i resent that
i want they
back

they be still there
everybody
around i seem to have given up
they be all so beaten down
but
you be different
you refuse to
be beaten

so do you

remember the last time a student
surprise you

you mean where a light go on

yeah
where the kid surpass all
you expectation

be awhile
so few you can
actually get through to
