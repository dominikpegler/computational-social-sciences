this be from fritz
champion own library
this
be before the first issue of
the comic book hit the
stand in

it be a classic depiction of
good versus evil
notice the
square jaw of slayer
common in most comic book
hero
and the slightly
disproportionate size of
Jaguaros body to he head
this again be common but
only in villain
the
thing to notice about this
piece
the thing that
make it very very
special
be it realistic
depiction of it figure
when the character
eventually make it into the
magazine they be
exaggerate
as always
happen
this be vintage

wrap it up

you have make a considerably
wise decision

i kid going to go berserk

once again please

i son jeb
it be a gift for
he

how old be jeb

four

no

need to go now

what do i say

do you see any Telletubbies
around here
do you see
a slender plastic tag
clip to i shirt with i
name printed on it
do
you see a little asian child
with a blank expression
sitting outside in a
mechanical helicopter that
shake when you put a
quarter in it
no
well that be what you see at
a toy store
any you must
think this be a toy store
because you be in here
shopping for an infant named
jeb
one of we have make a
gross error and wasted the
other persona valuable
time

this be an art gallery i
friend
this be piece of
art

this be one of seventeen
original drawing by fritz
champion remaining in the
world
it be value will
triple every year

piece be to be treasured
to

to be
covete by every single one
of you banker friend that
think they be good than
you

what if i keep it

i be listening

room

what about jeb

i have a lock on the door

will it be near a window

store

congratulations you have a
mailbox
the sale be not
for two week

this one be under the
windshield of i car

you have never be sick

i do not know for sure
i do not think so

well if this be not a riddle
worthy of the riddler


so let we get some of the
usual question out of the
way
why be i use a cane
raise you hand if you be
think that

i fractured i leg
it be the
fifth time i have do that
particular bone
it do not
really heal well this time

raise you hand be you be
wonder who the hell
break the same bone five
time

i have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta
it be a genetic disorder
i
do not make this particular
type of protein very well
and it make i bone very
low in density very easy to
break
i have have fiftyfour
break in i life
i have
the tamest version of the
disorder
type one
there be type two type
three and type four
type
four do not make it very
long
that end we lecture on the
medical anomaly known as
elijah price

how certain be you that you
have not be sick in you
life

Seventyfive percent

Seventyfive percent
that be
not nearly good enough for
i
i be extremely skeptical

skeptical about what

you answer to i question
it be one thing to have never
be injured in you life
but to state that you have
never taken i will well that be
a whole new level

dad be injured

what be he talking about

in college
car accident

be it serious

he could not play football
anymore

i assumed because of the
train

you assumed wrong

it be over
you can go now

i think you skip a couple
step

you forget the now i be
going to tell you what the
hell be going on step
see
usually that come before
the it be over step
and
it always always come
before the you can go
step
what be over

the life of an idea that have
live too long in i head

there be probably only four
or five individual in the
world who can claim more
knowledge of comic than
myself
i have spent a third
of i life in a hospital bed
with nothing else to do but
read
i have studied the
form intimately
i have see
the pattern in they
the
reference to social and
cultural event and the
atmosphere that surround
they
i have come to believe
that comic be we last
link to the ancient way of
passing on history

the egyptian draw picture
on wall about battle and
event
country all around
the world still pass on
knowledge through pictorial
form
i believe that comic just
at they core now
have a
truth
they be depict
what someone somewhere feel
or experience
then of
course that core get chew
up in the commercial machine
and get jaz up make
titillate cartooned for
the sale rack

this city have have it share
of disaster
well
publicize one
it be
around the time of that
plane crash when it first
entered i head
and there
it stay as i wait and
watch the news over the
year
and then one day i see a
news report on a train
accident and it sole
survivor who be
miraculously unharmed
and just like that an idea
blossom into the flower of
possible reality

what be you idea elijah

if there be someone like i
in the world and i be at one
end of the spectrum
could not there be someone
the opposite of i at the
other end
person who can not be hurt
like the rest of we
kind
of person they be talking
about in those story

person they believe be
put here to protect the rest
of we
guard we

you think i dad be a
real

jeremy do not take another
sip of that drink

throw it in the trashcan
near the door and wait for
i outside
do it now
please

at the church
you be
following i be not you

technically no
i gambled
that you would attend the
church service
i just
wait for you

what be this about
this be
obviously some scam
be this
where you tell i one of
those picture be like an
investment

you have misunderstood

i see guy like you all the
time in i work
you find
someone you think be
emotionally vulnerable and
you tell they a fantastic
story utterly convince
and somewhere in there you
slip it in
i just need
you credit card number i
just need a small down
payment


do you know that this
morning be the first
morning i can remember that
i do not open i eye and
feel that sadness
do you
know what i be talking about
that little bit of sadness
i think the person that
write that note have an
answer for i
for why i
survive that train
for why
i life feel so out of
balance
but i guess that be what you
be counting on

i be going to leave now
good luck with you sale

what type of job do you have
david

you mention you have meet
guy like i in you work
what type of job would that
be

i work at the stadium as a
security guard




hi

i have come to a decision

oh

let i just ask you
something okay
and you can
be totally honest
i be
prepared for any answer
it
will not affect i

have you
with anyone
since we start have
problem
the answer will not
affect i

it will not affect i either
way

i decision be
i would
like to start again
pretend
we be at the begin
it be a big deal you walk
away from that train
it be
a second chance
if you want to ask i out
sometime that would be
okay



dunne it be jenkins we get
a guy at gate with a
bogus ticket
say he know
you
he will not tell i he
name

what be he look like

he be get the most beautiful
eye
the hell kind of
question be that
he be a
guy

send he packing
i be not
walking all the way over
there

consider he pack
i
do not like he attitude
Struttin around with a cane
and shit

hold up jenkins


they said i could not get in
with i ticket

it be for last week game

i have come to understand
that
an i will advised purchase in
the park lot

what do you want

not money
but i appreciate you
healthy cynicism in the
manner
it will be wise for
both of we to proceed with
great caution

we be not proceeding
anywhere together

we have already begin

one more time
what be it
you want

why be it do you think
that of all the profession
in the world
you choose
protection

be you for real

you could have pour coffee
in Starbucks you could have
learned to install track
light in office
building you could have
told people they horoscope
on the internet
you could
have be one of ten
thousand thing
but in
the end you choose to
protect people
you make
that decision
and i find
that very very interesting
now all i need be you
credit card number

that last part be a joke

i get this job because i
college coach called the guy
who manage the stadium
there be no hide meaning to
it

they need i at the gate

do you really want to see
the game
i can get you in


it get heavy ten minute
before kickoff

why do not we pat down

just give i a minute

be there a problem

that guy in green
sometimes
people carry weapon in
here
then they drink too
much
they be team be not
do so well bad thing
happen
we do random pat
down of the crowd to
discourage people from
carrying
if he be carrying he will step
out of line


i get you a seat in the
seven hundred level
it be nosebleed territory
but at least you will not get
spit on

how do you know that man
you bump be carrying a
weapon

probably the army jacket
those guy carry hunt
knife and stuff for show

you think he be carrying
a knife

i think he be carrying
something

but not a knife

i get this picture of a
silver handle gun tuck in
he pants
like on t
v

you have good instinct when
it come to thing like
that

like what

tell when people have
do something wrong

yes

have you ever tried to
develop it

i do not know what you be
asking

you be skill

listen
i get to be on the
sideline during the game
you can get to you seat by
taking the stairwell at

character in comic book
be often attribute special
power
Xray vision thing
of that sort

okay i do not want to play
this game anymore

it be an exaggeration of the
truth
maybe it be base on
something as simple as
instinct
like be able to
touch someone and tell
whether they have do
something wrong
or the
level of what they have do
wrong

the guy might not have be
carrying anything

or he might have be
carrying a silver handle
gun tuck in he pants

i have to go now

one last question

quick

in

he could not play

life i wanted
for ten
year i would be by the phone
waiting for a call telling
i he broke he neck in a
practice game
and if it
be not that call it would
be a call telling i he blow
out he knee or suffer his
third concussion
i have see
way too much of it in i
job
i can barely take it
when i client be in pain
i do not hate the game
i
admire the amount of skill
it involve and like
everyone else i be in awe
of how he could play it but
i could not give he i heart
and then have something
happen to he
and it always
do with that game
it be not a thing many people
would understand

you and i mother would have
a special connection

any way fate stepped in and
take football out of the
equation

and everyone live
happily ever after

i hope you can
keep an open mind

be this a religious thing

i own a comic book museum

walk the earth i believe
you husband be one of those
individual

i be glad you bring up fate

change the course of where
we live be headed

if you do go to new york we
can still develop this
we will just be forced to take
it slow
and in the end
that be definitely good
this be we second time
around david
i do not expect
we to get carry away
i guess congratulations be
the right thing to say


david
it be elijah
it
be so obvious
it be
referred to over and over
that be the key you see
the
repetition across time
that
mean at some point it be
all base on common thought
a common event a fact
it be this one issue that
bring it back for i
century comic
OneSeventeen
that be where
this group the coalition of
evil tried to ascertain the
weakness of every superhero

because they all have
one
just like you
the cell that make up you
muscle and you bone react
to force that act upon it
slightly different from than
mine
that be clear
you
cell react to bacterium and
virus slightly differently
than mine
that be also
clear
but for some reason
you and i react the exact
same way to water
we
swallow it we choke
we
swallow too much of it we
drown
however unreal it may
seem we be connected you
and i we be on the same
curve
just on opposite
end

the point of all this be we
now know something we
do not
you have a
weakness
water
it be you
krpytonite
