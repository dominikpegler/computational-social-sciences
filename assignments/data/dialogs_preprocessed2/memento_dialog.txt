license photo and all
be you sure you

so i will take a picture get a tattoo


the world do not disappear when you
close you eye do it
i action
still have meaning even if i can not
remember they
i wife deserve
vengeance and it do not make any
difference whether i know about it


tell i about she again

why

because you like to remember she
i want
to see you enjoy yourself

she be beautiful
perfect to i


do not just recite the word
close you
eye remember she



you can only feel detail
bit and
piece which you do not bother to put
into word
and extreme moment you feel
even if you do not want to
put it
together and you get the feel of the
person enough to know how much you miss
they and how much you hate the person
who take they away

i write an address in there too
might
be useful
it be this abandoned place
outside of town
i guy i know used to use
it for he big deal

deal

it be isolate

sound perfect
what do i owe you

the discount inn yeah


they treat you alright

do not remember

you know what we have in common

we be both survivor
take care leonard


i meet sammy through work
insurance
i be an investigator
i would
investigate claim to see which one
be phony


i have to see through people bullshit
it be useful experience because now
it be i life
when i meet someone i
do not even know if i have meet they before
i have to look in they eye and just
figure they out
i job taught i that
the good way to find out what someone
know be to let they talk



throw in the occasional why
but just
listen
and watch the eye the body
language



it be complicate
you might catch a sign
but attach the wrong meaning to it
if
someone touch they nose while they be
talking expert will tell you it mean
they be lying
it really mean they be
nervous and people get nervous for all
sort of reason
it be all about context


i be good
sammy be i first real
challenge

i be sorry i think i be check in here
but i have misplaced i key

hi leonard

probably in the room

i do not see i key

shit
wrong room

what


this be not you room
you be in
i
fucked up

this be not i room

no let we go

then why be this i handwriting

well tell i what the fuck going on

this be you room
you be up in now

when be i in here

last week
then i rent you another one
on top of this

why

business be slow
i told i boss about
you about you condition
he told i to
try and rent you another room

why do not you clean it out


you be still paying for it
it be still
you room


so how many room be i check into in
this dump

just two
so far


well at least you be be honest about
cheating i

yeah well you be not going to remember
anyway

you do not have to be that honest burt

leonard

always get a receipt

i be going to write that down

what time be it



i would just become an investigator when i
come across sammy
mr samuel
Jankis
strange case ever
guy semi
retire accountant
he and he wife have
be in this car accident
nothing too
serious but he be acting funny he
can not get a handle on what be going on



the doctor find some possible damaqe to
the hippocampus nothing conclusive
but
sammy can not remember anything for more
than a couple minute
he can not work
can not do shit medical bill pile up
he wife call the insurance company and
i get send in



i first big claim investigation i
really check into it
sammy can think
just fine but he can not make any new
memory he can only remember thing
for a few minute




he would watch

but anything long than
a couple of minute be too confuse
he could not remember how it begin
he
like commercial
they be short




the crazy part be that this guy who
could not follow the plot of green
acre could do the most complicate
thing as long as he have learned they
before the accident



and as long as he keep he mind on
what he be do

gentle




the doctor assure i that there be a
real condition called Korsokoffs
syndrome
shortterm memory loss rare
but legit
but every time i see he i
catch a look of recognition
just a
slight look but he say he can not
remember i at all


i can read people and i be think bad
actor
now i be suspicious and i order
more test


he wife have to do everything
sammy can
only do simple stuff
he could not pick
up any new skill at all and that be how
i get he

lenny
i think you would go for good
what bring you back

unfinished business
what make you think
i be not coming back

you said you be leaving town

thing change

so i see
it be good to see you
i name
teddy

guess i have tell you about i condition

only every time i see you
come on i will
buy you lunch

not hungry


it be i condition
i never know if i have
already eat so i always just eat small
amount

you do not have to remember to be hungry

it be weird but if you do not eat for a
while then you body stop be hungry
you get sort of shaky but you do not
realize you have not eat
have i tell
you about sammy Jankis

yeah yeah
i hear enough about he
tell i about john
you still think
he be here right

who

the guy you be looking for johnny
that be why you have not left
be i right

leonard you need to be very careful

why

well the other day you make it sound
like you think somebody might be trying
to set you up
get you to kill the wrong
guy

yeah well i go on fact not
recommendation okay

lenny you can not trust a mane life to
you little note and picture

why


because you be rely on they alone
you
do not remember what you have discover or
how
you note might be unreliable

Memorys unreliable

no really
Memorys not perfect
it be
not even that good
ask the police
eyewitness testimony be unreliable
the
cop do not catch a killer by sitting
around remembering stuff
they collect
fact make note draw conclusion
fact not memory
that be how you
investigate
i know it be what i used to
do
memory can change the shape of a room
or the color of a car
it be an
interpretation not a record
memory
can be changed or distort and they be
irrelevant if you have the fact

you really want to find this guy

he take away the woman i love and he take
away i memory
he destroyed everything
i life and i ability to live

you be living

just for revenge
that be what keep i
going
it be all i have

we will find he
where be you staying

discount inn
do not know what room
have not get i key

probably left it in you room


i be sorry i think i be check in here
but i have misplaced i key

hi leonard

so sammy can not learn any new skill
but
i find something in i research
conditioning
sammy should still be able
to learn through repetition
it be how
you learn stuff like riding a bike
thing you do not think about you just
get well through practice
call it
muscle memory whatever but it be a
completely different part of the brain
from the shortterm memory
so i have
the doctor test Sammys response to
conditioning

just pick up any three object

that be a test
where be you guy when
i do i


ah
what the fuck

it be a test sammy



some of the object be electrify
they would give he a small shock

they keep repeating the test always
with the same object electrify
the
point be to see if he could learn to
avoid the electrify object
not by
memory but by instinct

sorry
it be only i

sleep okay

yeah
you


i get to be someplace

pretty weird

useful
you never write a phone number on
you hand


i should be able to talk to i friend
about the license plate today


yeah the license plate



john gs license plate number
you have
it tattooe on you thigh



if it be registered in this state it will
just take second to pull up he license
and registration
i will call when i have
spoken to he

why do not we just arrange a meet now

i be not too good on the phone


it be great that you would
that you be
helping i like this

i be helping you because you helped i

so will you remember i next time you seo
i

i think you will

i be sorry

lenny before you go can i have i shirt
back please

lenny
i think you would go for good
what bring you back


they keep testing sammy for month
always with the same object carrying
the electrical charge

ah
what the fuck

it be a test sammy


ah
what the fuck

it be a test sammy

yeah
test this you fucking quack



even with total shortterm memory loss
sammy should have learned to instinctively
stop picking up the wrong object
all
previous case of shortterm memory loss
have respond to conditioning in some
way
sammy do not respond at all

it be enough to suggest he condition
be psychological not physical


we turned down he claim on the ground
that he be not covered for mental
illness
Sammys wife get stick with the
bill and i get a promotion for
reject a big claim

conditioning do not work for sammy so
he become helpless
but it work for i
i live the way sammy could not
habit and
conditioning
act on instinct

natalie right

who the fuck be dodd

guess i do not have to worry about he
anymore

who be he
what have you get i into

come inside


calm down
you be not into anything
it
be i problem you offered no help
it be
get nothing to do with you
investigation

that be the problem
how can i find john

when i do not know what be going on
how do you get i into this

leonard you offered to help when you see
what this guy do to i

how do i know he do that to you

i come to you straight after he do it
i
show you what he would do and ask for
you help

so i just take you word

yes

something feel wrong
i think someone
fucking with i
trying to get i to kill
the wrong guy

do you

what

kill he

course not


this have nothing to do with you
you
helped i out and i be grateful

you have to burn they

you decided to help i
trust yourself
trust you own judgment
you can
question everything you can never know
anything for sure

there be thing you know for sure

such as

i know the feel of the world
i know how this wood will sound when i
knock
i know how this glass will feel when i
pick it up
certainty
you think it be knowledge
but it be a kind of memory a kind you
take for grant
i can remember so much
i know the feel of the world
and i know she

you wife

she be go and the present be trivia
which i can scribble down as note


relax a little okay
take off you
jacket

it be not easy to be calm when

just relax

you do not seem the type

come on

it be backwards


here


it be
it must be for when i have find he




i have lost somebody

i be sorry


he name be jimmy

what happen

he go to meet somebody and do not come
back

who do he go to meet

guy called teddy

what do the police think

they do not look too hard for guy like
jimmy

when you find this guy this john

what be you going to do

kill he

maybe i can help you find he
i know a
lot of people
shirtless lying on top of the cover


i do not even know how long she be be
go
it be like i have wake up in bed and
she be not here because she be go to the
bathroom or something
but somehow i just
know that she will never come back to bed

i lie here not knowing how long i have
be alone
if i could just reach out and
touch she side of the bed i could know
that it be cold but i can not
i have no
idea when she left


i know i can not have she back but i want
to be able to let she go
i do not want to
wake up every morning think she be
still here then realize that she be not
i want time to pass but it will not
how
can i heal if i can not feel time


Sammys wife be cripple by the cost of
support he and fighting the
company decision but it be not the
money that get to she



i never said that sammy be fake
just
that he problem be mental not
physical
but she
she could not
understand
she look into he eye and
see the same person
and if it be not a
physical problem



he should just
snap out of it


so good old leonard shelby from the
insurance company give she the seed of
doubt just like he give it to the
doctor
but i never said that sammy be
fake
i never said that

something about a syringe
i have get a copy of the police report

i can not really
keep it all in mind at once


i have to keep summarize the different
section


yeah and there be page missing
i
guess i have be trying to log they all
the police give i the report
themselves
i deal with they a lot in
i insurance job and i have friend in
the department
they must have figure
that if i see the fact of the case
then i would stop believe that we
needed to find john

they be not even looking for john
the stuff they find in the car just fit
in with what they believe have happen
so they do not chase any of it up



none
okay blonde
yeah blonde be fine
discount inn
leonard


well what then

it be simple you just go to the bathroom

we go
to bed you wait till i fall asleep then
you go into the bathroom and slam the door

slam it

ring true for i

the police figure the guy be an addict
need money to score but i be not
convince
he be not going to be breaking in
when he be still get a stash that big

put it this way
be you wearing
designer suit when you sold insurance

i can not blame the cop for not taking i
seriously
this be a difficult condition
for people to understand
i mean look at
sammy Jankis
he own wife could not deal
with it


i told you about how she tried to get
he to snap out of it
it get much bad than that
eventually
Sammys wife come to see i at the
office and i find out all kind of
shit
she know that i be the one who have
build he case for sammy fake it



she told i about life with sammy how
she would treated he
it have get to the
point where she would get sammy to hide food
all around the house then stop feeding
he to see if he hunger would make he
remember where he would hidden the stuff
she be not a cruel person she just
wanted she old sammy back


mr
shelby you know all about sammy and
you decided that he be fake

position mr

that if i could just say the
right thing he would snap out of it and be
back to normal
if i know that i old
sammy be truly go then i could say
goodbye and start loving this new sammy
