i do not want anyone
treat he but reid
not so much as a
thermometer up he ass
understand

she be not here

you should come downstairs

hey



minimal activity in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex
and here the
anterior cingulate cortex
it be what help distinguish between
external and internal stimulus

what the hell do that mean

he be schizophrenic

what be you do here reid
paving
the way for he insanity defense

no need
there will not be a trial
this
be no act
the coma be real

whoa
wait a minute

you ever hear of Whalens infraction

re
the
in any schizophrenic these area would
be affected
but in someone with
Whalens they be hit hard and hit fast

Starghers neurological system be
infected by a virus in utero
it lay
dormant
in he case for about
thirty year
most likely he be
exhibit symptom for awhile now but
the infraction the breach do not
occur til today
you never know when
it will happen at what age or why
the
trigger vary but the result do not
he have no tie to reality
no awareness
of this world or the people in it

what about Thorazine
or
Desoxyn

the normal psychotropics do not work
he be not just catatonic he be
disappeared
like have a dream and
never waking up

this girl
julia hickson
only he
know where she be

then i be sorry
for she and for you

we will go back to he house pete
there be still a lot to do
analyze the
video track sales of the bleach go
through he record
maybe he own
property somewhere

they be in that fuck thing for forty
hour gordon
Fouroh
he get julia
at seventhirty last night
you know
what time it be now

peter
this be a longshot
i mean a
real long shot
you be going to think i be
crazy



it be fix

i be not signalling



sing a song of sixpence

i be not signalling

i be not



sing a song of sixpence

pocketful of fuck rye
what be wrong

nothing

why do we stop

i ask they to
we have a situation

when do he lapse into the coma

sometime yesterday morning

each tape be the same
he provide
food drink water a toilet
periodically a shower start
it be on
some kind of timer he be clever with
machine building thing
i think he
want they to believe this be a simple
kidnap
that there be a possibility
of rescue
of survival
but it be just
a form of torture
at the end of the
fortieth hour the drain shut
the
water start and do not stop
we have already lost more than a day
if
she be not find tonight
she die like
the rest

to miriam henry and
catherine
john and ella baines as well as the
Sunerset board of director have given
they approval but the decision be
yours

what about the legality of this

Stargher be in custody
the functional
equivalent of be under arrest
normally we would Mirandize he and if he
do not lawyer up we would interrogate he
but because of he condition he do not
have the capacity to waive those right

so what you be asking we to do be
illegal

no not at all
we be dealing with exigent
circumstance
somewhere there be a
kidnapped woman still alive
if we
weigh the suspect constitutional
right against the public safety
the law favor the victim and give we a
lot of leeway
it be called the public
safety exception

so what can you do

pretty much anything we want
there be a
chance to save a human life
because of
that Stargher have no reasonable
expectation of privacy

what if

what if he be not like this
what if he
be normal
conscious
how far would
you go

as far as i needed

do you think he would tell you what you need
to know

there be always a chance they will confess

really
i do not work with violent
case i work with child
but even a
kid lie
they love it when they get
you to believe something that be not
true
do not you think Stargher would do
the same

sometimes
once they have be catch
they feel a need for disclosure
they
have so much they want to tell
but they have never have a sympathetic ear
they need someone to understand why
Stargher used to hide the body very
carefully
it be part of the ritual
some be not find for week and any
physical evidence have be meticulously
wipe clean
but these last three
they be still in water always in
water but
listen he be not just careless
it
go beyond that

okay
let we assume he wanted you to
find he that some part of he hated
what he be do
most likely that
part be dead
schizophrenic with
Whalens infraction sever all tie with
the real world
i be sorry i really be

be it possible

if he come to trust i yes but it
take month to build that kind of
trust
someone like Stargher can not
distinguish between fantasy and reality
it be all the same
he might tell i
she be in timbuktu and absolutely one
hundred percent believe it to be true
but she be



julia

not she
julia
not thing or it or
she
do you know anything about she
do you know what we have be through
julia be everything to i
can you say
that about anyone

thanks

you sure you want to go through with
this

what else do we do

i do not know pete but for god
sake
this be nut
do you really
understand what they be going to do

i do not have to

why jeopardize what we have already do
we caught the sonofabitch
carl
Stargher
that be going to be like
bundy Gacy dahmer
case that make
career
but if we push we luck
if
this be all bullshit and we come out
smelling like it

tell you what
if this thing burn we
i take that heat
i give you permission
to point you finger at i and say it
be all he idea


that be not what i be talking about pete
i be talking about waking up and
realize this girl going to die

that will not happen

they be ready

should not we get a catheter in he

they take care of that thank you
henry

why do not you give we guest a little
tour

gentleman you stand before the one and
only neurological cartography and
synaptic transfer system

it provide a highly detail map of the
human mind
not the brain any can
do that
the mind
it read and process electronically
allow information to be transferred
and interrupt
let we say you thought could be stored
on
if someone have the right kind
of player they could watch and listen
to what you be think

but we can not record or store the data
the connection between nerve cell be
constantly be modified

it be like the early day of television
the subject send out a live feed and
you receive it during time of broadcast
whatever happen happen
all you have
to do be tune in


but you do more than tune in
you
become part of the snow

i still do not understand why i can not do
this
this be not some trouble kid
you be dealing with

i realize that

how hard could it be

the first
what
six or seven time i
go in
remember what happen

disorientation nausea migraine
hallucination insomnia paranoia

like a new year day hangover

he need to be turn over

this man be deeply disturbed he

you do not know the procedure

i know he

that may be true but you do not have
catherines gift
she
what happen here

we remove eight metal ring

then he should like this

they be comfort by the feel of
weightlessness
like floating in water

do not touch that please

sorry

this be not you responsibility
remember that
do not let they use guilt
as a tool
if you want to stop say so

i will be fine

she said convincingly

eye on the chemicaldrug
monitor
that be the stuff

about twelve year of research right
miriam

do not remind i

what be it be they exactly

Psychostimulants serotonin
stabilizer meprobamate Neurontin
lithium carbonate
and i baby
it
duplicate and expand upon the effect
of a chemical call oxytocin forcing a
break in the neuron connection that
hold experience
so new experience can
form

there be a touchsensitive microchip
implant in she hand
if she become
frighten disoriented or simply want
to end the session she signal we to
abort

although none of what she experience be
real she can be tricked into think
it be
the mind be awfully gullible so
she need to monitor herself

catherine
i be about to start
if you
want i to wait or

no
no

you said she have a gift


not a gift
highly evolve area in
she cerebral cortex that be all

genetic fluke

catherine have a tremendous capacity for
empathy
when we start there be a number of
test subject other therapist who
act as receiver
all they do be
observe and report
nothing more
but
catherine she have the ability to feel
what be happening
she understood
and the patient respond
edward
engaged she in dialogue take she
place show she thing
he know she
care



intravenous administration complete



initiating connection



transfer begin hour minute
second

hello

yeah you like that do not you

be you name carl

another little boy i know he have a
horse too

he name edward
the boy not the
horse

what be the matter carl

what be wro

where you come from priddy thing



gentleman



she be back

what happen

must have be rather unusual

re
whiteyellow area
if she neural activity stay within this
range i know she be selfcognitive
as if she be have a dream but she
know she be dreaming
she can wake up
any time she want to

re
orange section
however if she level of involvement be
rather intense as it be just now she
can perceive thing as true
it be
difficult to keep perspective

what happen here

we do not talk about that

what happen

well theoretically while she be inside
if she come to believe that Starghers
world be she world she mind have the
power to convince the body that anything
do to it be um actually do

that be why we monitor the use of the
drug so closely
we do not want she
get to that degree of perceptual
disorientation

pump in two liters of pure oxygen
please henry

dr
kent

deep breath

be it cold in here

what happen

what be wrong

catherine

i will get she

edward baines i presume
hi ed
i be pete

do you think that be funny

no
not at all
from what i
understand he know im here be not
that right

i read about a woman in texas who be in
a coma for seven year
every time she
husband come to visit she heart would
beat fast
be not that something
i
do not know what name scientist have for
something like that

it do not have much to do with science

what then

the soul
the spirit
whatever you
want to call it

ah the part of we that can not be
explain

agent novak

peter okay

do you feel there be a side of yourself
you do not show people

absolutely
i suppose everyone do

just like we all have fantasy right
thing only we know that we do not
share

that be what therapist be for right

during the session
when i be inside
i see those thing
what a person
hide what they despite what they want
to control
with Stargher

with Stargher i see thing

what do you see

kingdom
he utopia
life without consequence or restriction
he be not even carl Stargher anymore
he be this
idealize version of
himself who can do anything he
please
without fear
horrible
primitive ugly thing
uncomfortable
re
edward
i do not want to talk in here

Whyd you bring he here

you be the shrink you tell i

as soon as i meet he you know i would say
yes
he make julia real for i

it be an old lawyer trick
target the
emotion
do it right you get a
reluctant witness to testify a scare
kid to confess

before i be with the bureau i be an
attorney a prosecutor
mr
law and
order
and then
i have a murder case
in north carolina
charles gish
butcher seventeen people in three
day
and because of one tiny piece of
taint evidence he walk
that be when i quit the das office and
joined the

you think Stargher wanted to be
catch

i do yeah

you be right
there be a part of he
that know the truth
about what he
do about himself

what about julia

this be going to sound terrible but
i do not think she matter anymore
not
to he
he never finished she
the
other
he be able to make they he

you think you can do this do not you

he might tell i about julia
the part
of he that want to help that feel
shame and remorse
who want to be
redeem

this be Stargher we be talking about

not Stargher not really
he be split
himself right down the middle
Goodevil rightwrong mercifulcruel
monster
and an innocent child
if i
could reach the boy

whoa
hold on
be not they the same
guy

do not you feel there be different side
to every personality
maybe even the
bad of we be capable of one decent
act
we be all human

it be hard for i to see Stargher as
human capable of something like
remorse


then what be he

evil

if you believe that

maybe this be a big fuck waste of
time

what happen to charles gish

what happen

what difference do it make

tell i

right after the trial the night after
he be released
mr
and mrs
frank
simmons find charlie sitting in they
live room watch with they
twelveyear old daughter margaret
he would
cut she right down the middle with a
carve knife

find the girl heart in the freezer
he think they might want to keep it
luckily the next thing he do be slit
he own throat
i be convince of one thing
charles gish could have be raised by
ozzie and harriet and the same thing
would have happen

child can experience abuse bad than
charlies
and grow up to be someone
who would never ever hurt another
live thing

you be sure of that

yes
