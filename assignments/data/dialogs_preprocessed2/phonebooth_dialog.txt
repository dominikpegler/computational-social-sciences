everybody do
harm to somebody

take it out on she

suppose that be the only way i can
get to you
you claim you love
she

yeah i do

you do not even love yourself

but kelly
i would never hurt

still you have to uphold you
status as an honorary asshole

listen i have treated all i woman
decent
i never laid a hand on any
of they even when provoke
and i
always let they down easy
i be not ready to let kelly go
maybe i never will be

what if she dump you first
what be the odds she be already taken
up with somebody
one day soon
you will come home and find she go
along with the player and the


i be not going to let you mindfuck i
all day
that be it
this call be
end

not until i say it be

what happen if i hang up

you do not really want to find out

i be dying to hear this
what the
fuck can you do about it up in
you fuck high window with you
goddam binoculars

i never indicated i have binoculars
i said i have a highly magnify
telescopic image of you that
bring you up so close i could see
where you nick yourself under the
chin shave this morning

oh while you be at it have a
look up i ass

i may very well do that stu
in
the meantime think about what kind
of device have a telescopic sight
mounted on it

what
you mean
like a rifle

highpowered
calibre bolt
action remington with a carbon
one modification and a state of the
art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope
and you be in the cross hair stu

i be suppose to believe that

there be only one way i can prove it
to you
hang up the receiver and
find out
at this range the exit
wound ought to be about the size of
a small tangerine

and you be just going to kill i
for no reason

for plenty of reason
because you
hung up
for year i hated people
hanging up on i
Exgirlfriends
woman i do not even know
prospective employer

i get hung up on all the time
you
get used to it

or else you do not
i worked for
month get people to switch to
be insulted at and be
hung up on hundreds of time a day
the one that cursed i out for
invading they privacy never
bothered i as much as those that
click off without even bother
to reply

then why do not you go after one of
they

maybe you be one of they

hey i have work in a boiler room
myself peddle term life
i
would never be rude to a fellow
salesperson

look through the sight and select
somebody

i respect you right to privacy
i have be to therapy myself
the
department provide it

it be not good form for a cop to be
admitting that but

tell he not to come any close

stop right there
back up a few
step
back where you be

if it make you more comfortable

tell he to read you you right

i want you to read i i right and
stop asking question

al least tell i you first name

no gun and no name
you be a
highly underprivileged person

demand a lawyer

and get i a lawyer too
i want a
lawyer bring down here to
negotiate i surrender

brilliant stu
keep wing it

it will be hard to find a lawyer
will to risk he life
but if
you hand over the gun

how can i when you will not let i
take it out

we will take it out for you as
soon as you exit the booth with
you hand raised and

now we be back to that again

always get out of the booth

you can not stay in the booth

well i like it in the fuck
booth
it be i whole world now
it be i booth and i be never coming
out

we be not about to force you
because there could be a
miscalculation and then we would never
find out why this happen

why be it so important to know
the guy be dead
be not that
enough
knowing be not going to
make he alive again
so who give
a fuck

it be what make the job
interesting
finding out why
something drive you to do this
you do not go out today expect
this to happen
it be a nice day
you be out for a walk
and then
suddenly it all changed

all i wanted be to make a phone
call
one lousy phone call for
thirtyfive fuck cent

careful stu
do not volunteer too
much

you get some bad news on that call

the bad

something that push you over the
edge

and i have be falling ever since

time to land

when you hit bottom you die

i be you safety net

if i tell you what you want to know
you will die too

i will go see about that lawyer

now that be a good idea

he be lucky
i have he center in
i cross hair
i really have to
restrain myself

it be not the police
it be the
media
you be news stuart

you have never get this much press
for any of you client
i be
making you a famous person

they be just hope for coverage of
i dying in the gutter

they presence be putting the
police on they continue good
behavior

those cop be just looking for any
excuse

then do not give they one

who could it be

kelly
she be worry about i

maybe she be see this on
television
it must be on every
channel by now
break news

she do not watch daytime

one of the neighbor could have
alerted she

why be you saying this
you want
i to reach in i pocket so you can
see they open fire

that be an unwarranted accusation
and very unbecoming in light of the
good advice i have given in the past
have i ever steered you wrong

god how i would love to hear she
voice

it might even be worth it
she be
insistent be not she

if she know i be in trouble she
will not give up

probably glue to the by now
i be watch coverage on two
station now
channel surfing
well there you be on two and four
and five
not any decent angle on
you though stick inside there

but if you would take one or two step
outside and look up i think they
could get a clear picture of you

you said i be not allow to leave
the booth

i might be will to bend the
rule and let you enjoy you moment
of fame
set the phone down
without hanging up
and take a
step or two outside
just for a
minute
then come straight back in
or i will be forced to provide live
coverage that should rival the
historic Zapruder footage
nothing like an explode head to
excite viewer interest

no thank
i will stay where i be

it be only a suggestion
since
you be convince i be going to plug
you anyway it can not matter much

if you shoot i you give yourself
away

even without a muffler they would
never hear the report with all this
noise
afterwards it would take they
a good ten minute to realize you
be not plug by some overzealous
officer
then they will blame the
media for incite a crackpot
vigilante to come down here and do
the team job for they

you expect they to come
you have
this all work out

i write the scenario and you all
play you part as directed

poor kelly
what she must be going
through

why do not you tell she how you feel
about she

i would never get the word out
not
with fifteen or twenty round in
i

you can not be certain they would fire
they would see it be only a phone

they would not wait to see

why do not she hang up

it be she
she be not calling i
she be over there

be she

the blonde girl in the green
jacket

can not miss she
very attractive
be not she

she must have hear all the commotion
and come downstairs

it be somebody else who know i
cell number
it be you

you continue to impress

why be it so important that they
kill i

because that be how i win

this time you will not
if you want
i dead you will have to do it
yourself

either way i can not lose

it be all a game to you because
you be incapable of feeling
you be not even human

i pride myself on that
what be so
great about be human
it be the
low form of life on this planet
and i have taken it upon myself to
thin the herd

i quit
i be not answering back any
more
i will not hang up but i be not
playing

stu
stu do not be that way
you be taking the pleasure out of
it

this here Helfand of new york
telephone

glad to help out

have you get the number of that
booth

sure do

can you tap into that call

it can be do

but not without a warrant
you
could be violate this psycho
civil right
especially if he be
on the line with he fuck
psychiatrist

shit
i do not want to blow this on
a technicality
trace the call
be not any violation be it

as long as we do not listen in

okay we have get to know who he be
talking to and they current
location

that i can handle
as long as they
keep the circuit open

i need the number and an address to
go with it

stuart i friend
do you want to
see how close i can come without
actually hitting you

may i call attention to the yellow
page

hollow point be design to break
up on impact
it would have behave
differently if it have pierced you
soft flesh
the piece would have
bounce around looking for a way
out
that be where the real damage
occur finding an exit
deflect off all that bone

still the silent treatment
i
father used to dish that out when
he choose to punish i
not a word
spoken one time for over a
month
i would try and goad he to
acknowledge i exist but he
stare right through i
you be
bringing back unhappy childhood
stu
that be not wise

since you be ignore i i will
focus on someone else
there she be nice and sharp
i
can see the two little puncture in
each earlobe and i god what kind
of a girl would have she nostril
pierced

no

what be that
louder stu
we
must have a bad connection

leave she out of it

i do not expect she to show up
here
but since she have i will
improvise

do not
please do not
i be sorry
i be talking to you again
i will
talk all you want

it be a bad dye job
the black
root be growing in and it make
she look cheap

i have screw up she life enough
already
please do not hurt she

i do not necessarily have to kill
she
i could be persuade to
settle for a reasonable mutilation
which part of she displease you
most
if she turn a bit more in
profile i be accurate enough to
remove the tip of she unpleasantly
protruding nose
it be just
cartilage
any decent cosmetic
surgeon will have she looking
well than ever

you can see she talking to the
police now
she be identifying
herself as you wife
they be very
interest in who you be
they be
taking she over to see the officer
in charge
what be he name

what do you mean psychiatrist
he
do not see any psychiatrist

then who you husband be talking
to

there be some guy that called the
house this morning and said weird
stuff to i

stu seem to be checking thing out
with this person

he have not get many friend i can
tell you that

remain here please
we may need
you later

you will not hurt he

we will do we good not to

she will not even feel it when it
happen

take i instead

do not distract i
Nows the time
to be absolutely still
i have to
hold i breath as i squeeze
gently

no
i be hanging up
that be it

shit

maybe they already trace it
anyhow it do not matter
look
like he be coming out

i have giving myself up
take i

first the gun
we want to see you
toss away you weapon

shit
i can not

freeze where you be
turn around
and keep those hand clasp
take he

what be going on with these fuck
phone call

hold you fire
let he answer it

be you nut

let they talk
he be not going
anywhere
he be going back inside the booth

yeah

you get the wrong number
hang up

wrong number
wrong number

aw relax stu
only yank you
chain
now can we start over

those cop will not wait much longer

what else can they do
they can not
afford to just shoot you like i
can
not with so much media
coverage
not unless you make some
stupid aggressive move
the mobile unit just rolled up

will you look at that
i must be
going out over the network
bet
they be preempt usual
program

and just think if you survive
this you trial will be televise
and you can try and make the world
believe i ever exist
i would be
you only defense

how be they going to prove that i
killed anybody when there be no gun

they will plant one
the police
be not above that when they be
desperate to convict

no sir
no gun and i walk

do not you think i take that into
account
be i a fool

what do you mean

have not i considered every
eventuality
i know they would come
and cordon off the block
and that there would have to be a gun
someplace

where

it be a small booth stu
have you
check every inch of it

it be not on the floor

then what be left

up above

could be
why do not you reach up
there and lift the plastic sheet
and feel around

if they see i reach for something
they could open fire

they could
but you have to know
if it be there
do not you

i totally do not give a shit

in a narrow space tuck just to
the left of the fluorescent bulb
you can almost see it outline if
you look closely

it do not matter
i know about
ballistics
the slug in that dead
guy come from you rifle not any
handgun

you see how hollow point splinter
on impact
there be nothing much
for ballistics to match to
the
same make
calibre bullet be
in that handgun
the prosecution
rest

there be no gun up there
i do not
see a damn thing

slide you finger up under the
plastic and you will feel the cold
metal surface
there be four
round left in it
should you
decide to shoot you way out

i could never shoot anybody

you could shoot i stu
you would do
that in a minute if you could

and i would fucking love it

now you be speaking from the heart
come on just lift the partition a
few inch and feel what be there
for you

i be not get i fingerprint on
you fuck weapon
what about
powder residue
how be they going
to explain that to a jury

do you think that matter with so
many eye witness
do it
or should i refocus i
attention on kelly

no

you carefully distract i from
she before and i let you get away
with it
but if you be not going
to play fairly
there she be again
so close i
feel like i could touch she

get off she

then mind i when i speak

look
i be reaching up with i left
hand
i be pushing against the
partition
it be giving
i be
feeling around with i fingertip
it be filthy up there

i be touching something

one of the fine handgun
remington make
lightweight
efficient and highly accurate

i be not picking it up

not right now
but eventually

i would not have a chance

i never said you would

i be not insane

but you be get there
it
would not take much

that will not happen

you could pull the gun down shove
it in you own mouth and jerk the
trigger
that be another option

why would i do that

to please i
and ensure that
nothing happen to kelly
i do not
necessarily have to deal with she
today in the midst of a crowd of
cop
i can take she out any time
i like
when she go to pull down
she blind at night or when she
walk the dog first thing in the
morning
what be it a jack
russell

okay
i know you can do it
but
do not talk about that
please

i would rather see you remembered as
the gallant gunman who tried to
shoot he way past an army of
police than as a coward who
suck the barrel
i be do you
for you
create a final image
that endure
the outraged new
yorker who be push too far
when some lowlife street person
try to invade he territory he
retaliate
and when the force of
the law closed in he be
defiant
to the end

like that nerdy sonofabitch who
blow those three wiseass kid away
on the subway

exactly
nobody minded that he be
a sicko
he be living out a new
yorkers pet fantasy
can you
remember that movie where peter
finch start screaming i be not
taking it anymore
and everybody
picked up on it

i be mad as hell and i be not taking
it anymore


that be it
poor finch get
himself an oscar for that
but he
be dead by then
i mean he really
die
maybe playing that part take
too much out of he

i be not taking it anymore
i be
not taking it anymore


that be the way
psyche yourself
up
everybody respect a man who
fight back even if he go a
little berserk in the process

fighting back
that be what it be
about

exactly
we all understand the
poor schmuck that get laid off and
come back and shoot all he
boss
we all think of do
that
but only he have the ball
the terminally i will husband who get
he policy canceled and machine
gun the insurance company office
maybe somebody will finally get the
message
you can fuck human being
over only for so long before they
come back at you
i be still
holding on kelly and she look very
concern
i could relieve all
that anguish in a fraction of a
second
shall i

i be on i knee begging you

stand up stu
you be embarrass
yourself

stu i want you back on you foot
facing i
so you can see what i be
going to do to she

be a man stuart
do not let they
see you like this
you be an
embarrassment to i

listening to
transmission
officer on east side of the street
report subject remove a dark
metallic object from he pocket
we well move

hold all fire until you actually
identify a weapon
we be do
this on fuck

police
be this an emergency
hello
be someone on the line

you have make you point
who be
going to believe i have get a sniper
with a telescopic sight holding i
in a fuck phone booth at th
and th

it take you a while to believe it
yourself

if you would put a bullet in that
captain ramey it would have be a
different story but you be too
wise to do that

why do not you do it for i
wave
the old captain back over and get
he nice and close and then use the
handgun on he

why i
you could pick off any of
those cop from you window up
there
like you do that pimp
and that tourist last week
but
this time you want i to do you
killing for you

and you will
to save kelly

muffled almost
inaudible
can you speak up sir
what be
you name

that be well stu
now turn
around so i can see you

this booth
it be i whole world
shrink down to four foot by three
foot
not much big than the
size of a coffin

they can put handle on the booth
and bury you in it

when i see you put that bullet into
that black dude i know you would never
let i out of this phone booth
alive

you be wasting i time
reach up
and take the gun

peer upward
squint
let i see you first
what harm
can that do you
you be in one of
those window
i have get to know
which one

no need for that

be so far i could never
identify you
i do not even want
to

what be it then

do not worry that i would try to point
you out
you would shut i up with one
of you
calibre hollow point
before i could even raise a finger

why do it matter so much

i want to see that you exist
like
god exist
it be not enough to
believe
you want to see he
just once even at a distance

and then you would take the gun down
and use it
we have a deal on
that

show yourself to i and i will take
the gun down
i swear

i do not have to make deal
and
you be irritating i by trying to
negotiate
god do not have to
prove anything
he just strike
you down when he get in the mood

stop
i will not ask to see you
anymore

i be glad that be settled
but look
who else have show up

who

i guess she see the coverage on
and just could not keep away

what be you talking about

the hotel just arrive
and a
very beautiful little hotel she be
actually i would classify she as more
of a motel

mavis
i do not see she

she be too far back behind the
police line
but i have get a fine
shoot at she from up here

you do not even know what she look
like

you be in an enviable position now
stu
you get to choose between
they
tell i which one

i can not

which will it be
kelly or mavis
or should i simply select one

i need time to think

you have get to be more in touch with
you feeling
you said you love
kelly

i do

then i be do you a favor putting
you out of the way of temptation

it be not mavis fault
it be all
i fault

then take the third option
reach
above you and pick up the gun

you will leave they both alone

there will not be much point in
harm they without you around to
impress

i will do it

let i see you do it

i need one minute
one last
minute please
can you give i
that
