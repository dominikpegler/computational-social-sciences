they miss the battlefield
i think
we do too

but one can still keep a sword sharp
riding out in the name of the king
law

it be not easy for the young one to
learn knightly virtue without the
hard teach of war and quest
it
be only you example lancelot that
bind they now

which be the great quality of
knighthood
courage
compassion
loyalty
humility
what do you say

what
then seeing he have
an audience
the great
they blend together
like the metal we mix to make a
good sword

i do not ask for poetry
which be
it

all right
truth
it must be truth
above all
when a man lie he murder
some part of the world

conversation and court life do not
suit i
i must take i rest in the
forest

have not merlin mend you wound

it be deep

you will be sorely missed
heal
yourself and come back

why
you will destroy arthur and
we

the law forbid it

love demand it

there be thing about love

nothing

by i knight sword i swear faith

Guenevere

i be alone and betray
by i wife
by i beloved friend by i knight
and by you
perhaps most of all by
you
for you make i you forge
this wretched life
and like a child
tire of a toy you toss i aside a
babble lecher trot after i
sister

that be i destiny
i have a destiny
too

with all you power you be content
to be ridiculed laugh at

i power fade arthur
i resort to
cheap trick
yes
i enjoy every moment of i
foolishness i join in the make of
it so no one can betray i
but
you
you betray yourself

i
i have live by the oath of king
and knight

you betray the boy who draw the sword
the boy who see the dragon
the
dragon who move close by coiling
and uncoil restless looking
down waiting for the king to be a
king

i must do it myself
i must kill
they both
lancelot and Guenevere
will you ride with i merlin

i cannot
i must not
here i must
stay

crazy old fool
you think yourself a
kingmaker
ha
meddler more likely
look what a mess you have make of
thing

i
perhaps perhaps
i be losing
interest morgana
i have helped
menor meddle in they affair if
you would have it that waysince
the dawn of time
now let they live
by they own law
let they stand on
they own foot

morgana make a man out of i
kiss

the king without he sword the land
without a king

we be to blame

when arthur build the castle i carve
out a place for myself where i could
laugh or sleep and no one would
bother i

people make you laugh

they do

why

they do not know how close they live
to the edge of delight or disas

happiness or horror

in the fold of the earth where the
force that hold the world together
be more alive i power be strong
here i will possess you as a man
possess a woman
and the god the
eunuch the mule that i be will be
no more
