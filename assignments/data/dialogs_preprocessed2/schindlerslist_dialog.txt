i think most people right now have
other priority

like what

get the contract and i be sure you will
do very well
in fact the bad thing
get the good you will do
it be a
pleasure

that be the easy part
finding the money to buy the company
that be hard

you know anybody

jew yeah
investor

jew can no longer own business
sir that be why this one for sale

well they would not own it i would own
it
i would pay they back in product
they can trade it on the black market
do whatever they want everybody
happy

pot and pan

something they can hold in they
hand

i do not know anybody who be
interest in that

they should be

what be that

you do not recognize it
maybe that be
because it be not what i ask for

you ask for shoe polish

i buyer sold it to a guy who sold
it to the army
but by the time it
get there because of the cold
it broke the whole truckload

so i be responsible for the weather

i ask for metal you give i glass

this be not i problem

look it up

this be not you problem
everybody
want to know who i get it from and
i be going to tell they

metal

let we say this be what you give i
these be fee i have to pay some
guy
this be i commission
this be
what i bring you back in occupation
currency

that be a nice shirt

you do not know where i could find a

i do not know ten or twelve
that be
a good color
dark blue gray

write down you measurement

i be going to need some other thing
as thing come up

the do not own the train
somebody get to pay
whether it be
a passenger car or a livestock car
it do not matter which by the
way you have to see
you have to
set aside an afternoon go down to
the station and see this

so you get thousands of fare that
have to be paid
since it be the
that be reserved the train logically
they should pay
but this be a lot
of money
the jew
they be the one riding
the train they should pay
so you
get jew paying they own fare to
ride on cattle car to god know
where
they pay the full fare
the turn around pay the railroad
a reduce excursion fare and pocket
the difference

excuse i
