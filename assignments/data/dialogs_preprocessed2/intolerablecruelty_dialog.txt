before she married rex
we have some
very nice time prior to that
we
be quite close

be this a lover

please

and how would you define you
relationship to mrs
rexroth
you
know you be she

mother

what

she mother

hi sweetie

hard to believe i know
i be sure you
be frequently mistaken for sister

he will regret this

have you ever meet mr
rexroth

no
i have not
but i have be out of
town
hello rex
hello there

you be never invited to meet you
soninlaw

no
uh uh
i do not think so
hmm
no
well
no

objection you honor
this be not
about mrs
Rexroths filial
obligation

sustained

do you know mrs
rexroth be marry

of course
of course she be marry
what else would she be
single
i
do not think so

let i tell you something about patty

who be patty


oh
that be she name
patricia
like
mine
i be pat and she be patty
but she changed it after seeing some
like it hot
to Marylin
after
Marylin monroe

i see
and what be you going to
tell we about patty slash Marylin

when she be a tiny girl
and people
ask she what she wanted to be when
she grow up
she never said the usual
thing little girl say like
nurse ballerina anchorwoman
she always said
when i grow up i want to be
divorce


divorce be she childhood aspiration

well not just divorce
she used to
say i want to be divorced from some
big dumb rich guy
and i guess
she dream be coming true
i be happy for you patty

it be like that scene in the
godfather
frankie Pentangeli be
called to testify against the family
and he be in court and he look into
the spectator gallery and see his
brother
they bring the brother
from sicily
and frankie can not say a
word
he can not testify
that be what
it be like seeing pat in there
i
could not even have ruth cross examine
she

why do you think she do it

maybe she wanted a free trip to
maybe they offered she money
massey
be very seductive
who know

maybe they put a horse head in she
bed

that stink
they left you with
absolutely nothing
it make you
wonder about the entire legal system
like rodney king

they buy she speech
if i be
only in it for Rexs money he
should not have to give i any

that do not make sense
it be like
punishing you for be goal oriented

well you can live here as long as
you want
do you have any plan

nothing specific but i will have i
own place soon

so Marylin
be that what you said
when you be a little girl

probably
every woman in i life be
divorced at least twice
what be i
suppose to say
anthropologist

i beg you to have a baby

in the godfather after the courtroom
scene frankie Pentangeli open his
vein in the bathtub

you be not

no
i will see some blood before this
be over but it will not be mine


she get absolutely nothing
zero
zip

so
i will not be seeing she
you
client usually visit i after the
settlement

not this one
not unless she
cover plastic surgery which
incidentally she do not need

everyone need plastic surgery
you
need it

i do not need it

you want Botox

what the hell be Botox

it be a form of botulism
i just inject
it into you forehead and it
paralyzes you eyebrow so you can not
raise they

why in god name would i want

no frown line
new watch

it be a LeCoultre revers
you can
flip the face and set it for two
time zone

why would you need two time zone
you never leave beverly hills

it be a gift from a client

set one side for bel air

Botox

to cry on deal
one thing lead to
another and before i know it

we realized we would always be very
attracted to one another

i have no idea until after but

baby
you be so

howard

what a touch story

you know miles after i wife
wife mastectomy thing be
never the same
this might sound
cold well maybe not to you massey
but
i like i woman with two boob

howard and i be here mile because
i have learned through bitter
experience that when it come to
matrimonial law you be the very
best

as you be well aware i previous
marriage end with an unjustified
strain on i reputation i motive
be question
i be slander in
court

you do good massey

therefore in an effort to remove any
trace of suspicion from i sweet
howard i wish to execute a pre
nuptial agreement

and there be no talking she out of
it
believe i i have tried

they say the massey prenup have never
be penetrate

she said penetrate
heh heh heh

oh for the love of

that be true be not it miles
you
prenup be the good there be

that be correct
not to blow i own
horn but they devote an entire
semester to it at harvard law

harvard
whoa daddy

i just want to make sure that you
both

understand what you be asking for
here
the massey prenup provide
that in the event of a dissolution
of the marriage for any reason both
party shall leave it with whatever
they bring in and earned during
no one can profit from the marriage
the prenup protect the wealthy
party

well at the moment that would be i

and without it that party be exposed
a sitting duck
no wriggle room

wriggle room
maybe we should put
that in the malibu house
screw the
screen room

and we be sure

we be both sure that be what we
want

absolutely

course i can not do much wriggling
if you tie i up like that again
massey this be one bad bad little
girl

we would well go before we get throw
out
