i would still like to see you

and jumping into fountain naked
good night


miss daniels
be that you



yes

hi
be something wrong
be that cut
beginning to bother you

no it be not the cut that be bother
i

would you like some brandy

if you have some i would

i will get it sit down miss daniels
do you want a sweater or something
quilt

no thank you
will not you call i melanie

all right

thank you

it get a little chilly here at night
sometimes
especially if you be over
near the bay

well how do you evening go

do you meet lydia

or would you rather i changed the
subject

i think so

how do you like we little hamlet

i despise it

well i do not suppose it offer much
to the casual visitor
unless you be
thril by a collection of shack
on a hillside
it take a while to
get used to

where be you from originally annie

san francisco

how do you happen to come here

oh someone invited i up for the
weekend a long time ago

look i see no reason for be coy
about this
it be mitch brenner

i guess you know that anyway

i suspected as much

you need not worry
it be over and
do with
long time ago

annie there be nothing between
mitch and i

be not there
maybe there be not
maybe there be
never anything between mitch and any
girl

what do you mean

i think i will have some of that too
she pour brandy
drink sigh
i be seeing quite a lot of he in
san francisco you know
and then one weekend he ask i
up to meet lydia

when be this

four year ago
of course that be
shortly after he father die
thing
may be different now

different

with lydia
do she seem a trifle distant

trifle

then maybe it be not different at
all
you know she attitude nearly
drive i crazy
i simply could not
understand it

when i get back to san francisco i
spend day trying to figure out just
what i would do to displease she

and what have you do

nothing
i simply exist
so what
be the answer
jealous woman
right
cling possessive mother
wrong
with all due respect to
oedipus i do not think that be the
case at all

then what be it

lydia liked i you see
that be
the strange part of it
in fact now
that i be no longer a threat we be
very good friend

then why do she object to you

because she be afraid

afraid you would take mitch

afraid i would give mitch

i do not understand

afraid of any woman who give mitch
the only thing lydia can give he
love

annie that add up to a jealous
possessive woman

no i do not think so
she be not afraid
of losing she son you see
she be
only afraid of be abandoned

someone ought to tell she she would be
gain a daughter

she already have a daughter

what about mitch
do not he have
anything to say about this

i can understand he position
he
go through a lot with lydia after
he father die
he do not want to
risk going through it all over again

i see

so it end
not immediately of
course
i go back to san francisco
and i still see mitch every now and
then
but we both know it be
finished

then what be you do here in bodega
bay

you get straight to the point do not
you

i be sorry
forgive i

no that be all right i do not mind
i come up here for two reason
to
begin with i be bore with i job
in san francisco

and the second

i wanted to be near mitch

about what

well

all

still a little
hesitant
all right i will grant you a bird
panic in an enclose room
but they
do not just get in
they come in
right down that chimney

trying to make sense
of this
i wife find a bird in the back
seat of she car once

do not know how he get in there
have a break leg turned out
just
fluttering all around there

these bird be

some gull come down at the child
and miss daniels be attack by a
gull just yesterday after

kind of disturbance near they they will
just come after you
i see that
plenty of time myself

the child be playing a game
al
those gull attack without

now lydia attack be a pretty
strong word do not you think

people without no reason you know
what i mean
the kid just probably
scare they that be all

these bird attack

well what would you like i to do
lydia
put out a pick up and hold on
any suspicious bird in the area
now that would be pretty silly would not
it

do this room look silly

no you get quite a mess here i will
admit that
maybe you oughta put some screen
on top of you chimney
seem a little pointless though
freak accident like this would not
happen again in a million year
you want some help cleaning up

i can handle it myself

i will take cathy up to bed

be you staying

i think i should do not you

for it


mitch
mitch

fawcett farm
do you need anything
in town

mitch

Cheecheecheecheechee

i wanted to change i shirt

it smell of the fire

it be hard to believe anything at all
happen yesterday be not it
it be
so beautiful and still now
pause
then sagely
i think i have get it all figure out
by the way

really
tell i about it

it be an uprising

of bird

certainly of bird

it all start several month ago
with a peasant sparrow up in the
hill a malcontent
he go around
telling all the other sparrow that
human being be not fit to rule
this planet preaching wherever anyone
would listen

growing a beard

yes of course he have to have a
beard
bird of the world unite

he keep saying over and over

so they united

not at first
oh yes a few sparrow
out for kick

well they will go along with anything

sure
but eventually even the more
seriousminded bird begin to listen
why should human rule
they ask
themselves

hear

why should we submit ourselves to
they domination

hear hear

and all the while that sparrow be
get in he little message
bird of the world unite

take wing

you have nothing to lose but you
feather

attempting to be
serious
what it be probably

mmm

they be probably hungry that be all
this be a bad summer
they eat
berry and
and nut you know
and the hill be all burned out so
they be probably searching for food
wherever they can get it

with i little sparrow leading team

it be so damn quiet out there

it be like that yesterday

what do you mean

after the gull attack

i have not think of that
and then the swift come

it make you feel as if they be
they be waiting or
resting
or

trying to make it
light again
no they be have a meet melanie
you sparrow be standing on a soap
box and

waving he little wing

they be angry mitch

and every one of we dead

these be not a few bird

i do not even know there be many
crow in bodega bay this time of
year


the crow be a permanent resident
throughout it range
in fact during
we christmas count we recorded

suddenly from his
table
how many gull do you count mrs
bundy


which gull mr
Sholes
there be
several variety

the one that be raising the
devil with i fish boat


probably herring gull
they arrive
in november you know and do not
migrate north again until march or

have you have trouble with gull

the child

timmy have a canary

that be nice
be you timmy

i cousin be timmy

leaving table coming
to bar
whole flock of gull nearby capsize
one of i boat
practically tear
of the skipper arm

you be scaring the kid
keep it
low

you be scaring i too
be you trying
to say all these
that sound impossible sebastian

i be only telling you what happen
to i boat


the gull be after you fish mr
Sholes
really let we be logical
about this

what be the crow after at the
school


what do you think they be after
miss

daniels
i think they be after the
child


for what purpose

to
to kill they


why

i do not know why


i think not
bird have be on
this planet since archaeopteryx
miss daniels
a hundred and twenty
million year ago


do not it seem odd that they would wait
all that time to start a
a war
against humanity

no one called it a war

scotch light on the water


you and mr
Sholes seem to be imply
as much

be you finished here sebastian

let i have some apple pie helen
to mrs
bundy
who said anything about war
all i
said be that some gull

one apple pie
you want more coffee

no

come down on one of i boat
they could have be after the fish
just as you said

you captain should have shoot at
they

what

gull be scavenger anyway
most
bird be
if you ask i we should
wipe they all out
world would be
well off without they


bird

yeah bird
all they do be make a
mess of everything
who need they


we need they

not if they be starting a war


they be incapable of organized
warfare

have you ever see a jay protecting
a nest


i have see jay do everything it
be conceivable for jay to do
ornithology happen to be i
avocation miss daniels
you be
talking about preservation of the
species a hen protecting she young
there be a vast difference between

maybe they be all protecting the
species
maybe they be tire of be
shoot at and roast in oven and


be you discuss gamebird now
all bird be not gamebird you
know

i do not know anything about bird
except that they be attack this
town

then fight back
get yourselves gun
and wipe they off the face of the
earth


that would hardly be possible

why not mrs
bundy


because there be species of
bird in the world today mr
carter
it be estimated that five billion
seven hundred and fifty million bird
live in the united states alone
the
five continent of the world

kill they all
get rid of they
messy animal


probably contain more than a
hundred billion bird

it be the end of the world

well we seem to have more than we
share of they right now mrs
bundy
maybe this young lady right
maybe
they have all go crazy

here you pie sebastian
you want
it at the table

where be the bloody marys Deke

coming

be we running a business here or
a bird sanctuary

beginning to change
he mind
actually those gull must have be
after the fish


of course

make a lot more sense than
well
an attack


of course it do
if we believe
that bird be attack why
why
next we will believe that grasshopper
and cockroach be capable of

cockroach
Urghh

maybe we be all get a little
carry away by this

reason to believe

i keep telling
you that
these be gull and swift
and crow and


and what
vulture
hawk
eagle

maybe
be it impossible
