the book of the live contained
sacred incantation that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the
dark underworld

the slave be killed

and the soldier who killed they
be also slain so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site

but there be another book the book
of the dead which be never to be
open never to be read for it
contained the incantation that could
bring a dead body back to life a
most unholy thing
city of the dead

it be hidden at Hamunaptra city of
the dead inside the statue of anubis
so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace egypt

but for i love of Ancksunamun i
be will to defy the god

Ancksunamuns vital organ be
still fresh so a human sacrifice
would not need be make

Ancksunamun soul have come back

they would never allow i to be
released
for i would arise a walk
disease a plague upon mankind an
unholy flesheater with the strength
of age power over the sand and
the glory of invincibility

here

you will not believe it

try i

we be part of an ancient secret
society the cultoftheMumia and
we have a sacred mission passed
down through thirtynine generation
for over four thousand year we have
guarded the city of the dead
we be
sworn at manhood to do any and all
in we power to stop the high priest
imhotep from be reborn into this
world

and because of you we have failed

and you think this justify killing
innocent people

to have stopped this creature
yes

okay let we cut to the chase
he be
afraid of cat what be that about

accord to the ancient cates be
the guardian at the gate of the
underworld
imhotep will fear they
until he be fully regenerate and
then he will fear nothing

right
and you know how he get fully
regenerate
by killing everybody
who opened that chest and sucking we
dry
that be how

yes the creature must first try and
regenerate and then he will attempt
to resurrect the one he have loved
for more than four thousand year

Ancksunamun

in the necropolis when i see he
alive
walking he called i Anck
sunamun
and then in mister burns
quarter he tried to kiss i

it be because it be you who read
from the book
he have chosen you to
be the human sacrifice needed to
regenerate the body of Ancksunamun

this be not good
not good at all

tonight be the full moon
the moon
of osiris
it will begin tonight


and he stretched forth he hand
towards the heaven and there be
darkness throughout the land of
egypt


we must stop he from regenerate

who opened that chest

well there be i and daniels here
and then poor burn of course oh
yeah and that egyptologist fella

what about i buddy beni

naw he scrammed outta there

we must find the egyptologist and
bring he back here to the safety of
the fort before the creature can
get to he

okay
evelyn you wait here you
two come with i

the hell with that
i be not going
nowhere
we be safe here

yeah i be not leavin this fort for
nothing

who put you in charge

for this mess and i intend to be the
one to clean it up

with this creep beni
what be in it
for you

it be good to be the right hand of
the devil
than in he path
as
long as i serve he i be immune

immune from what

you shall see

what be you looking for
lie and
i will slit you throat

the book
the black book they find
at Hamunaptra
imhotep want it back
say to i it would be worth it be
weight in diamond

what do he want the book for

something about bringing he dead
girlyfriend back to life
he need
the book
and you sister

that look rather painful

you know ever since i meet you i
luck have be for crap

yes i know i do that to people

Damnit
that be two down and only
two to go

and then he will be coming after Evy

ten of the clock
all be well

the hell with this
i be goin
downstairs to get i a drink
you
want something

yeah get i a glass of bourbon a
shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser

get you hand off i girl pal

nice lip

i figure you might be here so i
bring a friend

you called i you girl

what
oh yeah that be just um
you know figure a speech

i think you be jealous

jealous
you kiddin i
do you see
that guy face

Shutup

we get to do
something
we get to do somethin

before it be too late

last month i come across an
inscription that mention the book
of the dead

that book we find at Hamunaptra

yes
i dismissed it because it talk
about bringing people back from the
dead
notion i be unwilling to
believe

believe it sister
that be what
bring we buddy back to life

and now he be going to use it to bring
he girlfriend back

and if he succeed the two of they
together will bring about the
apocalypse

the plague we have see so far be
merely imhotep flexing he muscle
only at the moment of Ancksunamuns
resurrection will he be truly
invincible

i be think that if the black book
of the dead can bring people back to
life

then perhaps the golden book of
the live can return they to the
underworld

exactly

so you sayin if we find the book
make outta gold

and read the sacred incantation
contained inside it

you think it will send this guy back
to hell

correct and that be when

it have begin
the begin of the
end

not quite yet it have not
mon

get it

get what

since the black book of the dead be
find inside the statue of anubis
then accord to this the golden
book of the live should be inside

what

what



the golden book of the live be
inside the statue of horus

which would be locate not far to
the east of the anubis statue

do not tell i we get to go back out
there

if we want to kill the creature
yes

Ancksunamun
Ancksunamun

imhotep


you be going to get yours pal

mon
mon
let we go
let we go

he be gorgeous

he have consummated the curse now
all he need do be raise Ancksunamun
from the dead then it will be the
end of we and the begin for
they

Koontash dai na

take he hand and he will spare the
other

any bright idea
