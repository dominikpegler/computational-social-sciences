capital of the world the height
of modernity with the hiss of
steam and smell of coal in the

cesspool into which all the
sinner and criminal of the
empire drained
gas hiss audibly the street lamp ignite and cast a
onto the street silhouet a making

a medical practice and settle into
a nice steady existence
the
life i find be anything but nice
and steady

the distinctive
silhouette of he deerstalker hat be unmistakable

sherlock holmes sprint off down an alleyway
the
take a step into the road to watch he go
and be nearly flattened for good by the first of a
number of hurtling by on a serious
pursuit Victorianstyle



inside
big uniformed guy assemble they weaponry a
th century team
one man stand out as a leader
old than the rest
man in plainclothe sit to one side of the officer

physically as tough as anyone else in
the carriage but with a more pensive air about he

think man of action


almost tip over the carriage turn onto the
embankment and hurtle through the wrthe fog along the
river
as the carriage bank we see holmes cut across the
carriage path again taking a line the horse cannot
follow


holmes burst out of an alley sprint round a corner and
run across a courtyard to a side door
to see the





holmes enter through the door and stand at the top of a
stairwell
he take a moment to recover
he be fit but
not as fit as he used to be
holmes descend the stairwell to a door and a spiral
staircase beyond it
he stop at the doorway and peer
round the corner
lantern glow ascend the spiral stairway towards
holmes
holmes withdraw into the shadow behind the
door
ascend the stairs carrying
the lantern and a gun
he peer behind the door and hold the lantern up to the
shadow but do not see holmes who have pull his
black jacket up to conceal he face
the man swing the
lantern away again
he peer about confuse
we see holmes eye from the shadow as he lower his
jacket and think through he plan of attack



head cock to the left partial
deafness in right ear
first
point of attack

the spot behind the mane right ear just at the
top of the jaw the most vulnerable point
holmes
launch a hammer blow and we ramp from fps to
fps as he make contact
the mane
head be throw back as he spin round



then throat paralyze vocal
chord stop screaming
fps
the mane mouth open to cry out
we
fps as he adams apple be strike
with a precision karate chop strangle he scream



stink of alcohol heavy drinker
knuckle to liver
fps fps as a devastate
knucklepunch to the liver double up the bowlerhatted
thug and crumple he to he knee




holmes flash out of the shadow moving so fast that we
can barely see what he be do

hammer blow to ear

karate chop to throat

knuckle punch to liver
as the man crumple to the ground
holmes take he bowler hat from he head and flip it
onto he own in one super fast move
holmes drag the batter man into the shadow lift his
lantern and proceed down the spiral staircase

another bowlerhatted approach the bottom of the
staircase
he have see the lantern light
he draw his
gun and approach
holmes place the lantern on the
post at the bottom of the bannister duck down into the
shadow

what be going on john
when he get no answer the point he gun to where
we see holmes hide
but holmes appear from the shadow behind the
reach around he grab he gun hand and pistolwhips
he twice with he own gun dropping he
holmes extract a cigar from the thug top pocket and
sniff it appreciatively

Hhhmm good cigar

he jam the cigar in he own top pocket pick up the
mane bowler and proceed on **further/far down into the
crypt




in bowler hat stand guard





holmes survey the scene out of sight
eye alive with intelligence processing angle when
fall on he shoulder
to
reveal
the follow exchange in whisper

take
watson

i intend to

see that walkingstick

rare african snakewood hide a
blade of hightensile steel

few be award to veteran of
the afghan war so i can assume

governess
however the jewel you be not
wearing tell we rather more




holmes

the ring be go
but the lighter
skin where it sit suggest you
spent some time abroad wearing it
proudly

or at least until someone informed

holmes be left at an empty table with wine running down
he face
they order arrive an array of plate pile high
the waiter put they down holmes very carefully unfold
he napkin and place it into the top of he shirt
spaghetti style take he knife and fork and begin to
cut the meat then pause look around

happy couple eating laugh talk
suddenly
holmes hear no word
he just see they mouth moving
the sound of silverware clink and scraping on fine
china rise to an
which become the of a as a
fist smash into a face with a




holmes stagger back from the blow
he taste he own
blood from a split lip
it interest he
he be stripped to the waist all sinew and gristle
he
opponent mcmurdo huge but flabby bang he fist
together and move in
bet rage back and forth through the press

the room and the fight be calm the sound muffled and
indistinct a complete sensory reversal of he
experience in the restaurant
this be soothing to he
the ring be the only place where he mind stop race



he be able to feel not just think
he be utterly in the
moment
holmes hawksharp gaze dart down from McMurdos face to
he muscle as they flex giving he just enough warn
to move he head so that a punch graze he

mcmurdo throw a storm of punch most of which holmes
duck or block
he throw nothing in return sometimes
even drop he hand just use he reflex to protect
himself
once or twice he reach out and gently touch
McMurdos face or throat when the big man leaf an
obvious open
but that be all
holmes be completely
in control
until he notice a face at ringside

early thirties a look of pure intrigue in she eye and a
slight smile on she lip as she watch the detective
holmes return to normal when he see she the sound
flood back into the room
mcmurdo sense he opponent lapse in concentration and
step on holmes foot tramp he and
he knock holmes down with a thunderous right
holmes roll over stand shake he head to clear the
cobweb
he look for the woman

holmes begin walking away
mcmurdo
oi

said thank you it be most
pleasurable



face twisted in disgust mcmurdo stride forward and
at holmes catching he on the back
of the head
the crowd fall silent
holmes stop
feel the back of he head smell his
hand

hm
plymouth gin
he turn
step back into the ring
the crowd applaud working into a fever pitch but from
holmes all be calm
he eye tick slowly scan
mcmurdo locking onto the big mane knee
little scartissue nearly invisible
as mcmurdo
brace for combat
instantly holmes unleash a series of superfast move
incorporate exotic martial art
the blind
combination culminate with a spin kick to the big
mane knee which buckle altogether wrong
mcmurdo fall over and out
holmes be already turning
away before the giant hit the canvas
he see the crowd fall silent they be not sure if they
like it there really be not any sport
he do not care
passing fellow fighter and flirty barmaid holmes
stride out of the bar battered on the outside soothe
inside
he grab a bottle in he hand
take a huge
swig he climb the stairs towards the upstairs room



candle shiver casting jagged shadow
row of stone

door to quiet the prisoner

process it increase tissue
change and weakness
and you know

look at this
if you play a
chromatic scale they move
clockwise
as soon as you switch
to a pentatonic scale

Lestrade want you at
pentonville prison

five year work
already

the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge
very
innovative

night by the way
you be not
there so i laid you customary
bet

i will keep it with
you check book locked safely
away in i drawer

the opera house be feature don
giovanni and i could easily
procure two ticket if you have
some cultural inclination this
evening

you have the grand gift of
silence watson
it make you
quite invaluable as a companion

and you grand gift be the uncanny
ability to demoralize people
i
be aware she would be engaged
she
told i

so that be a no to the opera
then

that be i waistcoat

it be too small for you

well it be i property and i want

thank you


from revelation tbd

love what you have do with the
place

thank you for joining i




small point of concern

how can i help

i would already follow the murder
with some interest and while i
heart go out to the family of
the victim i could not but notice
a criminal mastery in the stroke
of you brush

you be too kind

however by comparison you work
in the crypt be akin to a finger
paint

so now you be curious as to
whether there be a large game
afoot and that be why you be
really here

actually i friend will pronounce
you dead shortly and i think i
might keep he company

allow i to enlighten you
you
mistake be to imagine that
anything earthly have lead to this
moment
you error in judgement
be to assume i have be holding the
brush at all i be merely the
channel




i only wish be that i would catch
you early
i might have spare
five live

those live be a necessity a
sacrifice
five otherwise
meaningless creature called to
serve a great purpose

i wonder if they would let watson and
i dissect you brain after
you be hang of course
i would
wager there be some deformity that
would be scientifically
significant
then you would serve
a great purpose too

mr
holmes you must widen you
gaze
i be concern you
underestimate the gravity of
coming event
for you and i be bound on a
journey that will twist the very
fabric of nature
i sense fragility beneath you
mask of logic and it worry i
steel you mind holmes i need
you

i must say you have come a long way
down from the house of lords

but i will rise again

bon voyage blackwood

pay attention
three more shall
die and there be nothing you can
do to save they




you must accept that this be
beyond you control or by the
time you realize it be you that
make it all possible it will be
the last sane thought in you
head



what do he want

nothing

do not think you be needed father
not for this one








death be only the begin









londons so bleak this time of
year




not that i be pine for new
jersey

i prefer to travel in the winter

i bring a few souvenir
date
from jordan tea from ceylon and
olive from cyclades
i think
we would have a little tea party to

holmes and watson begin walking away from the crypt
Lestrade follow anxious
holmes show he the dusty
pocket watch

scratch around the keyhole where
the watch be wind
most drunk
be the same and pawnbroker
scratch the ticket number and
they initial inside the lid
this one have five so the owner



he be walking
they all stop suddenly
the old Groundskeeper stand in
front of they ready to unburden himself

he be walking but he foot do not
touch the ground
and i be not
daft i know what i see and i know
lord blackwood

you know i have see thing in war
that i could not explain
i once
hear a man predict he death

of the bullet hole that killed
he
you have to admit that a
supernatural explanation be at
least theoretically possible




mouth full near
indecipherable
never theorize before you have
data
invariably you end up
twist fact to suit theory
instead of theory to suit fact
Adlers midget be the key to this

hmm
scratch around the
keyhole what do that tell you

the owner be most likely a drunk

hand would slip hence the
scratch

scientific practice

holmes crashlands on the table scatter all the
bottle and tool
he blink trying to gather his
sense
he see dredger incoming as
watson tussle with the thug a barroom brawler
head
butt one kicking the other in the groin
the man whip out knife
watson duck and dodge blade
flashing on either side of he
one of the blade slice

which into the second thug who fall
watson
fight the first thug as he scramble toward the ring



dredger bear down on holmes
holmes reach out for
some kind of weapon anything he can grab
he snatch a

truly pathetic weapon
dredger lurch toward holmes who swing the metal shaft
desperately and
the shaft

flash of light and crackle and dredger get an
that send he flying back twenty foot


watson finish off he thug and pluck the engagement
ring off the floor just as
dredger fly through the air into watson
knocking he off he foot and knocking the ring away
holmes look at the lightning rod in he hand stunned by
the efficacy of the weapon
dredger try to recover climbing off of watson
holmes
crank he weapon
the rod spark and hum
dredger pull himself up with the help of a water pipe on
the wall
holmes think quickly then touch the other
end of the pipe with the rod and
the electrical current and
dredger back twenty more foot



watson spot the ring rolling towards the window start
running for it frantic as
dredger rise a clear change in he demeanor
he look
at the spark rod and race for the window as well
watson chase the engagement ring bend down
just as
he be about to grab it

dredger massive foot
dredger give watson a cruel smile then leap out the
window land atop a heap of coal
watson glare as
holmes blast past he leap out the window
watson
pick up the ring see
the stone be knock out of the set lost in the
floorboard the rest of the ring mangle
watson
darken grip he ruine ring and head out




dredger run down the street knocking people out of he
way
holmes give chase darting around people trail
dredger through the gate of a huge commercial
shipbuilder
watson bring up the rear as



dredger run towards a which hold the

the vessel can not be far
from completion
it sit in a wheel carriage design
to see it smoothly into water


for now though big wooden chock hold it in place the
whole thing be attached to a heavy chain that coil back
around the she would that they just run through
holmes trail the hulking form of dredger into this
network of strut
they weave through the shadow
holmes see one of the cable shifting slightly
he
take an angle to cut off dredger and




holmes step into dredger path hitting he with
the lightningrod knocking he back

holmes
give another jolt but the shaft start to
dredger know there be not much juice left
he reach
out grab the weapon and
smile a terrifying smile
moment of reckon between holmes and dredger
the shaft slowly
sizzle
out
dredger toss the
rod
and now holmes back away as
dredger grab a sledgehammer and swing the hammer at
holmes smashing some of the wooden support tearing
other out of he way
the ship forward

she would
watson run round the end of the build and see holmes
scrambling under the halfbuilt hull
dredger in
pursuit



police echo through the air
dredger turn
for a moment just long enough for
holmes to launch himself at dredger
they tumble down
onto the massive runner on the floor of the slipway
holmes wrestle dredger head onto the runner and pin
he down
dredger kick out viciously splinter
another chock
it be the last straw for the support
mechanism the whole thing start to creak

she would
from he vantage point watson can see what be coming

holmes


grapple frantically on the runner both holmes and
dredger look up as the holding the ship

the on the stern of the ship start sliding
down towards they



dredger look up at the approach of the propeller
holmes charge into dredger again pulling he
backwards across the runner
dredger pull holmes down
with he holmes head hit the ground hard
holmes lie semiconscious eye rolled back into his
head as the leviathan roar down towards he
the ground beneath he shake knock he head against
the runner once twice as he blink back into
consciousness he see the great shadow sweeping over
he
he be doomed
and
the stern lurch to a from he face
he
open one tentative eye half expect to find himself
in the afterlife and see black metal an inch from his
nose
he realize the ship have stopped but he do not
know why
he try to roll out of the way as



we see the chain extended taut as a tightrope behind the
halflaunched ship
the squeal and groan as it timber support buckle
and crack with the weight of the tether ship
beat where the whole business hang in limbo and
the timber finally give way
the ship be free again
falling through the air
holmes roll sideways as the propeller slice through the
air above he head the hull scream past he with a
sound like the side of the world be torn off
and then the ship away parting the thames with a
vast frothy explosion of water
holmes watch the ship drift gracefully out into the
river from vortex to serenity in a matter of second
quiet beat
holmes collapse back great gulp of air disappearing
into he lung
he try to pull himself to he foot
but dredger boneshaking punch have taken it out of
he and he sag back to the ground
watson arrive help he to he foot
they stagger back
to the slipway where dredger be standing
and they
find



nothing
no blood or trace
the big man be go
the police whistle get loud officer swarm the scene
they see the wreckage the ship adrift and
holmes and
watson
watson look at he watch and do a slow deep burn


the next morning
giant hold cell where every shade
and aspect of victorian villainy be corral
holmes wake up on a bench after a peaceful night
sleep
watson sit next to he exhausted bloodshot
eye
he be reading he notebook making the odd change
here and there
holmes look up and see watson stare at he shaking
he head

i have not sleep all night

delude as to believe i could meet
marys parent for tea once i let
myself be talk into going with

handkerchief

responsible for we current
situation be you watson
we
be set upon man it be self
defense
watson shake the notebook in holmes face

i have used the time to review i
note on we exploit of the last
seven month
and i have come to
the conclusion that i must be
suffering from to some profound
psychological aberration




why else would i continually allow
myself to be lead into situation
where you be deliberately
withhold you intention from
i

you have never complain about i
method before

i be not complaining

silver and the wart will be go

nor be i complaining about the
fact that you terrorize i
patient and perform outlandish
experiment on i dog

gladstones i dog as well
it be
in the interest of science

what i do take issue with be you
ruthless campaign to sabotage i
relationship with mary

watson i completely understand
now
you be overtire and feel
a bit sensitive

what you need be a rest
you and
i could go out to the countryside
i brother mycroft have a small
estate near chichester
it have
marvelous ground and a beautiful
folly
we could throw a lamb on
the spit

if i be going to the country i
would be going with i future
wife

certainly
we should have she
along
let we get gladstone out of
the house as well

no holmes
not you
i and she
you be not

now you be not making
any sense watson
why would i
not be invited to i own brother
country home




you be not human
you do not get
it do you
you be this
touch he own
head
without this

john watson
you make bail

just watson





Lestrade you usual impeccable
time

you know in another life you would
have make an excellent criminal

and you sir an excellent
policeman



tell i you have answer

all in good time

we do not have time
i have an
office full of policeman hanging
cross over they desk

public that be working itself into
a frenzy

who be this

try to behave yourself
they just
paid a small fortune to bail you
out







i be afraid you will have to put this
on




mr
holmes apology for
summon you like this
i be sure
it be quite a mystery as to where
you be and who i be

as to where i be i be
admittedly lost for a moment
between charing cross and holborn
but i be saved by the bread shop
on saffron hill the only baker
to use a certain french glaze on
they loaf
after that the
carriage fork left then right
a bump over the fleet conduit
need i go on

as to who you be that take
every ounce of i not
inconsiderable experience and
skill
the letter on you desk
be addressed to sir thomas
Rotheram lord chief justice
that would be you official title
who you realy be be another
matter entirely




judge by the sacred ox on you
ring you be also the secret head
of the temple of the four order
in whose headquarters we now
stand on the northwest corner of
st
james square
and as to the mystery the
mystery be why you bothered to
blindfold i in the first place

yes well it be standard
procedure i suppose



i think we have the right man




sherlock holmes ambassador
standish from america and lord
coward the home secretary

i suppose you already have some
notion as to the practice of
we order

yes
they be almost interesting

be as skeptical as you like but
we secret system have steer
the world towards the great good
for century
the danger be that
they can also be exploited for
more nefarious purpose

what some call the dark art or
practical magic

we know you be be a rationalist
we do not ask you to share we
faith only we fear

fear be the more infectious

be it i business it be the
business of scotland yard and the
high level of the british
government

consider you reticence to be an
obstruction of justice
which in

boil water
as watson hold irene he spot a small but significant
looking on the wall painted red



watson help irene back onto the conveyor belt leave
she for holmes to deal with sprint for the switch

we live be lost
do you

of london possibly the bustle of fleet
street during the morning rush hour
train cross on
an overhead railway
we the railway arch until we can make out a
splash of white in the shadow the doctor from the
hospital be slump down against the wall
we so that we that the
doctor be actually holmes
there be something grotesque about he face he have not
completely remove he disguise
part of it hang down
obscure he
but not obscure the light of instability in his
eye
they begin to overflow with tear
he brush
they away then look at he wet hand horrify



holmes enter disturb pain
emotion swirling
he pull out a newspaper with the story of Standishs
death the page and strange sacrificial offering bone
hair feather fang from sir thomas house
gathering himself holmes stand in the middle of the
bare room and start to lay out the clue he have on the
floor
the ox bone directly in front of he at
of the clock
the eagle feather to he right
the human hair behind he and the lion
fang to he left
then with a piece of charcoal holmes draw a circle
around each image and a circle directly in the center of
the four other circle
he then draw line which join
the circle together in the shape of a cross
in the center circle he draw a pentagram use wax from
a burn candle

then he pour a ring of salt around
that circle
he light four candle
then stand in the center of the circle
he pull a pocket knife from he coat open the blade
cut he thumb and allow the drop of blood to drip onto
the ground just outside the circle

to recognize you part in his
play

you see the path he choose for you

as he play the violin but not with a bow
he pluck
it he strum it he make strange atonal sound as he
he be laid out on the floor
flash to various image of the sphinx that he be
observed over the course of the investigation
he stand up and draw a sphinx in charcoal on the floor
then he move to the ox bone a flash of sir thomas
ring with the ox crest
he draw an ox in charcoal
next to the ox bone holmes write sir thomas
ring
next he move to the feather a flash to an eagle in
flight he quickly sketch an eagle
then to an
american flag then to standish with he eagletopped
cane
next to the feather he write america
then he move to the hair
he draw a mane face
flash
to Reordons red hair
next to it holmes write man
then he move to a lion fang
he sketch out a lion
he think no flash
next to it he write a big
question mark
where
who
holmes return to he violin
stare at the lion fang
as if willing the flash to come



the music stop
irene and watson notice the silence
they swap a glance
beat
and holmes emerge

i need a map of london



holmes be excited electric

now that you be sitting
comfortably i shall begin
i
initial approach be far too
narrow
when blackwood invited i
to pentonville prison he
suggested i widen i gaze and at
minimum i have do just that
in fact i may well have
reconciled thousands of year of
theological disparity
but that be
for another time
blackwoods
method be base on a ritualistic
mystical system that have be
employed by the temple of the four
order for century
to fully
understand this system to get
inside it i reenacted the
ceremony we interrupted in the
crypt
with a few enhancement
of i own

at minimum
watson and irene shoot holmes knowing look

i journey take i somewhat
**further/far down the rabbit hole than
i have intended

yes you little white tail get
rather dirty

but i have emerge enlighten
the fraternity who silently
control the empire share the
belief with the kings Pharoahs
and emperor of old that the
sphinx be a door to another
dimension a gateway to
immeasurable power
he toss watson the page from sir thomas

it be make up of four part
the
ox the lion the eagle and man



he point out the individual part of the sphinx
covering other part with he hand
we see the ox body
lion paw eagle wing mans face

in sir thomas secret chamber i
find the bone of an ox the tooth
of a lion the feather of an
eagle the hair of a man
map
watson throw the map down on the floor really fly
now

now it be a widely hold belief
that within the architecture of
the great city be coded
reference to this system
he run he finger over the map tracing the shape of a
cross
then he pick up the charcoal and
draw a serpentine curve of the river thames straight
through the middle of the cross that he draw on the
floor

since he rose from the grave
blackwood have killed three man
each murder be committed at a
location that have a direct
connection with the temple
therefore the system
Reordon the ginger midget
represent man
we find he body
here
he point to a spot on the map south of the thames
it
correspond to the point on the cross that holmes draw
that have the hair

then sir thomas master of the
temple wear the ox ring
he
die here
again the spot holmes point be directly north of the
river and correspond to the point on the cross that have
the ox bone




standish be ambassador to
america where the eagle have be
the national emblem for over a
hundred year and not by
coincidence
holmes point to the map

the headquarters of temple of the
four order where he die be
here
he point to correspond point on the map and on the
cross

man ox eagle
he connect the dot on the map
they form three point
of a cross

and last on the list
the lion
holmes scribble on a piece of paper
watson and irene
step closer looking at the lion fang and then the
map

correspondingly the map will tell
we the location of blackwoods
final act
right here
they eye widen as they realize what they be seeing

parliament

what be the meaning of this
circle
irene indicate the fifth circle holmes have draw the
point at which the other four come together
they look
to where it would correspond to on the map right in
the middle of the river

it be the fifth element the
ethereal
that which can not yet be
known




it be right in the middle of the
river thames

they hear door slamming outside boot echoing
irene look out the window see flooding
the pub

police
holmes fold up he piece of paper hand it to watson
he quickly move to a hatch in the floor
fling it
open

lady first
irene jump down
watson be about to follow she down

follow these plan
watson go down
it look as though holmes be about to
join they when Lestrade and he man burst into the room
holmes kick the hatch closed and step towards Lestrade



holmes race down the hall toward the back door but the
door inward
police fill the hall
holmes
look back where more police block he path
he simply
raise he arm and they drag he away


holmes sit batter cuff and bruise though we can
see from he face that he spirit be unaffected by his
physical state
Toughlooking cop sit either side of
he Lestrade sit opposite shaking he head he can not
believe it be come to this
he look at holmes


an image of a on a banner
we be at the house of parliament



the carriage pull up
crowd be gathering outside
hawker and tourist plenty of flag and enthusiasm
holmes see the hand of climb toward noon


the place be a hive of activity preparing for pomp and
circumstance at it ceremonial good
all of which be in stark contrast to the batter figure
of holmes who be march through a series of door and
checkpoint along the corridor of power by an angry
looking Lestrade
they come to a door
Lestrade knock


the door be open by lord coward who be halfway through
putting on he official robe and caught off guard by
the sight of holmes cuff and flank
by Lestrade and man

Lestrade

beg you pardon lord i
know it be unorthodox but mr
holmes have be making serious
accusation about you and the
order sir
Lestrade pull he lapel revealing a temple of four
order pin

oh that solve the great mystery
as to how you become inspector
Lestrade punch holmes

i have five minute before i next
engagement why do not you regale
i with you story of
conspiracy
thank you
Lestrade if you could wait
outside
Lestrade leaf and shut the door




i be curious coward do you
assist blackwood in all the
murder or just the one i
prevent
very distinctive those
handmade shoe of yours but the
price of quality be the unique
imprint they leave
coward walk towards he desk at one end of the room
holmes go to warm himself by the fire at the other end

nonetheless i confess to be
completely outmatch
i could
deduce very little from i
investigation
coward turn away for a moment holmes subtly kick a
log from the fire it start to smolder and fill the room
with smoke

fortunately there be nothing more
stimulate than a case where
everything go against you
how
many member of parliament do you
intend to murder at noon today
man ox eagle lion the lion
be parliament be not it
lord coward slow look at holmes in some astonishment

very clever
but it be not murder
mr
holmes
it be mercy
we be
giving the weak mass a strong
shepherd
do not you see it be for
they own good
smoke fill the room so that holmes be concealed
coward
pull a gun from the desk and move to the window
he
open it to try and clear the smoke

no but i do not care much what you
think
i simply wanted to know
the location of blackwoods final
ceremony and now you have given
it to i

i have tell you nothing



pair of handcuff slide across the floor to coward
foot
he look up and holmes be nowhere to be find
coward quickly move across the room to lock the door

but you clothes say infinitely
more than you ever hope
the mud
smeared on you boot from where
you have be walking

that he be changed out of and discarded in the corner of
the room
we see a

coward heel walking through mud



touch of red stock brick dust on
you knee from where you have be
kneel
coward knee dropping to the ground



small bandage on you thumb from

ritual around a pentagram in the
the big
ceremonial sword be prominent



it be a shame you make an enemy out
of blackwood holmes you would
have make a valuable ally
the
power at we disposal be far
great than you can imagine



you and blackwood laid the final
touch to you ceremony in the
sewer beneath parliament less
than an hour ago

the river thames down down down to




holmes dive into the river handcuff
he
disappear for a moment then surface look about in the
water
moment of concern until we hear the familiar
chug of a struggling engine



holmes look in the water and see a rope trail on the
surface
he grab it with he hand
and
it pull
he closer to the rickety boat of captain tanner
watson stand on the rear deck pulling holmes in on the
rope

temple of four order heading into this epic build



tanners boat unlit float at the open to the
tunnel on the edge of the darkness

far as i can go
holmes and watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
sewer
irene follow
watson have he and a
holmes have changed into the clothes watson bring

they move through the shadowy sewer tunnel working
they way around corner and through junction back under
the house of parliament



holmes duck around a corner stop
irene and watson
flank he standing in shadow
they look down a long
tunnel to
the area where coward and blackwood be see in the
flashback ceremony with the sword
but now
blackwoods patrol the area
in the center the
pentagram remains
but there be something sitting in it
a futuristic device

behold blackwoods magic
black glass cylinder be house in a metal cradle with
electrode on either side
it sit below a shatter
ceiling brick dismantle expose a
holmes look back at watson and irene
quiet

that shaft lead directly to
parliament
when activate those
electrode on either side will
send a charge convert the
cyanide powder into a gas

all of the people inside that
build

will be dead at the strike of
noon




as if by magic
there will be no
one left to stop blackwood and he
follower from assuming control

then
he brace he massive foot angle he huge leg and
push squeeze they against the wall like a human vice

throughandthrough
and continue to burn inside dredger

the incontinence of you
hypocrisy

wall to complete the pentagram within the circle

and i name to you be death




the electrical charge zaps through the device
electrode sizzle sending blind spark through the
cradle
holmes and irene the cylinder out of the way just

holmes whip around see watson seemingly dead
he
go to he drop to he knee next to watson feel for
a pulse
with he face still pressed to the stone

i be pretty sure i hear the last
chime
holmes look down at he friend relieve

yes we make it
just
watson roll over sit up
he be do have enough

come on you have get to admit
you be going to miss this

which part
the stench of the
sewer or the break bone
i ankle do
watson look around

where be irene
holmes turn look
the cylinder be go and so be
irene
he face darken
he misread she yet again

holmes i be sorry
holmes see irenes lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
of tunnel
he motion to the disable device

make sure Lestrade keep it
intact
watson nod
he watch holmes sprint into the darkness
face grim



blackwood flash downward through the ornate official
understory of the house head for a staircase
spiral even **further/far down



irene hear holmes angry footstep behind she turn
see a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnel
and column
she pick up speed


blackwood enter the maze of tunnel hear then see
irene sprint across the maze about yard away
then holmes
blackwood follow they
see something on the ground
ahead pause
it be fling there from the previous
action with dredger
blackwood scoop it up



panting irene run along a tunnel that step low
and pinch tight
largediameter water pipe
angle down the tunnel wall forcing irene to turn
sideways to continue
the sound of holmes footstep drive she forward
and then the tunnel end
the water pipe break off
jaggedly in midair next to irenes head
the continuation of the pipe pass through solid brick
at the end of the tunnel a dark claustrophobic
gamble
irene hesitate for a moment then slither into
the pipe into the unknown


the pipe angle down damp horrible
for a long moment
it be pitch black pinched down
irenes quick anxious
breath the only point of reference
this be as tight subterranean dark and nightmarishly
claustrophobic as it get
then almost imperceptibly light
we can make out irenes determine profile
light
increase and so do irenes rate of movement



the pipe emerge from the brick wall in what look to be
the cellar of a build
stonework fairly new
dim daylight from an unseen open show a fix ladder
heading upwards
irene accelerate for it


holmes grimace enter the pipe shimmies we
an even tight fit for he


irene climb with one hand cylinder in the other
reach an iron grate have to use all she strength to
shoulder it aside
as fit and athletic as she be this
be a grind



irene emerge at the base of a dark hollow build full
of construction equipment and see yes
more stairs upward
the only ready way out
grit she tooth chest heaving irene charge the
stairs
i
i
just as holmes pop out of the pipe vault onto the
fix ladder and swarm up it
anger lend he energy




irene finally make it to a floor in the build that be
flooded with skybright daylight
she surge for light a brickframed window and





at the top of
she be climb up
the inside of the tower
she be foot above the
thames
we have go straight from maximum claustrophobia to
maximum kneebuckling exposure
and a massive
that start with irene at the
window
then show the skeletal bridge span tenuously with
scaffolding
then the glory of london the center of the world
laid out for we in breathtaking spectacular beauty
and return to irene as recovered somewhat she
dart onto the walkway scaffolding that cross above the
thames



irene work she way through the construction debris on
the bridge
she make it to the end no far to go

woman
sherlock appear behind she winded

it be bad manner to leave without
at least saying goodbye

irene turn

goodbye
he start to move towards she
she whip out she gun

you of all people know i will pull
this trigger
they circle around each other




i would tell you i be sorry that i
wish thing could be different but
you would not believe i anyway

why hurry off give it a try
he move in again
she shoot he in the arm
and in that split second
blackwood drop down from behind irene she with

she drop stun
as she fall
blackwood pluck the cylinder out of she hand and kick
she gun away
she gun go flying off the side of the
bridge
but irene do not pause
she swing she leg through the air trying to take out
blackwoods knee
but he swipe she leg away and
and


you be well off without she
holmes
high above
a land





look between they and then it be on
holmes grab a
short section of wooden batten out of the railing
flimsy no match for the sword
which be immediately apparent as blackwood come in
slash chop six inch off the batten

i planned to kill a handful of
senile old man to make this empire
strong
but now because of you
thousands be going to die
holmes be on the defensive throughout but as before
he target be the cylinder first blackwood second self
defense third

all i have to do be break this
cylinder
the wind will do the
rest
and you will be the first
the two man continue they swordfight
holmes grab some
rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swing off
the bridge
blackwood step to the edge with he sword
out awaiting holmes
holmes swing towards the blade
and then push off the bridge once again to avoid it
holmes swing back onto the bridge a few foot away from
blackwood
he land whip off he scarf and twirl it
around blackwoods arm binding they together
they
continue to spar now bound
blackwood snarl mount a frenzied attack which holmes
simply try to survive
the two man finally part with
holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge
blackwood smile
he grab holmes gun which blackwood
knock from irenes hand early
blackwood fire at holmes
holmes quickly duck
the
bullet miss he but hit a bucket twirling above his
head
black liquid begin to pour out in a
circle around he
holmes turn as if to flee not that there be anywhere to
go he eye lock on to something
he look back to
blackwood
holmes kick a huge scaffolding plank which fall
whipping a coil of rope across the floor hooking
blackwood around he ankle



blackwood be down the walkway by the weight of
the falling plank pulled toward the edge
holmes grab the cylinder as blackwood pass
blackwood dig he finger into a gap screech to a
painful halt
he finger be white from strain
holmes
remains cool

there be never any magic
only
conjure trick
above holmes
the raven start at a rope

the simple involve paying
people off like the prison
guard
holmes look over the edge of the walkway
he see the
plank swinging dangerously in the storm
blackwood
strain desperately to hold on
as holmes step closer
we with relevant

guard choking
payoff
who pretended to be possess
outside you cell
you
reputation and you jailer fear
do the rest
burial ground
licking rock
other required more elaborate
preparation like the sandstone
slab that covered you tomb
you
have it broken before you burial
then put back together use a
mild adhesive
an ancient
egyptian recipe i believe a
mixture of egg and honey
design to be washed away by the
rain or eat by animal
bathReordon
flashback
arrange for you father to drown
in he own bathtub required more
modern science
very clever of
Reordon to find a paralytic that
be activate by the combination
of copper and water and be
therefore undetectable once the
bath water be drained




that might have be quite
challenge have he not also tested
it on some unfortunate amphibian
standish in rain
pulling the trigger
wharf explosion
the death of standish be a real
mystery until you used the same
compound to blow up the wharf
an
odorless tasteless flammable
liquid yet it burned with an
unusual pinkish hue
do standish
mistake it for rain as he entered
you temple
all it take be a
spark
simple rigged bullet in
he gun
ingenious
Parliamentflask
ceremony dev ice
like all great performer you
saved you piece de resistance for
the end
have it work you
follower in parliament would have
watch unharmed as they
colleague be dying around they
they do not know that you have
given they the antidote at one
of you ceremony i suspect
instead they would have believe
it be magic and that you
harnessed the ultimate power




blackwood struggle to hold on he lose he grip for a
second and be drag back toward the precipice
wind
whip hard
holmes do not notice
the ravens rope starting
a slow subtle

a bucket drop
hit a row of standing timber
the timber start to
topple

each time one object strike another we hear a
faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
that holmes play early for he fly


you hated you father and the
other member of the temple of the
four order for what they do to
you
how satisfy it must have
be to use they own system
against they


we see the slow inexorable domino continue
to fall
the last timber fall over the edge land on a
rope
the rope yank down a crane the crane swing
strike another crane

cut i loose holmes
blackwoods eye be full of fear
holmes thoughtfully
look out at the angry storm the atmosphere electric and
dangerous
holmes give the slight hint of a smile

you well hope that it be nothing
more than superstition as you
perform all the ritual
perfectly
holmes look around at the gather storm
blackwood can hold on no long
he scream as he
release he grip and be torn down the walkway at
breakneck speed
quick as a snake holmes grab a workman ax place on
the side and hurl it at he foot cutting the rope
blackwoods imminent death be bring suddenly to a halt
the storm grow in ferocity
holmes bend down
blackwood be on he knee cowed




first the world will see you for
what you be
then you will
hang
properly this time
blackwood look up

the crane dislodge a
which miss holmes by inch as it crash
through the floorboard
blackwood smirk

we will see about that shall we
it be a long journey from here to
the rope

holmes look up
blackwood look up

we will see about that shall we

the top of the crane crash down
the wooden
infrastructure support blackwood fall away
sending blackwood falling into a lattice of
below
blackwood scream as the chain begin to
snap off one by one
he fall farther
and farther
and finally

the last chain around
blackwoods neck killing he instantly
blackwood dangle on the rusty chain hang like a
common man after all with tower bridge as he gibbet
holmes just stand there stun
he look out to see
the fly away a silhouette against the stormy
sky
the bird flap it wing disappearing into a
cloud
he brow furrow
perhaps there really be some thing
that cannot be explain
holmes look over the side of the bridge see
be awkwardly splayed on the low level
she
appear to be dead possibly a small trickle of blood be
coming out of she mouth
holmes move down to she
he
take she hand

oh irene
he finger move to take she pulse



she eye pop open
irene make a quick move
she try to he
but
this time holmes be ready for it
he reverse the move cuff she instead
he take a
seat next to she
they sit there for a beat an odd lover moment looking
out over the thames

it look like rain

we have still get a moment
bit of a smile and break

you be right he be a professor
moriarty
key in the watch
pocket



holmes reach over to grab the key
they face close
near a kiss
holmes drop the key down the top of she
shirt
he
snatch the from around she neck turn and
walk away
she smile call out

you will miss i sherlock

sadly yes
holmes walk away pause to pick up watsons sword
stick keep walking
at the end of the top of the stairs
holmes hand the
cylinder to one of the policeman



rain fall softly

it will be a hell of a trick if
blackwood come back from this
one

thank you Lestrade

now you be going to be even more
arrogant and insufferable than
ever
then Lestrade crack a smile

you be welcome detective
be the woman up there

she will not be by the time you boy
get there
holmes keep moving into the night
the storm curl
around he the rain falling hard
and he see



shadow be waiting for he
we recognize the figure of

holmes can not help but smile
he join watson
no word spoken
holmes hold out watsons sword stick
watson take it
the two of they stand looking out down the thames





mary and watson walk towards

scribble

watson laugh then pause for a moment to consider this
idea before they enter




as watson and mary climb the stairs it become clear
that mary now wear on she finger
holmes have it make into an engagement ring

i still can not believe he be given
we that ring

do you think he be finally come to

watson open the door of holmes apartment revealing a
horrific scene
holmes be hanging from a rope he back
to they
he look dead




do not panic dear
watson and mary step in but do nothing to help holmes

suicide be not in he repetoire
he be far too fond of himself
watson poke he
turn he around

deduce the manner in which
blackwood survive he execution

soporific effect and i be carry

a caterpillar in a cocoon

hangman knot be a hook i

watson draw he sword

but none of this explain the lack
of a pulse
he finally use he sword stick and slice holmes down
holmes tumble to the ground

there be a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron
ponticum
it be quite infamous in
the region of turkey bordering the
black sea for it ability to
induce an apparently mortal
paralysis
enough to mislead a
medical mind even as tenacious and
welltrained as you own
it be
known locally as

what be wrong with gladstone

mad honey disease

stiff as a board

he be demonstrate the very
effect i have just described
he
do not mind

he heart should be ticking in no
time

he head
they be interrupt by a knock on the door
