Nelle
kudo on kill the bird
be
that it

close enough
thanks

he have not written a word yet though
he say it be the nonfiction book of
the decade



he be little but terrifying

he be as short as i be
and almost as
pretty
i would be with he right now
but he be be given new
accommodation

most people assume he be a monster
i
do not see he that way
the book i be
write will return he to the realm
of humanity it be the book i be
always mean to write

watch out
this be the start of a
great love affair

oh yes
truman in love with truman

i be in marilyns apartment just
last week
i have to break it to she
that of the four matiss hanging
on she wall two be upside down

another
to answer you question i be follow
breakfast at Tiffanys by blaze
a different path by invent an
entirely new kind of write
the
nonfiction novel

you have a subject

on the night of november two man
broke into a quite farmhouse in kansas
and murdered an entire family
why
do they do that
it be be suggested
that this subject be tawdry it be
not worthy of literature
i disagree
two world exist in this country
the quiet conservative life and the
life of those two man the
underbelly the criminally violent
those world converge that bloody
night
i spent the past three month
interviewing everyone in kansas
touched by that violence
i spent
hour talking to the killer and
i will spend more
waiter bring his
drink
research this work have changed i
life altered i point of view about
almost everything
i think those who
read it will be similarly affected
such a book can only be written by a
journalist who have master the
technique of fiction

you be speaking of yourself

you be really very clever



perrys decided to appeal
he claim
they attorney be incompetent
that he never raised the issue of
temporary insanity

so you find they a new lawyer

they be facing execution in six week
jack
they need someone to argue
whether or not that be right

okay

i would also like to see they alive
yes thank you very much
i need to
hear they story

if you meet he you would understand
it be as if noone ever ask he a
single question about himself
he be
so
damage and strange
unexplored
i do not trust this Hickock fellow
perrys the only person who can
describe to i what happen that
night
i need to hear he say it

just be careful what you do to get
what you want

i be finding they a lawyer

truman
you be finding yourself a
lawyer


warden Krutch will see you now

we do well by we boy
shower once
a week
feed em good

he do not eat
get the food in through
he arm

what be you talking about

have not eat in a month
but it be
not he right to kill himself
it be
the people right
the people of
this state
and that be who i work
for the people
you can write any
of this down

no one told i

yah

that be no good
i need to see
they now then whenever i want for
as long as i want

not how we do thing here

i see

i understand what a burden unlimited
visitation might be on this
institution and on the people who
pay for it
i want to be clear that
i do not expect the citizen of
leavenworth county to have to shoulder
that burden

to be dispense as you see fit

i do not know where to count you
boy be halfIndian
i do he
a favor though
count he white

you be a kind and generous man


i hero

high wheat plain of western kansas
a lonesome area that other Kansans
call out there
until one morning
in midNovember few american
in fact few Kansans have ever
hear of Holcomb
like the water of
the river like the
motorist on the highway
exceptional happening have never
stopped there

the four coffin which quite filled
the small flowercrowded parlor
be to be sealed at the funeral
service very understandably for
the effect
be disquieting
nancy
wear she dress of cherryred velvet
she brother a bright plaid shirt
the parent be more sedately
attire mr
clutter in navyblue
flannel he wife in navyblue crepe
and and it be this especially
that lend the scene an awful aura
the head of each be completely
encase in cotton a swell cocoon
twice the size of an ordinary blown
up balloon and the cotton because
it have be sprayed with a glossy
substance twinkle like christmas
tree snow


imagination of course can open any
door turn the key and let terror
walk right in
tuesday at
dawn a carload of
stranger
ignorant of the local disaster
be startle by what they see as
they crossed the prairy and passed
through Holcomb
window ablaze
almost every window in almost every
house and in the brightly light room
fully clothed people even entire
family who have sit the whole night
wide awake watchful listen
of
what be they frighten
it might
happen again
