no real room left
all we have get be
attic space
no one ever want the
attic space

this will do nicely

in science the letter of fact be
the letter of law
we pursuit be as
dogmatic as any religious precept
think of yourselves as disciple of
a strict and hallowed sect
someday
you may be priest
but only if
you learn the scripture chapter and
verse
any question

but surely professor you do not
intend we disregard the more
philosophical works

philosophical

those which stir the imagination as
well as the intellect
paracelsus
for one

paracelsus

or albertus magnus
cornelius
agrippa

what be you name

victor frankenstein sir
of geneva

of geneva
tell i mr
frankenstein of geneva
do you wish to study medicine
or
mysticism

those of you unfamiliar with mr
frankensteins suggested reading
list
thankfully that would be
most of you
would be well advise
to avoid it
here at ingolstadt we
concern ourselves with immutable
reality
not the raving of lunatic and
alchemist hundreds of year in they
grave
understand

i be relieve
be there any relevant
question
lecture hall dismiss

i be just clearing i throat

very well then

you know you be quite mad

i be not mad

match victor
tone
as a march hare

be you have i on

of course i be
it pay to humor the
insane

henry clerval

victor victor frankenstein

i know
you have a way of making an
impression

do you really think i be mad

come now
magnus
agrippa
next thing
you know you will be teaching
toadstool to speak

if it be not the sorcerer
find
yourself an apprentice

i be afraid i rejected he application
he merely dabble

Dilettantes need not apply
what
about you
schiller be not it

von schiller
i be interest in real
medicine
treat the sick

really
i myself find sick people
rather revolting
i be here to secure i degree with a
minimum of fuss and hard work that i
might settle into a life of privilege
treat rich old lady with gout
and dally with they daughter

you two disgust i

rich old lady and they daughter

can you think of a good reason

quite a few

do i a favor then
keep they to yourself

it be turning out to be a good year

let we return a tenth of the crop to
the tenant
they have a hard winter

not even you father would be that
generous

then there be no need to tell he be
there

miss
the mail arrive
there be one
from master victor

and not a day go by that i do
not cherish you face in i mind
eye or ache to see you all again
be
assure that i be with you in spirit
and you be never far from i
thought
i remain as always you
love and devote victor



what do it say

it say give willie an extra big
hug for i

read it again




that be no excuse for be a pompous
ass

i will see you throw out of this
university
i will go to the dean
himself
take i at i word
frankenstein
the dean himself

the entire school hear it
it be not
something one could miss

you be a comfort to i henry

what now
write about it in you
journal will not help

it be a letter to i father

professor waldman

victor explain yourself

krempe have a way of provoking i
temper

you have a way of provoking he
i have be watch you
you seem
impatient with you study

to say the least
i come here to
expand i mind but honest inquiry
seem strangle at every turn
all
we do be cling to the old knowledge
instead of seeking the new

you disdain accept wisdom

no i embrace it
as something to
be used or discarded as we advance
the boundary of what be known

now you have get he start

these be exciting times henry
we be enter an era of amazing
breakthrough
look at edward jenner
he be not content to bleed people
with leech he pioneer a new
frontier of thought

yes and thank to he smallpox
have be virtually eliminate
i have
hear this speech before

but you have not listen never in
history have so much seem possible
we be on the verge of answer undreamt
of
but only if we have the courage
to ask the question

i understand you frustration
i be
young once myself
walk i home
something i would like to
show you

you know for thousands of year the
chinese have base they medical
science on the belief that the human
body be a chemical engine run by
electricity
they say we all contain
stream of energy which flow through
we like current in the ocean or
river in the earth

they doctor treat patient by
insert needle like these into
the flesh at various key point to
manipulate these electric stream

preposterous

i once see it do as a boy in
canton
i parent be missionary
the cure be nothing short of
miraculous
i have never forgotten it
be
fascinated ever since

it smack of magic

magic
seem alive do not it

electricity

it be utterly fantastic
this be the
sort of thing i be talking about
we
should be learning this

why
god alone know what it mean
until it have proven value it be
nothing more than a ghoulish parlor
trick
hardly fit for the classroom

but the possibility
combine
ancient knowledge with new
something
like this could change we fundamental
view

it be a thril direction to
explore
thrilling and dangerous
nature can be wonderful and terrible
science be not a realm for the
reckless
it need a conscience
we
must proceed cautiously
assess as
we go
what i do on i own time be i own
business
the same hold true for
you
you wish to expand you mind
fine do so
you can even join i
here if you like
but not at the
expense of you normal study

i doubt that decision be still mine
to make

nonsense
tonight you will draft an
apology to professor krempe


a sincere and heartfelt apology
which you will then read aloud to
he before the assemble student
body and faculty

why

we profession need talent like
yours
destroy you career over an
issue of pride
what a waste

go home victor
write the letter

and i **further/far wish to extend i
sincere regret to professor krempe
for i display
i behavior toward
he be both rash and inexcusable



i know hold get himself in trouble

must have be a terrible row

he be almost expel for calling
one of he professor a pompous
fellow


he always be opinionate

he set thing right with a proper
apology
and now they have put he
in charge of dissection lab

what be that

that be where they cut thing open
and peer about inside

thing
what sort of thing

it be far too ghoulish for you young
ear

the point be you brother be a
brilliant student well on he way to
becoming the finestand most
compassionate doctor ever

reconfigure the lead

number four and twelve directly
into the nervous system

worth a try

and the medulla oblongata be the
transition between the spinal cord
and the two part i have already
named
cerebrum and cerebellum
any freshman feeling queasy yet
all of you from the look of it
we will resume you torture tomorrow

you seem to be adapt well to the
approve curriculum

despite the lack of challenge

victor
he be trying to be gracious

the strain be evident

come now you must take some
satisfaction
you have rise to the
top of you class
position of
prominence and regard

what keep i going be i friend

leave off

you elizabeth must be quite a
treasure victor
to justify these price

should not the nose be above the mouth

i be quite serious
look at all the
charity and clinic work we do
up
until thirty year ago the concept
of vaccine be unheard of

you be saying all disease will
eventually be eradicate

i be convince
not by treat
symptom but by dive nature
most jealouslyguarded secret

do you foresee this happening in we
lifetime

no
but someday

thank goodness
we would be out of work

only you would think of that

somebody have to

i tell you what we need i friend
forget the symptom and disease
what we need be a vaccine for death
itself

oh now you have go too far
there be
only one god victor

and here to he
everything in
moderation frankenstein

nothing in moderation clerval

yer not stickin it in i
get pox
in it i hear tell

pox
they givin we pox

no it be not pox it be a vaccine

Vacawhat

vaccine from the latin vacca
meaning cow
or vaccinia meaning cowpox

i told you there be pox in it

no no cowpox in a minute
quantity perfectly harmless give
you a natural immunity to small ox
which be the point of this whole
bloody exercise

you doctor kill people
i do care
what you say you be not stickin it
in i

i most assuredly be
it prevent
disease and it be the law
why be i
explaining myself
somebody restrain
this damn fool

professor

oh god

they just caught the man who do it

he be a frighten soul who act
out of fear and ignorance

they will hang he all the same

good
i will be there to hear his
worthless neck snap

keep you voice down
you do not know
what you be saying

it be wrong henry
it should not
have happen
the bastard deserve
to die

you be making a scene

why waldman
he of all people should
have cheated death

you can not
death be god will

i resent god monopoly

that be blasphemy

blasphemy be damn
waldman spent
he life trying to help people

all the more reason for we to continue
he work with the poor

no
he have more important work

there be sick people who need we
help
here and now
not in some future
time
consider that

life and death
why should you alone have the final
say


to understand the cause of life we
must first have recourse to death
and examine the process in minute
detail

he body to be left on public
display for a twentyfour hour period
thereafter to be consign to an
unmarked pauper grave
so the court
have spoken

no longer pathetic and useless

victor
this have get to stop
Nobodys see you in month
you
have not attend a single class

i have be preoccupy

we all know how hard you take
Waldmans death
even krempe be
sympathetic
but it be time to move
on
it be time to concern yourself
with life

that be i concern
i be involve in something just now
i want to finish it in Waldmans
memory

how much long

few month perhaps
i be gathering
the raw material even now

mr

strange
perhaps you would well come

victor

victor
it be you
thank god

be it true
what they say about
willie
be it true

yes

willie
i poor little angel
victor
they think i do it

do you

i do not believe
i be in need of
you comfort
anymore

do you justine

get out

i find she sob she eye out
poor thing i said what be all this
and she spilled she heart to i about
master victor
how she would always loved
he and now he be coming home to
marry mistress elizabeth

she cry and cry about the
beautiful locket he would send
how she
wished it be hers
she swear i
never to tell a soul
that be before the boy go miss
course

i always view she with brotherly
affection
i have no idea of she
feeling for i

rejection can be a powerful wound
people have be known to do uncanny
thing

but to commit so ghastly and terrible
a crime against a child she loved

it be hard to believe

justine and i grow up as sister
i
know she good than anybody

do you think it possible she committed
this crime

william be as much she child as
mine
we be both mother to he
i believe she would sooner have
strangled the life from she own body

then you consider the charge without
merit

i consider the charge imbecilic

yes
i take refuge in the barn
would not you
lose in the storm
freezing and wet
i be exhausted
and could search no long

and be it true miss moritz that
you love victor frankenstein
that
you heart be broken
answer the question
do you love
victor frankenstein

i have always loved he

be it also not true that you murdered
he brother william in a misdirect
crime of passion

murder willie
in i heart he be
we child
victor and mine
such a
thing could never have enter i
mind

so you have claim
yet you have no
explanation for this
the locket last see in the hand of
the poor murder child be find
hidden in you dress the morning
following the murder
the locket you
so covete
how do it come to be in you
possession

i have no knowledge of that

frankenstein

oh god
oh god
no


oh god
justine
forgive i

i mind be not playing trick
he
be there in the storm
gloat
over he crime
challenging i to
come

but why risk yourself
have not this
family suffer enough

i have no choice

if what you say be true it be a
matter for the police

they have do a fine job
hanging an
innocent for the crime of a fiend

do you know this man
be there
something between you

i know only that he be a killer
and i shall bring back he carcass



come warm yourself if you like

you speak

yes i speak
and read
and think
and know the way of man
i have be waiting for you
two month
now

how do you find i

the letter in you journal
that
and a geography book
you elizabeth sound lovely

kill i and have do with it

kill you
hardly that

then why be i here
what do you
want with i

more to the point why be i here
what do you want with i
what do one say to one maker
have finally meet he face to face
milton give it voice
grab a book thumb
to a certain page
do i request thou maker from i
clay to mould i man
do i solicit
thou from darkness to promote i

fine word from a child killer
you
who murdered i brother

you crime
as well as mine

how dare you
you be disgusting and
evil

evil
do you believe in evil

i see it before i

i be not sure i believe
but then i
have no one to instruct i
i have no
mother
and i father abandoned i
at birth

be the die cry of you brother
music in i ear

i take he by the throat with one
hand
lift he off the ground
and slowly crush he neck
that poor innocent child die in i
grip
because all i could see be
you face
and all i could feel
be i rage
and when i let he go
he flutter to the grass like a
sparrow

later when they be searching i
follow the pretty lady who get
lost in the wood



she be so lovely
i long to touch
she
and seek she sympathy



but i simply return the object
which have trigger i crime hope
in some small way to atone

you give i these emotion but you
do not tell i how to use they
now
two people be dead
because of we

why victor
why
what be you
think

there be something at work in i
soul which i do not understand

what of i soul
do i have one
or
be that a part you left out
who be these people of which i be
comprise
good people
bad people

material
nothing more

you be wrong
do you know i know how
to play this

in which part of i do this knowledge
reside
in these hand
in this mind
in this heart
and reading and speaking
not thing
learned
so much as thing
remember

trace memory in the brain perhaps

steal memory
steal and hazy
they taunt i in i dream
i have
see a beautiful woman lying back
and beckoning for i to love she
whose woman be this
i have see boy
playing splash about in a stream
whose childhood friend be these
who be i

i do not know

then perhaps i believe in evil after
all

what can i do

there be something i want
friend

friend

companion
female
like i so
she will not hate i

like you
oh god you do not know
what you be asking

i do know that for the sympathy of
one live be i would make peace
with all
i have love in i the like of which
you can scarcely imagine
and rage
the like of which you would not
believe
if i cannot satisfy the
one i will demonically indulge the
other
that choice be yours
you be the one who set this in motion
frankenstein

and if i consent

we would travel north i bride and i
to the far reach of the pole
where no man have ever set foot
there
we would live out we live
together
no human eye would ever see we again
this i vow

soon

and watch

for

what do you find

these have be fired

at shadow

of i
