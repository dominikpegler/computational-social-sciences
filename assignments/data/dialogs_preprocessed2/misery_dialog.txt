it be not nearly as bad as it look
you have a compound fracture of the
tibia in both leg and the fibula
in the leave leg be fracture too

recover to do and i consider it
an honor that you will do it in i
home

four or five day ago
why


no reason


i guess it be kind of a miracle
you finding i

no it be not a miracle at all
in
a way i be following you

following i

well it be not any secret to i
that you be staying at the silver
creek seeing as how i be you number
one fan and all
some night i would
just tool on down there sit outside
and look up at the light in you
cabin
gently move his
head back expose
he neck
this next
be say with total
sincerity almost
awe
and i would try to imagine what be going
on in the room of the world great
writer

say that last part again i do not
quite hear

do not move nowwould not want to
hurt this neck
well the other afternoon i be on
i way home and there you be
leaving the lodge and i wonder
why a literary genius would go for a
drive when there be a big storm
coming

i do not know it be going to be a
big storm

lucky for you i do
lucky for i too
because now you be
alive and you can write more book
oh paul i have read everything of
yours but the misery novel


i know they all by heart paul all
eight of they
i love they so


you be very kind

and you be very brilliant and you
must be a good man or you could
never have created such a wondrous
love creature as misery Chastain
run she finger
over he cheek
like a baby
all do
start to dab away
the last bit of
soap

when do you think the phone line
be back up
i have to call i
daughter and i should call new york
and let i agent know i be breathing

it should not be too much longer
once the road be open the line
be up in no time
if you give i
they number i will keep trying they
for you
suddenly almost
embarrass
could i ask you a favor
i notice in you case there be a
new paul sheldon book and
and i wonder if maybe

you want to read it

if you would not mind

i have a hard and fast rule about
who can read i stuff at this early
stageonly i editor i agent and
anyone who save i from freezing to
death in a car wreck

you will never realize what a rare
treat you have given i



boy it be like clockwork the way
you pain comesI will get you you
Novril paul
forgive i for prattle
away and making you feel all oogy


what be you new book called

i do not have a title yet

what be it about

it be crazy but i do not really know
i mean i have not written anything
but misery for so long thatyou
read it you can tell i what you
think it be about
maybe you can come
up with a title

oh like i could do that


nothing unusual about mr
sheldons
leaving Busteryou can tell by the
champagne

maybe you can libby

no see he always ordered a bottle
of dom perignon when he be ready to
go
then he would pay up and be out the
door

no longdistance phone call federal
express packagesanything at all
out of the ordinary

i do not think mr
sheldon like for
thing to be out of the ordinary
consider who he be and all famous
and all he do not have air
drive
the same car out from new york each
time Mustangsaid it help he
think
he be always a good guest
never make a noise never bothered a
soul
sure hope nothing happen to
he

so do i

i will bet that old mustang pulling
into new york right now

i be sure you be right



almost shy about
this
i know i be only forty page into
you book but

but what

nothing

no what be it

oh it be ridiculous who be i to
make a criticism to someone like
you

i can take it go ahead

well it be brilliantly written but
then everything you write be
brilliant

pretty rough so far

the swearing paul
there i said it

the profanity bother you

it have no nobility

well these be slum kid i be a
slum kid everybody talk like that


they do not
what do you think i say
when i go to the feed store in town
now wally give i a bag of that
eff pigfeed and ten pound of
that bitchly cowcorn


and in the bank do i tell mrs
bollinger here one big bastard
of a check give i some of you
Christing money



seeing the spill
suddenly upset
there
look there

the presumption must now be that
paul sheldon be dead
we know he
somehow crawl out of he car
but
we have be unable to locate his
body in the vicinity of the crash
we also know if anyone have find
he they would have taken he to an
area hospital
he body be undoubtedly
out there buried somewhere in the
snow
we will find he after the first
thawunless the animal have get
to he first
i will take question




you do not think he be dead do you

he might well be
but not the way
they say
he do not crawl out of
that car by himself
you see those
dent on the doorsomeone pulled
he out

it be an old carthose dent could
have be there forever

there be two kind of people that
drive around in old car
the one
that can not afford new one and the
one who would not give they up for
anything in the world
that second
bunch do not drive around with twenty
fiveyearold dent




do not be nervous
just remember i will treasure
whatever you do



Miserys Retur

you can leave that in

i really value you criticism but
maybe you be be a little hasty
here

paul what you have written just be not
fair

that be rightwhen i be growing up
in Bakersfield i favorite thing in
all the world be to go to the movie
on saturday afternoon for the chapter

and once it be a nobrakes chapter
the bad guy stick he in a car on a
mountain road and knock he out
and weld the door shut and tear
out the brake and start he to
he death and he wake up and tried
to steer and tried to get out but
the car go off a cliff before he
could escape and it crashed and burned
andI be so upset and excite and
the next week you well believe i
be first in line and they always
start with the end of the last week
and there be rocket man trying to
get out and here come the cliff and
the car go off he jump

remember ian do ride for dr
cleary
at the end of the last book but he
horse fell jumping that fence and
ian broke he shoulder and he rib
and lay there all night in the ditch
so he never reach the doctor so
there could not have be any
experimental blood transfusion
that saved she life
misery be buried
in the ground at the end paul so
you will have to start there

you well
oh paul when ian
realized that the reason they would buried
misery alive be because the bee
sting have put she in that temporary
coma


and when gravedigger wilkes
remember how thirty year early
the same thing have happen to lady
EvelynHyde
and then old dr
cleary deduce
that misery must be lady EvelynHydes
longlost daughter because of the
rarity of deadly beestingsmy heart
just leap


i have known from the very first book
that misery have to be born of nobility
and i be right

yeah yeah

when you finish
i can fill in the
ns
