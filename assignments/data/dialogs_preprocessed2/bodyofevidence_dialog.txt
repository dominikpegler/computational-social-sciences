we can now see it be the same room on the
tape
the bed lie the naked body of a sheet
covering he low torso
he face be ashen mouth open his
dull eye looking out in a fix stare
the last instant of
he life be etch upon a face frozen in pain


fill the night sky
overhead
the
wind whip the furiously against anything in it path
the move slowly along row of beautiful
at the
end be a culdesac
several be in the driveway
they
fourdoor pull into the driveway
step
out into the rain
he be a handsome latin in he thirties
with hard chiseled feature and black slickedbacked hair
he do not run through the rain he walk
a man who look more like an accountant than a
homicide detective run out to meet he


be it marsh

yeah
just a hint of sadness show on cardenas face
it last an
instant then it be go

sir do you mind if we get out of the
rain
cardenas do not move
he ignore the question

who find he

he secretary
joanne Braslow

she be here

no
she stopped by to pick up some
paper

show i
reese start for the house
cardenas look up into the night
sky
of fill the


pull back to reveal a snap picture of
marsh in bed
cardenas enter follow by reese
he move through the
and
anything cardenas feel about the
gruesome sight before he be hidden behind a mask of
indifference
standing by the bed be
a short babyfaced man
cardenas look down at the
body then over at the
McCURDY a
portly man with windblown cheek and bloodshot eye

how long


about three hour

because

not sure
i will have everything you
need tomorrow

take a look at this
reese point to the nightstand drawer and Troxell open it
on
top of the nightstand be a box of tissue and a bottle of nasal
spray
inside be and an assortment of


this guy be into some kinky shit
cardenas look at the various sexual device then walk out of
the room


sit on chair
she eye be tired red from
crying
she be mid thirties attractive but she look come
more from effort than nature expensive hair cut the right
cosmetic
she have a corporate look to she
cardenas step into the hall and walk over to she

miss Braslow i be district attorney
john cardenas
you arrive at what
time tonight

little after eleven

why do you come by

i have some paper to pick up

do you know who mr
marsh be with

i assume he girlfriend


she name

rebecca lawson

you would not know she address would
you

no but i can get it for you

thank you

marsh be not alone
we find trace
of sperm on the sheet
the
toxicology report say there be
high level of cocaine in he blood

Whatd he die of

the official because of death be a
cardiac arrest

the official because

that be what i report will read

but there be more

it be speculative at this point
marsh have advanced arterial disease
he heart attack be induced by
excessive aerobic activity in
conjunction with the drug


what be you saying henry
that he
girlfriend fuck he to death

yes

what can we prove

we know marsh have a head cold
we
find cocaine mixed with water in a
nasal spray container on the
nightstand
the coke would contract
the nasal membrane the same as any
decongestant but for a much short
time
he would keep use more and more
never knowing what he be taking

any print on the nasal spray

Marshs and rebecca Lawsons

what if he do know what be in it
lot of user put it in nasal spray
bottle so they can use it in public

cocaine be the last thing a man in
he condition would want

can we put rebecca lawson at the
scene


man across the street from marsh
see she drive up about four thirty
sunday afternoon
and she print be
all over the place

Marshs cardiologist told i that
after marsh be diagnose with heart
disease he quit smoking quit
drink and start exercise every
day
do that sound like a guy
who start shoveling cocaine up his
nose

what do he say about miss lawson

he can remember at least one occasion
and the receptionist can recall
two time when she accompany marsh
to the office

so she know about he heart

have to
i also interview three
woman who be in past relationship
with marsh
there be no evidence that
he have anything but straight sex
prior to meet miss lawson

what about the will

that be the good part
she get it
all everything


miss lawson

i be district attorney john cardenas

i do not think that this be the time
or the place

i just wanted to introduce myself and
inform miss lawson that there will be
an inquiry

an inquiry into what

for starter i would like to know why she
left the house and do not report the
death

because he be not dead when she left
and even if he be not reporting a
natural death in a timely fashion
be not a crime

do i say it be a natural death

you know i know andrew marsh for
almost twenty year or think i

about she that make he want to do
it


miss lawson i be frank Dulaney

be you going to represent i

there be no charge against you
i be
here to decide if i be going to
represent you should that occur
do you kill he

you do not waste any time do you

do you think i do it

i do not know
that be why i be asking
you

you must have some feel
some
immediate impression
young
attractive woman involved with an
old man who leaf she everything
in he will
and the thing that
go on in that house
such wild
sex
what kind of picture do that
paint

not a very good one i be afraid


and that be exactly what the jury will
see when they look at i
that be why
i need a very good lawyer mr
Dulaney

you be assuming the district attorney
be going to file charge

he will file
he be an ambitious man
ambitious man build they career on
the body of other

you still have not answer i
question

i loved he
big part of i life
have be torn away from i mr
Dulaney
part i can never get back
and on top of that people be
saying that i be somehow responsible
for it
they have taken everything
that be good and caring about two
people in love and make it dirty

no i do not kill he

i think i be going to make you day

how


i have get this guy in i office
doctor alan paley
wait until you
hear what he have to say

how can cardenas possibly think he
can build a case against two
consent adult

he must have something or he would not
be pressing so hard

if he file be you going to take the
case

i do not know yet
i want to hear
what she say at she statement
tomorrow

what be she like

attractive
bright
distant
charming when she want to be

she sound like quite a woman

yeah but can she cook


the whole thing give i the creep
i mean what if she really hump
he to death

hump

yes

i can think of bad way to go

and speaking of humping

i do not know that andrew be dead
until mr
Sattler called i at home
that night

we have a witness who see you go into
the house at four thirty

she be not deny she be there

do you have sex


yes

what time do you leave

six thirty and he be very much
alive

miss lawson do you use cocaine

i have

do you use it the night marsh die

no
i have not do it in year

do marsh use it

no never

it have to get there somehow

it do not get there from i

be you aware of mr
Marshs heart
condition

no

mr
Marshs cardiologist and he
nurse have tell we that you
accompany mr
marsh to they office
on at least two occasion

that be correct but andrew never
told i he have a heart condition
he
said he have a heart arrhythmia and it
be nothing serious

he never mention he heart disease


she just said that

why do you think he lie to you

that be something only marsh would
know

i think miss lawson know it too
i
think she slipped he the coke and he
pop he cork giving she the high
hardone

that be it
i client do not have to
take this crap from you

sit down frank

no
miss lawson come in here
voluntarily to answer you question
she do not have to sit here and be
insulted
so either you charge she
now or we be leaving

fine

rebecca lawson you be under arrest
for the murder of andrew marsh

you have the right to remain silent
if you give up


i do not think the handcuff will be
necessary
you can finish giving
miss lawson she right outside

frank

i will have you out in a few hour

Lookin to make the paper john

marsh left she close to three million
dollar in he will
that be motive
she admit to be there the night
of he death
that be opportunity
and she fingerprint be on the nasal
spray bottle

you can not show intent

can you

take you pole out of the water
frank
the fish be not biting today

you be bluffing
john it be i
remember
i have known you since you
name be juan carlos


mon think about it
if she be
going to kill marsh why leave the
nasal spray bottle there for the
police to find

she planned this
she wanted we to
find the nasal spray

why would she want that

because she be clever
because she
know that even if we do not find it
we would have suspicion as to why a man
in Marshs condition would use
cocaine

suspicion maybe but suspicion
be not enough for a conviction

the

s report stated that Marshs
nasal membrane show no sign of
prior cocaine use
without the nasal
spray we would have still treated it
as a poison
we would have look
for motive and the trail would have
still lead back to she

i do not buy it and neither will a
jury

we be going all the way on this one
frank
tell you client she have
until the prelim to cop a plea for
murder two fifteen to twenty five

i will tell she but she will not take it

then she be not as smart as i think
she be
you have see she in the
deposition
tell i you do not have
any doubt


she be innocent

be not they all

yeah
well we will let the
blindfold lady with the scale
decide that

i want you to know right now that the
trial going to be nasty
you sex
life be going to be drag through
the mud
they be going to say that
you entice marsh lead he down a
dark path

andrew hardly needed lead
he be
a very passionate man
he be eager
to explore
i give he what he
wanted
we fulfilled each other
need

this be a very small town people
here have very straight view on sex


i be used to be on the outside
looking in
the same man who will
publicly profess they moral outrage
for i sexual taste be the same
one who privately rest they sweaty
little hand on i leg and talk
about weekend trip together

those same man will be sitting on the
jury

i be who i be
i can not deny it
anymore than you can deny who you
be
i like sex different i like
it wild
that be not a crime
i loved andrew
we make love
together
we make it differently
but we still make love
it be we
way
it be private and now the
whole world want to look in through
the pretense of justice
if i be
some middleage divorcee who screw
he once a week do you think this
would be happening to i

have you ever see animal make love
mr
Dulaney
they have such passion
such savage emotion
they
struggle and snarl and claw but
neither hurt the other
not really

no pain no gain

something like that

we be not animal


of course we be
we primal urge
be still there but we have taken
sex and intellectualize it refine
it down to it most essential
component
it be bland easy
mechanical
there be great passion in
the struggle such crave in
denial
do you know what it be like
to yearn for something
i be not
talking about wanting or need
i be talking about an urge so deep
that you skin burn and every cell
in you body pulse with desire

i think we be get a little off
the subject here

i think the subject be sex

as it pertain to you not i
do you always know you have
different
taste

yes

how

i do not know if it be something i can
explain to you

why not

because it be beyond intellect
it be emotion
it be passion
it have
to be experience it can not be
imagined

try


when i be growing up we have a
strawberry patch in we backyard
so
do this family down the road
i
used to sneak in they yard and steal
they strawberry
it be not easy
the stone wall be high and i would
scrape i knee as i climb over
on the other side be wild rose
bush
the thorn would dig into i
leg and cut i thigh as i lowered
myself down

if you have what you wanted at home
why do you sneak into they yard

because somehow the fruit always
taste that much sweet because of
the pain it take to get to it

alberts get the stomach flu

that be too bad

no it be not
now i get to pitch

michael you should not be happy when
someone else be not feeling well

not even if they be a dork

not even if they be a dork
you
should go by and see how he be
feel


no way
jerry milner stopped by and
albert puke right in front of he

do not use language like that at the
dinner table

sorry

frank i know you be busy but
michael ask i after dinner if you
be angry with he
he wanted to
know why you be not talking to he

i will talk to he later

why do not you talk to he now

because i go to trial in seven week
i have get a lot of preparing to do

no one asking you not to work
i
just think you could make some time
for you son

i be sorry if it look like i be not
paying attention to you lately


you know how it be sometimes when
you be out playing ball with you
friend
how you be really
concentrate on what you be do
and you lose track of time and you
come home late and mom yell at you

yeah

well that be kind of how i be right
now

be mom yell at you too

yeah a little

i love you

i love you too dad

how you do mister

fine charlie
you familiar with the
marsh case


yeah i hear they have they a real
dog and pony show going on up there
i will tell you sometimes white
people be a real puzzle to i
i
mean do this old guy really think
he be going to be able to keep up with
a sweet little number like that

it could have happen to anyone

i be sorry man but i be not ever
hear of no brother dying from
gettin too much pussy

we have to find out who else would
profit from Marshs death and who
know enough about he personal life
to know that putting cocaine in the
nasal spray would be fatal

so where do we start

i want you to hit all the dealer in
town
give they a list of people
close to marsh and see if any of they
use
then i want you to check out a
doctor alan paley
he life up in
Roseburg

the week before and be wearing it in
a sling

i
should not be going to you house

be it against the law

we might as well do it someplace
nice

be not it beautiful

yeah

andrew loved this old cabin
he always dream about moving to
tahiti live in a hut and
becoming a beachbum
i could never imagine myself do
that but somehow when he talk
about it he make it sound so alive
so wonderful
soft ocean breeze
and beautiful sunset leaving the
world and it be problem behind
i
wish he would have a chance to do it

sorry

it be okay

tell i about doctor paley

i hardly know he
he wanted i and
he could not have i

it be going to be hard to convince a
jury that he be testify against you
in a murder trial because you blow
he off

it will not be that hard


do you always want to be a lawyer

no i wanted to be a professional
hockey player

really

yeah

that seem so far away from who you
be now
what happen

i broke i ankle skating
that end
that dream

it be hard to let go of a dream be not
it
to let go of what you want

i be going to put the car away
you
can let yourself in
there be a key
under the flower pot


yes it would be nice

what would

you and i making love

be that what you think i be
think

no that be what i know you be
think

how often do you make love to you
wife frank
once a week
sometimes
twice
there once be passion
be not there
but now it be bland
predictable
tell i when you do it
do you always think of she
or do
you wonder what it would be like to
be with someone else
someone wild
someone who would force you to lose
control

there be nothing wrong in admitting
that you want i frank

you take a lot for grant


please stay frank
i do not want to
be alone
i do not expect anything
from you no demand no
complication

i be trying

frank this be harvey willows from
the

time
he would like to ask you
a few question

it be an incredible story going on
here
as if quoting a
headline

new meaning to the state nickname

what be the state nickname

i worked for mr
marsh for six year
he be a good man until she come
along

what changed

horse to water but you can not make he
drink but you hold a pail of water
in front of an old horse for long
enough and well

you do not really believe what the
district attorney be saying about
miss lawson do you

i do not know
it be incredible to
think that anyone could be capable of
do that but if anyone could it
would be rebecca

i take it you do not like miss lawson
very much

i really do not know she that well
we would say hello to each other when
i would come to the house but that
be about it

if you do not know she that well what
make you think she be capable of
murder

andrew be a kind and gentle man but
he be thirty year old than she
where be the attraction to sleep with
someone like that to have the kind
of sex they have


how do you know what kind of sex they
have

i be not lookin through the keyhole
if that be what you be think
i would
come to house sometimes to pick up
paper or speak to andrew
i would find
they little toy all over the place

do mr
marsh use drug

no

what about miss lawson

yes cocaine

how do you know that

i be at the house one morning i
think miss lawson be upstairs with
mr
marsh
when i go into the
guest bathroom she be standing in
front of the mirror pouring this
white powder out of a vial

be something wrong

what
no nothing
thank you for
you time


you lie to i

what

i just left joanne Braslow
she told
i she see you do cocaine at
Marshs house

she be mistake

that be not good enough Goddamit

it be not true
you have to believe
i

no i do not have to believe you
the
jury have to believe you and answer
like he be lying or she be mistake
be not going to convince they

i do not use cocaine anymore
if she
say she see i do it she be lying

why would she lie

i do not know frank but do not you
think that be something we should find
out


michael get off the phone

why

because i be expect a call

but it be sunday

i know what day it be
get off the
phone

hurt
into phone
i get to go
i will call you later

this be rebecca lawson
i be not in
right now
so if you please leave a
message

i called you all weekend
where be
you

i go out on the boat


alone

of course

this trial by it very nature be
explosive
the press be going to
have a field day and i will not
tolerate any activity in i courtroom
that will fuel it
to Dulaney and
cardenas
both of you be going to be delve
into very personal aspect of people
live
i warn you now
when you do
so if you cannot establish a clear
line of relevancy early on in you
examination i will stop you
be
that clear

mr
cardenas

you all can see the defendant
rebecca lawson
but as this trial
proceed you will see that she be not
only the defendant she be the
murder weapon itself

stop and think for
a moment
be that possible
can a person
actually be a weapon
the answer be
yes
if i hit you and you die i
be the because of you death
but can
sex be called a weapon
yes
and
what a deadly weapon rebecca lawson
make of it
the state will prove
that miss lawson seduce andrew marsh
that she put increasing sexual
demand on he while she secretly
administer cocaine
all the while
knowing that he have a severe heart
condition
she be a beautiful woman but when
this trial be over you will see she
no differently than a gun or a knife
or any other instrument used as a
weapon
she be a killer
and the
bad kind one who disguise
herself as a love partner

mr
Dulaney

i know what you be think and
it be a mistake
you look at miss
lawson and you see a beautiful woman
who be involved with an old man
and you think she look like the
type
she could have do it
and
that be exactly what the district
attorney want you to think
yes
she be beautiful
so what
do
that make she a killer
of course
not
this case be not about
appearance
it be about fact
as mr
cardenas present he case you
will see that there be very few
fact that the bulk of the states
evidence be circumstantial
i be
confident that by the conclusion of
this trial you will not just have a
reasonable doubt
you will have no
doubt at all that rebecca lawson
be innocent of the charge against
she


doctor mccurdy what be the because of
death

massive cardiac arrest

what be mr
Marshs physical
condition prior to he death

very poor
he be suffering from
severe arterial disease

be the heart attack the result of
natural cause

no

what induced it

we find a high concentration of
cocaine in he blood

so mr
marsh used cocaine

i do not think so
the membrane in
he nasal passage do not show any
sign of long time usage

then how do it get into he body

we find a bottle of Dristan nasal
spray on the nightstand
it be
filled with water and cocaine
mr
marsh have a head cold at the time of
he death
i believe he be not aware
that he be ingest cocaine


be this the bottle that be find on
the nightstand

yes

you honor the state enter this
evidence as exhibit
be any fingerprint find on the
bottle

yes those of mr
marsh and a thumb
print of miss Lawsons

dr
mccurdy what would cocaine do to
someone in mr
Marshs condition

increase he heart rate

and if he be in the midst of
making love while under the influence
of cocaine

it would be an add stress to his
heart

what would be the effect if someone
secretly administered cocaine to mr
marsh and then induced he to make
love

it would be the same as shooting a
gun at he

thank you doctor mccurdy
you witness


can you say with any certainty that
mr
marsh do not ing the cocaine
himself

no but it seem highly unlikely
that a man in he condition would use
cocaine

that be you opinion doctor but
i be asking you if there be any
scientific test that can tell who
actually put the cocaine into the
Dristan bottle

no

thank you

doctor trammel when do you first
diagnose that mr
marsh have heart
disease


about a year and half ago

do mr
marsh change he lifestyle
after that


yes he stopped smoking and
drink and exercise regularly

he do everything he could to take
care of he heart


yes


do miss lawson ever accompany mr
marsh to you office


yes

just one last question
what do
the sign on you office door say


doctor steven trammel
cardiologist

dr
trammel do you ever speak to
miss lawson about mr
Marshs
condition


no

do mr
marsh ever tell you that he
have spoken to miss lawson about he
illness


no

do miss lawson ever accompany mr
marsh inside during he examination


no

then you have no way of knowing what
mr
marsh told miss lawson be the
reason for he visit


no
no i do not


how long be you mr Marshs personal
secretary

six year

be feeling about losing what might
be he last chance for love
that
what he really be saying be that
the uncertainty of she leave be
driving he crazy and if it do not

that
if she do leave he heart could not
take it

i do not know

someone who could

i be just curious to see if mr
Troxell reconstruct anything else

you honor please

i will see both of you in i chamber
right now


mr
Dulaney before you cast
aspersion on the district attorney
office by suggest they have coax
this witness to say thing that
be not true you well have more
than a hunch
do you

no you honor

maybe you do not know what it be like
where mrs
crawford come from but
i do
i come from a neighborhood
just like hers
this be a whole
other world for she
she be a poor
work woman who have be thrust
into a room full of highly educated
and mostly unsympathetic people
so
she put on she good dress fix she
hair and try to present herself as
intelligently as possible
be poor and have pride be not a
crime mr
Dulaney and before you
attempt to impeach another witness
testimony in i courtroom you
foundation well be base on
something other than semantics

i be surprise you can walk after the
way burnham chewed you ass out this
afternoon

i have get work to do

hey the belle sound
it be
between round

i do not hear it


what be happening to you frank
you be acting like you be on trial
here
this have become personal to
you

back off john

you be sleeping with she be not you

that be ridiculous

i be talking to you as a friend now
do not ruin you life you career for
she
she will spit you out when this
be over

you do not know what you be talking
about

really
what do an attorney speak
to he client about at she house
until three of the clock in the morning

you have be following i

she
it be an obvious move
i be
building a case against she
remember

if you head be not up you ass you
would have think of it too
you be
losing perspective
get out while
you can before she take you down
with she


i have be waiting for you to get
back

you get something on the coke

no but i get something

during lunch i be watch some of
Marshs home video

he be really into recording this
stuff
the

s office find a box
full of tape

this girl have really get some move
huh

if you want to get you kick go to a
video store and rent a porno movie

this tape be recorded over an
exist recording


over what

i would have missed it but the
phone ring and i let it play while i
talk
it look like blank tape
but it be not
it be be erase
without any input signal coming in

so what good be it to we if it be
be erase

it be very good because when the

as office see it they assumed it
be the end of the tape otherwise
they would have buried it

why

because it have not all be erase

where be the attraction to sleep with
someone like that

i need to speak with you


i do not think we have anything more
to talk about mr
Dulaney

you be sleeping with marsh

who told you that

he video taped you

that bastard

i think he be a kind gentle man

cast on the tape

of course i be hurt
he switched i off like a little toy
he be finished playing with

do not kill he


i be a practical woman mr
Dulaney
kill andrew be not in i good
interest
as it be i be out of a job
and i be not in he will

money be not the only reason people
commit murder miss Braslow

the state call jeffery Roston

you honor i do not see a mr
Roston
listed as a prosecution witness

the states investigation just
uncovered mr
Roston yesterday
afternoon in chicago

you honor mr
Roston be an exlover
of miss Lawsons

why do not the states investigation
uncover mr
Roston early

he be away on an extended vacation
and just return two day ago

alright i be going to allow his
testimony


but you honor

that be it mr
Dulaney
take a seat

mr
Roston what be you
relationship with miss lawson

we be lover

how long be you together

for about one year

how would you describe you sex life
with miss lawson

intense

i know this be a very personal
subject but could you be a little
more specific

it be wild
she be constantly
trying to get i more and more work
up kinky thing
i tried to
satisfy she the good i could but it
be difficult in i condition

what kind of condition be you
refer to

i have a bad heart


what happen next

i have bypass surgery

and how be you now

fine
the doctor say if i keep
taking care of myself i can live to
be a very old man

how do you relationship with miss
lawson progress after the surgery

it do not

why not

she left i

why do she say she be leaving

she do not
she just left

why do you think she left you

well i think that after the
operation she realized that


objection
the question call for a
conclusion on the part of the
witness

you honor mr
Roston live with the
defendant for many month
i feel
that he opinion be valid in
substantiate the character of the
miss lawson

the opinion of a scorn lover be
hardly an objective view

objection sustained

do miss lawson ever give you any
indication why she be leaving

objection
the witness have already
stated that miss lawson left without
an explanation

mr
cardenas i suggest you move on
to another line of questioning

when you say you sexual relation
with miss lawson be intense what
exactly do you mean

it be like she be trying to push i
as far as she could
she called it
opening new door

can you give the court an example

it be like sex be a game to she
she get off on the control
she
always used to tell i it have to be
she way


it be hard to resist a woman as
beautiful as she be

what would she do that make it hard
to resist

she be a woman who be very much aware
of she own sexuality
sometimes i
feel she could read i mind
it be
uncanny how she know exactly what i
wanted
few night before i heart
surgery rebecca wake i
she have
handcuff i to the bed

she told i that tonight we be
going to open new door
i ask she
to stop to take off the handcuff
but she would not listen

what do she say

mr
Roston i know this be difficult
for you but it be important you tell
the court what she do

she said she be going to fuck i
like i have never be fucked before

due to the sensitive nature of this
witness testimony and the inability
of the spectator to allow he to
complete it i be clearing the
courtroom


what do she do next mr
Roston

she start touching herself and
telling i how much she wanted i
she reach down and put i inside
she
i doctor have warn i about
exert myself but you really
do not think of those thing at a
moment like that
you just think
about how beautiful this woman be
how much you want she
how deeply
you want to please she
at first it start off slowly but
the rhythm build and build
every
time i get close to an orgasm she
would stop
eventually i start to
have trouble breathe
rebecca just
keep going fast and fast
no
matter what i said she would not stop
i really think for a moment i be
going to die

if you know it be bad for you why
do you do it

i could not help myself
you get lost
inside a woman like she
it be like
a drug
it be the good sex i ever
have

what happen after that

i wake up the next morning and she
be go

do you change you will while you
be with miss lawson


yes

who be you primary beneficiary

she be

thank you
the state rest

mister Dulaney

mister Dulaney

mr
Roston you said it be the good
sex you ever have
be that the good
sex with a woman or a man

objection

i will rephrase the question
mr

i used to work at
Roseburg memorial hospital
dr
Paleys on staff there

what be the nature of you
relationship with dr
paley

we dated for about a month last year

then what happen

i realized he be not serious
he be
seeing other woman asking other
nurse at the hospital out so i
end it


and what do dr
paley do after
you stopped seeing he

he used to call i tell i that i
could not just walk out on he
he
said that if i do not come back he would
make i life miserable

do he make you life miserable

yes he do

how

objection
may i remind mr
Dulaney
that the person on trial here be miss
lawson not dr
paley

you honor i be trying to establish a
pattern in dr
Paleys behavior with
woman

objection overrule
the witness
will answer the question

he would call i in the middle of the
night
show up at i house and bang
on the door
finally after two week
i go to he office one day to tell
he to stop

what do he say

he laugh and basically said he
would decide when it be over

do you remember he exact word


yes
he said if you want to play
game we will play and you will be
sorry


what happen next

while i be seeing dr

joanne Braslow be get more and
more interesting
i follow she
today to an attorney office
joseph koehler

joe koehler

he be an
estate attorney and he be very
expensive

what would joanne Braslow need with
an estate attorney
she be not even
mention in Marshs will

not this will


here it be
accord to the old
will joanne Braslow be to inherit
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollar

what good do that do it be the
old will

under the law a person cannot profit
from they own wrong doing
since
rebecca lawson be the sole
beneficiary of the new will if she
be find guilty the will be void and
joanne Braslow could make a very good
case to have the old will reinstate

she kill the old man and make it
look like miss lawson do it
pretty
slick

i be think that when the trial be
over we would all go skiing for a
weekend

maybe it would be a good idea if you
just take michael

drug store


mr
Dulaney be you ready to call

introduced cocaine as one of the
contributing reason mr
marsh die
how it may have be introduced into
the household be of vital importance

be you able to back up this
allegation or be you fishing

i can back it up

attention to you

and that he changed he will

yes

mr
Dulaney

the prosecution case be build on
theory speculation
could rebecca
lawson have do this
be it
possible that she do that
where be
the fact
the evidence
the state
have presented two spurn lover and
a jealous secretary
hardly what i
would call impartial witness
where be one shred of conclusive
irrefutable evidence
i do not see it
and i do not think you do either
do you know why
because there be not
any

what be the issue here
that rebecca
lawson like wild sex
no
but the
district attorney be trying to make
you think if rebecca lawson could
stray from the path of normal
accept sexual behavior then she
could be capable of murder
do she
force andrew marsh to make love to
she
do she hold a gun to he head
no
andrew marsh wanted she and
why would not he
she be beautiful
alluring the type of woman man
dream about

it be human nature
we want what we
want when we want it
we do not
think about the consequence of we
action
when desire fill we we all
do thing that we know be bad for
we
we live for the moment
here be an exciting young woman who
unlock door
door that lead into
a new world
world he entered
willingly eagerly
he wanted to
please she and so he do not tell
she of he illness
i know it might
be difficult for you to understand
wanting something so badly that you
be will to risk everything but
that be what passion do to you
it be a fire uncontrollable
it
consume you and the only thing
you can do be let it burn
andrew
marsh let it burn
it be he life
he choice and maybe he mistake
but making love be not a crime
we all have fire inside we secret
desire
we guard they hold they
in the cage that we have build
when
someone come along and open the
gate they rush out and feed blindly
on they pleasure
rebecca lawson
loved andrew marsh
she do not kill
he if anything do it be his
own passion


it be true we all have fire
burning inside we
rebecca lawson
be very aware of the fire burn
inside andrew marsh and she stoke
those flame fan they until
they burned so hot that reason and
judgement left he
be making love a
crime
of course not but the
question be not as simple as that
rebecca lawson used she seductive
quality to entice andrew marsh
she used sex as a catalyst and
cocaine as the terminus
the
combination of the two provide the
conclusion of a premeditate act
she ask dr
paley about cocaine
she fingerprint be find on the
nasal spray bottle that contained the
cocaine and she be the sole
beneficiary of andrew Marshs will
she planned it from beginning to end
she know about he heart
she
secretly administered cocaine then
used wild and physically demanding
sex to induce a heart attack
making love be an act of passion
between two people to affirm they
vow of love
this be not an act of
love this be an act of greed
this be betrayal
rebecca lawson
killed andrew marsh and i be
counting on you to punish she for
that crime

they be back already
it be only be
three hour


lady and gentleman of the jury
