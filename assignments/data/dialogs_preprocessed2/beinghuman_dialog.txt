and as he stare at the sky and listen to a cow
moo almost dreamily in a distant village he tried to
understand what it all mean the sky and the field
and the hum telegraph pole
he feel that he be just
at the point of understanding it when he head start to
spin and the lucid languor of the moment become
intolerable

in this script there be six main character who inhabit
different period of time from prehistory to the
present day
but there be just one story
because we
blend into one develop narrative the live that we
show
there be no suggestion of time travel or reincarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device
we can do in real
time and with real character what other movie strive to
do with immortal time traveller and ghost
we story
be thoroughly base in reality and the magic we be
dealing with be real human magic
in moving from one character to the next everything will
change
support character setting period
but the
essential situation of we hero of the moment will relate
to the one before and the one follow
the magic will be in the transition in leaving one
character and advancing the film through hundreds or
thousands of year to find we next hero in tantalizingly
similar human circumstance
the effect of these transi
tion across space and time will let the audience grasp
the simple truth behind we story
that we be all in it
together
the key to allow the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film be that one actor
will play the six individual
the feel will be of
the endless glorious play and replaying of the simple
drama of be alive
we end the film with a presentday hero but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light feeling he kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the other who have go before
the resolution of
he contemporary story be theirs also
by then perhaps
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec
tive too
and the structure of the film itself have the thrill of
novelty
it have never before be used in cinema
never
we six character and they story connect in
many different way some obvious other vague tanta
lizing thread
even global connection be make as the
planet itself and all it people come and go in the
story
for the audience the game of making the connec
tion feeling the bond even invent or discover
association of they own will be endless in this big
gest of story small of story
it be truly a new
cinematic experience



hector be a family man
he and he woman and two
child live near the ocean in a shelter fold on a
hillside a shallow cave given protection at it entrance
by a cover of branch and brush
just inside a small
fire smoulder permanently a few time a day encourage
into life for cook or warmth
if it ever go out it
would be a catastrophe so it remains a smoulder com
fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family
hector do not know that he name be hector
it be
simply a convenience to help we tell he story
the idea
of individual name be an imaginative leap that have not
yet be make by mankind when we first meet he
hector
be living out he life year before the birth of
christ in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet
in
he entire life hector will traverse no more than ten
square mile of it


be the reflection of Hectors face in a rock pool
the
image suddenly fragment
hector be enjoy himself
deflect he stream of pee now and then so that he
image reform itself and then be disrupted again
when
he be finished a trace of vanity make he bend down
closer to he reflection
he stroke he long hair and
finger a blemish on he cheek
then he be aware of another presence
he sharply turn
some way off a solitary figure stand on the rise of some
rock not afraid to show itself
hector call out

go back home
leave i alone
we see that the figure be a young Hectors son
the
boy think about it for a moment before turning and
disappearing behind the rock

the small fire that never go out have be enlarged to
cook the day meal
beyond the fire on a rock shelf
play with he child a of six and boy of
eight
it be the usual rough romp that father indulge
in but in possibly rough than normal
hector
be acting the part of some trap wild animal lash
out at the hunter surrounding he
but in he act of
wild rage he get carry away
he pick up he son and
throw he hard much too hard on he back




the boy tumble down from the shelf to the cave floor at
he mother DEIRDREs foot howling in pain
deidre
scowl at hector
if the gesture have be invent he
would probably shrug he shoulder
the boy howl on
hector kneel beside he daughter absorbed in she antic
as she sleep
she be a vivid dreamer
she whole little
form wriggle and contort in response to the fantasy
unspool in she head
she emit unearthly nighttime
noise squeal and giggle and moan
hector be fasci
nated
where have he daughter go
who be this strange
wild creature that have taken she form lying beside he
Hectors daughter delight he
and while hector watch
he daughter deirdre from they bed watch hector
it be almost dawn the cave be quiet and the fire have
diminished
by it light we see deirdre and hector making
love on they bed of dry grass and skin
it be diffi
cult to say what they lovemake might look like
what
have year do to that art
we will think about it
on the far side of the cave we see the sleep child
as we we see that they be far from sleep
two set of bright eye peek out from under they cover
we they the love parent and the watch
learn child
hector be argue with he son just outside they cave
the boy want to go foraging with he again

no
stay here
stay
hector take a few step
the boy follow

no
go back
go away
hector walk on again taking big angry father stride
the boy stubbornly tag along at a safe distance
hector
walk on for some time before turning on he

leave i alone
stay here
stay
there be real anger in he voice
the boy wisely
retreat to the cave
as hector turn to continue his
walk alone he see deirdre looking at he accusingly from
the entrance
she hold out she arm ready to comfort
the boy rejected by he father
hector be in the
classic timeless nowin situation and he know it
with a sigh of frustration he head for the beach




hector be foraging on the shoreline gather cockle
seaweed mussel crab anything edible
he splash
in the shallow hoard the food in a roughlywoven
bag
every now and then he will suck a cockle from it
she will or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed
hector look about year old
this be advance middle
age for he time and it show
he have a heavy cold and
an irritate hack in he throat
in a similar condition
a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
drug day in bed perhaps attempting a little light
paperwork prop up on some pillow
the sun be warming the day
hector sit on a rock sur
veying he world
he seem very much a part of it
he
watch some wading seabird nearby
like he they be
nose around the margin of low tide for food
he
smile
in another season they or they egg will pro
vide a meal or two
there be a strange atmosphere of
appropriateness in the scene hector seem such an inte
gral part of it
the easy fit of the man in he land
scape strike we
hector belong to it in way that a
presentday hunter or holiday maker or even naturalist
never could
also there be an odd sense of the world
be rather empty
whether the large world be round or flat spinning or
orbit hector neither know nor care
he know
simple thing
cold and hunger
he know warmth rough
comfort and companionship
he family and the safety of
they cave
further/far along the shore hector drop he bag and straigh
tens himself ease the ache in he back
then some
thing disturb he
from behind a distant headland a
smudge of smoke trail into the sky
hector pick up he
bag and run
he know where he be going
he reach a
vantage point on some rock
he steady himself and
gaze hard out to sea
we can feel the strain in his
eye as he try to detect any hint of threat in the
glint water
then he jaw drop in fear
around the
edge of the headland two dark shape proceed in regular
motion
they steady progress be full of menace
oar
drive boat slowly insistently making they way into
Hectors bay
he jump from the rock and run up the
beach toward the cave
one thing else that hector know
be fear blind gutturning fear


hector be a small figure in the landscape now racing up
the steep slope in the direction of he home




he stop for breath and to look back on the bay
the
shape be distinct now two large open boat roughly
make but menacingly adequate for they purpose coastal
raiding
the boat be near the beach now and figure
can be see preparing to land
hector gather enough of
he wit and strength to continue he race up the
hillside


inside he family be in a state of panic
they seem to
have prepared for this moment
through they agitation
there be purpose
they gather bit and piece to carry
with they in they flight
Hectors child be attemp
ting to take too much
hector shout instruction to
they as he put more wood on the fire
it must stay
burning in they absence
hector gather he family together and they leave the
cave


hector shove he child in one direction up the slope
**further/far into the hill
he woman run off the other
way
hasty confuse argument take place

up the hill

no down onto the other beach
the little one can not take the
hill
neither can i

up the hill
they be down there
already
i see they

you be wrong
she run off down the slope
hector have no choice but to
follow she herd the child in front of he
deirdre run on heading for the low slope and the cover
of some tree
then from these same tree she see the
figure of the coming toward she
she turn
running back up the hill
hector and the child also
turn and run back the way they have come by now dropping
precious bit of food and other possession
the raider
be running strongly five or six of they

in the privacy of they tent dom paulo and he son be
engaged in they nightly ritual practice on they
recorder
dom paulo lead the young boy through an
intricate pretty tune
they sit formally and there be
an air of stoicism about they determined as they be
to maintain they civilized habit in these bleak of
circumstance
but there be also a feel of madness
about it
the madness of a man who have lost a grip of
what be going on about he
down on the beach man be
waiting to die in the morning on he order
the blend
of formality and madness make the scene comic


the sun have rise sharply soaring out of the ocean
it
blind the eye of those in the little execution party
making they way along the beach
the crosscumscaffold have be erect some way from the
camp
most people be attending to they morning
chore with one eye on the grim act of justice be
carry out along the shore
we view of the hanging will be from the distance of the
camp
marionette figure man dancing on rope the form
ality of legal death
the priest and the executioner
it take a while for the people in the camp to become
aware of the other observer up on the dune
three
figure stand in full view boldly silently watch
the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold
the word pass around the camp
eye pass between the
execution and the tall native watch
the first man
be already dangle on the rope by the time that dom paulo
and he officer be discuss the appearance of the
native

some gunpowder would scatter they
sir

no they might want to be
friendly
they will have food
too
get one of we african
slave
we must try and talk to
they
if they think we be timid
we be dead



solitary make he way up from the camp to the
native on the dune
everyone in the camp watch as he
approach they
there be tension
will the native run
or fight or talk
they begin to talk
the native seem
most interest in the hanging and point in that
direction asking question
the slave make an attempt
at explaining what be happening but the native seem
baffle
they start laughing and shaking they head
by now the second figure be dangle on the rope the
cross making an efficient doublegallows


while Franciscos attention have be on the native
hector have sidle up to he still hope to ingratiate
himself
he talk while they watch the two event the
hanging and the meet

i hate it when people have to die


it be foolishness
kill we
own man when we have the whole of
africa to face

it be foolish squabble at all
we should be friend
francisco look at he for the meaning in what he be
saying
hector shrug
he take a small bundle from
he jacket and give it to francisco

what be this

some bread and raisin

i think everything be shared
out on the raft

well this be not
it be for she
and you
francisco look hector straight in the eye looking for
he angle
but this time there be none
hector be
simply a lonely man seeking to retrieve lose friendship
there be a glimmer of sympathy in Franciscos face



on the high dune the slave and the native have now
parted company
the deserter still spin at the end of
they rope the priest praying at they foot
francisco walk away from he
hector call out

i must speak to she


the slave approach dom paulo outside he tent

they want to make a visit here
with they king
he will bring
gift and will receive gift
they said not to sacrifice anymore
man for they
they do not like
that
dom paulo and the other laugh


the tide be sweeping more wreckage into the bay
barrel
and box and timber bob in the wave
people make they
way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gift from the
sea

salgado show a handful of nail from a small sack in his
hand

organize some man to gather all
the nail they can find

to keep control of that particular
currency
dom paulo rummage in a box of cheap rosary select a
couple and then retire to he tent
the other work
on at the table
hector drift off down to the beach


inside he tent dom paulo go to he small mirror
he
take off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
around he neck and a valuable brooch from he coat
he
stow they safely in a lock box and replace it in it
hide place in the sand floor
then he adorn himself
in the cheap rosary and other trashy item
dom paulo
catching sight of he watch son in the mirror hold
a silencing finger to he mouth



hector be walking along the beach close to a pile of
discard box and crate



he quickly search through they
he soon find what he
be looking for a piece of wood with some nail still
attached to it
he pull out the nail and pocket they
then continue to rummage amongst the wood for more
hector be a survivor
and not the first hector to
scavenge on a beach in a world that feel big and empty


hector be enjoy the freshness of the day
we see
he climb over a dune and then as he near the summit
duck and retreat down the slope again
cautiously he
crawl up the dune and look over to the other side
he be watch a young girl and the boy nuno
they be
twelve or thirteen year old
they be coyly in the
early stage of making love the boy lying close to the
girl kiss she begin to caress she
they
lovemake be poised oddly between childes play and
eroticism
it be they day of discovery and it be like
a dream of love
the boy be just about to discover some more and be
fumble with the girl clthe when he look up and
catch sight of hector
hector duck down but know he
have be see and decide to brazen it out
he stand
up in full view of they

stop that
leave she alone
get back to the camp
or i will tell
you mother
how can you play like
this when there be people need
you help back there
the boy be standing now and fix he clthe
he walk
off back to the camp
the girl remains sitting in the
sand button she dress too embarrass even to raise
she head to hector
then hector be touched by something perhaps the sad stoop
in the boy shoulder or the girl lowered head
hector
realize he have broken something precious and in they
circumstance infinitely fragile and irretrievable
he
feel like an oaf
he call after the boy

come back
i do not mean it
it be a joke
you come back
she be still here
i will not say
anything



but the boy walk on turning around now and then to look
at hector who feel foolish and mean
hector call down
to the girl

i be sorry
but she do not look up still fumble with she button
hector curse quietly and look out across the dune
angry with himself
then he see the procession of the
native king and he people some cattle and porter
carrying basket
hector run off towards the camp


the meet of the two leader be weird and wonderful
to see
the rag european already scanning the
basket of the native for sign of solid food
somehow still muster an absurd sense of they own
importance for the occasion
the native excite and
curious trying to contain they exuberance so that they
do not miss a single detail of this most significant
day
many of the native have climb into the tree
either out of timidity or to get a good view
the tree around the meet place be dripping with
body like human fruit
hector slip into the crowd as the be in
midspeech
when he have stopped talking the slave begin
to haltingly translate

he be excite when he hear you
have come but he want to know
if you be real people
he
do not think you would be such
a strange color
so he want
to see you
he point repeatedly at he navel


so that he will know that you
be born like real people



dom paulo will not suffer the indignity alone
he talk to
the officer standing closest to he

right
you four as well
he begin to open up he coat and shirt
the four
officer do the same
the king and a few of he atten
dants take a step or two forward and peer at the expose
white european belly
they look at one another and
mumble solemnly
then they step back
dom paulo and the
officer fix they clthe and remuster they dignity
the king be enjoy himself
he speak again to the
slave who then translate

he want to see you breathe
the king take a deep breath then nod to dom paulo
dom paulo and the officer do as they be tell
the king
join they and for a few moment there be a kind of
communion between they
then everyone join in
it be a
strange poignant moment all the native and all the
european united in the simple act of breathe
dom paulo regain he composure
he speak to the slave

tell he that we want to trade
with he to buy food
and we
want he to guide we out of here
we have a long way to travel
to
where the white man have they
big ship
the slave speak to the king
the king listen and talk
back for a long time
then the slave translate again

he have hear of white man very
very far away
this way
but you have to cross many river
twenty big river

tell he i want to give he these
dom paulo step forward to the king
an officer bring
a wrap cloth
dom paulo open it letting the king
see the piece of break copper inside




the officer produce a handful of large nail and
give they directly to the king
the king nod his
head in approval and show the nail to he attendant
they be impress

and tell he that i want to
make he a very special gift as
one king to another
various officer raise they eyebrow at this

of these precious thing which i
father and forefather have worn
for many long year before
dom paulo solemnly and without a blush remove the cheap
rosary from around he neck and offer it to the king

i should not do this but it be
such a special occasion and he be
such a great and worthy king
this be translate
the king refuse to accept the
rosary
instead he be pointing to a couple of chunky
and valuablelooking ring on dom paulos finger which
he have forgotten to remove

he say he could not accept such
a treasure gift something of
such value to you family
instead he would be happy to take
one or two of the old ring you have
on you finger
but please do
not insist that he take you
necklace
it be impossible to know if the king be be naively
polite or hugely clever
dom paulos officer enjoy a
mute titter as he peel off he precious ring and
give they to the king replace the worthless bauble
around he own neck
the king begin talking again
the slave translate

he will give you guide to help
you across the first of the big
river
it be ten day from
here




thank you thank you
the slave continue

and he ask you to be ready
to leave the beach in two day
time
he cannot permit you to
stay longer
dom paulo look shock

because with the new moon the
turtle will arrive and lay
they egg
you may frighten
they
you must be go
the mention of turtle egg almost turn the stomach
of most of the survivor even the fit one
the king and he follower walk back into the forest

soon the survivor be alone again with the lose
looking cow the native have left
doom cow if
ever there be


the remain of the cow hang on the spit over the large
fire the survivor have make on the beach
small group
of people sit around it gnawing on the roast flesh
the image be once again timeless the element of it
simple
man fire flesh food
one cow do not go far between a hundred starve people
some be still on they foot by the large fire
now and
then a hand will dart out over the flame to snatch a
bone hanging loose or a tastylooking piece of gristle
they be the survivor of the pack if any will be
hector be of course among they
he risk the searing
heat to pull at a couple of blacken bone
he see
nuno the boy he chase away from the girl early in
the day
nuno be sitting by himself stare vacantly
at the fire licking he finger
hector sit down in the sand beside he
nuno hardly
notice he until hector offer he one of he bone
nuno grab it

nuno look at he smile weakly
then he turn away
in silence
hector try another approach to win the
boy over

i have a boy like you

hector try

posture of worship itself
they begin to sing a low
rhythmic compel chant
it mingle with the distant
voice of father diogo and then with the chant voice
of all the european until it seem that the whole
world be praying


next morning the camp on the beach be be broken up

hector and bobby sit by the fire with they supper
they
be both anxious but pretend not to be





even if we lose they track we will
still hit the river
we can not
miss that

it be too high for indian

much too high
you will not find an
indian up here
we just have to
keep we head
no panic

if you do find an indian what
would he be

you would not
but he might be a
delaware if you do

we keep working

why not
we can log the peak on
the far side just a couple of
sighting a day
keep we busy
they force tone of matteroffactness only serve to
heighten the grow feel of doom

you think we will get out

if we keep we head
i wish i
have some tobacco


hector be lying awake watch Bobbys sleeping form on
the ground at the other side of the die fire
behind
bobby be a wolf sniff and edging he way closer to
they
hector be not anxious
he know the wolf will soon
become aware of they and move off
he be worry about
something else
from under the pack that make his
pillow he pull a piece of break arrow a shaft and some
feather the other end of Bobbys find
he look at it
then look back to bobby and the wolf



in the morning hector and bobby be taking reading from
the instrument they have hung on a large tree main
taining the discipline of they work
it give some
shape and meaning to they predicament

barometer
twentyeight and
threeeighths
temperature

low
thirtyfour
high
fortytwo and a half
time
hector write it in the log book
bobby go to the
horse and take a brass chronometer from a box strapped
to the saddle
hector take out a small chronometer
from he own pack
they compare reading
there be a
difference of some four or five minute in the time

it be get bad
you be
nearly five minute fast now

i be not fast
you be slow
down
they obviously have this tiff every morning

what be the point of have two
chronometer when you do not take
the average

exactly
you should throw yours
away

you be unscientific bobby
at
heart
hector write in the book
he speak pointedly

seven twentyfive
bobby mock he with a laugh



bobby be leading the horse and hector walk on ahead

the go be easy through the fern and grass
bobby
for a moment forget he apprehension and start to sing
loudly





i see she in the dewy flower
i see she sweet and fair
he voice ring sharply around the forest
hector far
ahead turn around taken by surprise
bobby have
frighten himself too
he eye the forest all around
as the echo of he voice fade
chastened he begin
to sing again quietly this time under he breath

there be not a bonny bird that sing
but mind i o i jeans


hector and bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
looking out across the broad valley
they be building a pile of stone a cairn
they work
quietly methodically
the only sound be of they
breathe and the of the stone
we feel the
echo of we many previous Hectors and they pile of
stone build for this or that purpose
we doom
surveyor be acting out the same ritual this time in
the name of science
they finish the cairn and erect they heavy tripod over
it and dangle a plumb line from the tripod
bobby
scratch the center point on the top stone of the cairn
they be establishing a survey point
they talk as they
work
when they anchor they tripod the cold hard sound of
they all through the forest
it unnerve they
they stop hammer and listen to the
down the valley

sure this be a good idea

let we get out of here
they hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the
horse in an atmosphere of control panic


they be travelling together now on either side of the
horse nose finding comfort in the closeness of each
other
they stop for bobby to consult he compass




he indicate a slight change of direction and they move
off again
still they do not talk
we can feel they
anxiety breed in the silence
why do not they talk
they proceed in this weighty silence but even the
of the now seem to mock they
the route take they downhill
the slope be more dense
with undergrowth now and the go be not so easy
some
time they be reduced to an undignified scramble hanging
onto the bulk of the horse between they
they no longer
look much like conqueror of the wilderness


they be on the valley floor now
the tree be more
openly space and the grass be rich
they be moving
quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
the trot
it have not see grass this good in week


they be moving more slowly the ground be rocky and
the tree be thickening
they take the easy way up the
hillside a natural path make by deer or bear
it be difficult to know who be more shaken by they
encounter the indian or hector and bobby
the be sitting behind a tree as they pass dozing
or deep in reverie
they almost pass without notice
he but hector give a turn of he head and there be the
indian four foot from he
at the same instant the indian
come to he sense and sit bolt upright
the encounter
be high comedy but full of terror for all of they
the indian stand up
hector absurdly greet he

hi
hello
the indian back off from they holding he hand up and
smile crazily as if to say do not mind i boy i be
just leaving
hector and bobby be equally silly in
they response

hey come back
we be just
moving through
do not
apologize
we all get a fright
goodbye




the indian be in full retreat now waving he hand about
apologetically but making good distance from they
suddenly he be go
it have happen so quickly that
hector and bobby scarcely believe it have happen
then
they realize that in they fright they have let go of the
horse
it have headed back down to the tasty pasture
in the valley
they see it disappearing into the tree
below they

that be stupid

do you see he

sure i see he

be he a delaware

how the fuck should i know
he
be an indian
and indian do not
come in one

i think he be an indian
too
what about the horse

i be not going back down there

do not panic bobby

why not
he run off into the forest
then he turn and shout to
hector

come on
hector follow he a mad race through the forest


hector and bobby be sitting on a rock gathering they
wit
it be odd how they talk so matteroffactly

what do you see





same as you

an indian
with long hair

that be it
kind of short

purple glow in the air

we will not have a fire tonight

case it snow

what about bear without a fire
bobby laugh quietly

do not even think about bear hector




they be making a round frame of bend branch and cover
ing it with foliage
Halfhidden in the undergrowth it
be big enough for two man to huddle in
tonight they feel
the most basic of urge to curl up in a ball and hide


they be safe and snug in they hideaway
hector have light
he candle
he be reading he letter holding they close
to he eye in the dimness
he have the air of someone
putting he affair in order
bobby be think aloud

bobby walk off with great cloud of tobacco smoke
billow defiantly around he as if to challenge
they nighttime tormentor
hector take a last look at they shelter and it little
memorial cairn and then run to catch up with bobby


hector and bobby look vulnerable as they walk through
the open forest with they meager pack on they back

we can move quicker without the
horse
we just have to keep
moving
we have to get away from
here
behind they they do not see the figure moving from the
cover of one tree to another and then another figure
following the first
they move like ghost


bobby be a few step ahead of hector

over a rise and instantly return
he throw himself
and hector to the ground
hector try to struggle free

what be wrong

bobby turn to hector to make he point

the act of seeking cover looking absurdly embarrass
for the fleet moment that we see it

way to go over the rise through the woman and child
and across the stream
to the watch indian it look
like a direct attack on they family
from behind
tree and rock they emerge and begin the chase

tragedy of misunderstand



hector and bobby scatter the woman and child and
splash across the stream burning all they energy in
this mad lifeordeath race
although they family
be safe the indian keep up the chase the moment of
confusion compounded in action
they lope easily after
they waiting for the white man to tire
there be no
whoop or shout
they follow hector and bobby into the
tree spreading out on either side shaping the human
net that will soon engulf they
it be a menace spectacle
death be near
hector

an attractive woman be filling she car in
the next line
she eye and Hectors meet
for some
reason they exchange the small smile
for a few
brief moment they be talking without word as they

twinkle of an eye
by the time they credit card be

frighten
fascinated impotent
how can he help she
how could he
possibly unravel the secret of the pancake what comfort
could he offer he strange daughter if he do

aboard the rocket
as the attendant release the brake and crank they up
into the drizzle around and around hector know that he
have to do something to break the awful distance between
he and he kid
he look at they
they sit grimly in

she smile
hector be out of he depth with this
daughter of he

be that a joke

hector look at she in wonderment
one of those moment
when another human being stand before you and be an
utter mystery

who be you
who be inside
there

you will never know
future generation of woman be going to be just as
unknowable to we Hectors as past one be
betsy
move off briskly along the beach
hector trail
after she hook


betsy and thomas be in a small fragile rowboat some
distance from the shore
they be watch hector who
be collecting a pile of large stone on the beach
another hector and another pile of stone
this one
be making a fire for the barbecue
these human ritual
never stop

i think he be tall




well it be be a while
you be
big

i suppose so
he be get fat
too
i bet i could beat he at
the breaststroke now


hector turn from he work
out at sea the kid look
small and vulnerable
hector be more anxious than he
should be out of practice at fatherhood
he call to
they

come on in kid
that boat
do not look too safe
they call back to he

we be fine
hector try to relax but he do not have the
confidence yet or something
he be edgy

i have just find you
i do not
want to lose you
what would i
tell you mother
come on in
he walk down to the water
the kid reluctantly pull
on the oar and bring the little boat in
few foot
from the beach they hit some sand
the boat stick
hector wade out in he shoe so far
then he call
to thomas

throw i the rope thomas i will
pull you in
thomas throw the moor rope to hector
it be not
attached to the boat
hector end up with all of the
rope in he hand
he stand there and they all laugh

this be one useless piece of
rope thomas
just for a moment we have the image of we hector
standing on the shoreline with a length of rope
an
image with an echo from six thousand year ago
but
this time hector be laughing and he kid be safe




at the very moment of sunset betsy be trying to capture
it in a watercolor sketch
she have set up an easel on
the beach
it be like action paint
she work
frantically on the picture racing the sun as it dip
into the ocean
tough little betsy can even lose
patience with the sun

why do it always go so fast
thomas be laughing at she
he have see she attempt this
before
hector have other concern
he be trying to
light he barbecue
match after match disappear into
he elaborate stone structure only to fizzle out
the sun finally vanish and betsy go limp at she
easel
the sun have win the race again
she and thomas
watch hector trying to light the fire
after a while
he be conscious of they amuse attention on he then
he become a little selfconscious

i used to know how to do this
they laugh a little

i do
i used to be really
good at this
he waft and blow ineffectually at a flicker of flame
there be not much of the caveman about he now


it be a calm dusk
hector be turning the meat on the
barbecue
he be in a splendid frame of mind

ah
smell it
the smell of
civilization
scorched meat
hector serve the chicken onto they plate
he sit
down beside they with he steak and a glass of wine
he watch thomas attack he chicken and smile

i would forgotten that
how you
eat
dedicate
like it be
you religion

thing i like




you used to hum to yourself too
when you eat
like everything
be fine with the world
thomas try it out eating and humming
it feel good
to he
he head nod with the chew and the tune

hey so i do
i would forgotten
about that
the early star be appear in the sky
hector lift
he eye to a bright point low on the horizon

there she be
old mercury

no
mercury do not rise til
after midnight
that be jupiter
hector be impress by he son

i would forgotten
we used to watch
the star
you could tell i the
name of all the planet
you
could recite they like a poem
remember
at the tiny window
upstairs in the old house

no

oh well not to worry
i be glad
you still like astronomy though

i be not into stargaze so much
we be working on computer
model
we be trying to make
a biosphere

Uhhuh

selfsustaining life system
for interstellar travel
but we
always get a methane build up it
do not matter what we do





this be at school

yeah
we be making such a mess of
the world one day we be going to
have to take off for somewhere
else

sound like donald said that
hector realize how far he kid have travel from
he
he look at they

well i be glad you two be think
about the old planet
i be proud
of you
look how beautiful
everything be
sometimes i think
it be people that make it all
wrong
we walk around with all
we problem
betsy chime in

i do not know
if it be not for
we there would be nobody around to
see it all
hector stand to fetch another bake potato from the fire
we see the three of they in a the evening sky
now pulse with more and more point of light
Hectors
voice and laughter carry to we

do not worry you two
i will tell
you
it be just a big black
sheet up there with hole in it
so the light come through
that be the truth
the very
late
hector have come to rest and find peace at last however
temporary here on the beach beneath the same star that
we first hector wail at six thousand year ago
on monday he will face the music
the kid will go
back home mrs
Philippopolis will have to be deal with
and the wilt three hundred dollar bouquet of flower
in general life will take over on monday
but at this
moment of calm on the beach let we leave he while he be
ahead



they voice ring out playfully across the expanse of
darken beach and lightladen sky

wait a minute
i know
the
whole universe be inside a speck
of dust that be lying in a ball of
fluff in the cuff of a pair of
pants hanging over the back of a
chair

no
i will tell you
the whole
thing
star and everything
be sitting on the skin of a bubble
of milk in a bowl of cornflake
and somebody just about to eat
it
the three of they be laughing now

skimmed milk

you do not get bubble in skim
milk

okay
it be halfandhalf
perhaps that be just about as close as hector and he
tribe of human will ever come to working it all out
but they try


i have get a good one
we be
all inside a speck of pollen
that be stick to the wing of a bee
while it sit on a flower

do not mention flower betsy
please not tonight
and then after a long long pause


i have an idea betsy
we be
inside a pancake
what you
think





why be you always talking about
pancake
what be wrong with you


you have get pancake on the brain
