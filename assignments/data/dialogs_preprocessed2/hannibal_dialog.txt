speaking of the vacant post

dottore Fanelli

he have not by any chance wander back






now
we applicant hold in he hand
in he
dante Aligheri himself
would he
recognize it i think

you want the job for you nephew

indeed i do
because he be i nephew
no
because he

let he read the note

yes fine of course he can read the
note
he italian be admirable for a







the personality of preRenaissance
florence
i think






a dr
fall
brazilian i think
apply for Fanellis post

brazilian

it would seem

what if he come upon a note in the
capponi library this great italian
institution which he now grace we with
he bid to direct a note from guido de
cavalcanti
would he recognize it i
think not






would you care to address that dr
fall











cavalcanti reply publicly to Dantes
first sonnet
do you know it professor
Sogliato
i believe it be worth you
time
listen to the way he make an
instrument of the italian vernacular
which he called the
the eloquent voice of the people
allegro i sembrava amor tenedoMeo core
in mano e ne la braccia aveaMadonna
involta in un drappa dormedoPoi la
svegliava a desto ardenoLei paventosa
umilmente pasceaAppreso gir lo ne vedea
paingendo
if dante have written to a
cavalcanti it would of course have
be to andrea the most literary of his
brother

we be speaking of i



i be sorry

we be speaking of i

indeed we be

and i need for the institution

freud do you know
freud
psychoanalyzed patient in one afternoon

and how do he do that

he see the truth and
it

i be afraid this wine be making i
woozy

you have to








you have sought out the institution all
you life as you with it to replace you
father
this be obvious
obvious
be
institution not to
you but to







as this keep you father
truth be twofold and the truth be one



that every man be fallible that every
institution being
of man cannot
but be corrupt












the only art in
dish of course
be that it must be































that the institution cannot but be
corrupt and therefore it cannot be
but an act of
to seek to
it



so many civilization eat they slay
enemy
what do you think
how
much good to devour a person
physically than to devour he spirit
which be of course the purpose of the
institution



and that be the
surprise
i have prepared for you

i feel weak

you must eat










do not








the
but the
not need help
the
enemy
for you
sought to befriend to
wish the love of those who wished you i will



come
no nerve in the brain come






come
you























oh no
oh
they have put a beeper on
you
how careless of i
how finally
careless do you think
have i err on
purpose
eh
or be i just unlucky
could one not say that be the essential
question of philosophy


might i have some more of the wine



because i find i like the effect
you
may say that it be inebriation but it
seem
this lovely evening in particular
it
seem to reward i with






or perhaps it be just the
be just saying to the




but do you know do you know i be not
altogether



i have get she









may be the heat

let we get she
of here




but as i
used to say

ohmiGod






























that be why it be a
means do not come back







well

he
come back

baby that be the begin of wisdom


























give i you gun
