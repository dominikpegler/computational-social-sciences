when i be a little girl i mother
would remind i each night before
bed to be sure to open i heart to
god for he be kind merciful and
just
thing changed after i
father left a few year later
leaving she to raise i and i
brother alone in a little place
out on the edge of the mojave
desert
she never talk about a
kind and merciful god again
instead she speak of a prophecy
of a time when all the world would
be covered in darkness and the fate
of mankind would be decided
one
night i finally get up the courage
to ask i mother why god have
changed why be he mad at his
child

said tuck the cover around i
i guess he just get tire of all
the bullshit
