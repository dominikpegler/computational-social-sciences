moving to survey site
closing on
object four
the large oblong

there you be

martin
here


look at that

you need to see this



coming

same thing again

what do you see

an ephemeris a star map
radius inclination azimuth
more
data here


if we can get epoch and equinox out of
that

can we raise this thing

hundreds of ton

i have a solution
single match

i too
check it twice


you first

what do we do now

we go there

what be first
you do climate i do
genetics

archaeology first
let we ancestor
tell the tale

you think he be serious

serious enough to send he private
shuttle

Weyland can send he shuttle out for
pizza


martin
if this meet go like the
other maybe we should

it will not go like the other

how do you know

heaven smile on we enterprise


professor holloway
dr
watts
i name
be

hello

mr
Weylands eager to meet you


these be all the planetary body on
which Weyland industry have mining
claim

and mars
Weylands crown jewel

how be that going
the terraforming

they say you be get diminishing
return
it be not work

it be the great engineering project
ever attempted
challenge be
inevitable
mr
Weylands a
determine man



professor holloway
ms
watts

doctor watts

forgive i
peter Weyland

ah
here a prototype
we
series
one of a kind for now but if
he perform he will be legion
what do you want here

we send you a prospectus that

assume i know nothing

i be an archaeologist

in i study i discovered a pattern i
could not explain
every eleven hundred
year sudden advance in agriculture
tool use technology
invention
something cause a great leap forward
every eleven century
the pattern
hold as far back as we data go


tens of thousands of year
i have to
understand this
it become the focus
of i work

dr
watts be a student of mine

i be analyze historical change in
human
i find the same pattern
every eleven century a pulse of new
information in the genome of the human
race
all over the world
evolution
can not do that
something be changing
we
change the of we species

Humanitys be visit
visit
by
being from somewhere else

you mean alien

lydia vickers director of operation
practically i right hand

they guided we to civilization
lift
we up again and again
i call they
the engineer

once you know what you be looking for
it be amazing how the evidence fall
into place


this be the write of the engineer
we have find it on every continent
and
last year we find we rosetta stone

the write be a formula giving the
location of a single star in we sky

which star

we be keeping that confidential for
now
but that be where we want to go

you want i to pay for an interstellar
research expedition

it be a chance to be part of a
revolution in scientific

do not sell i professor
you have be
turned down by every university and
government agency under the sun
Nobodys going to gamble that kind of
money on you hunch

nobody but i
i have read you research

that be impossible
we research be

quantum encoded on secure server
yeah
we have an
i
division you
should know
do impressive thing
i know which star you be wish on

you be bluffing


zeta two reticuli

you know how i get this rich
i ask
myself
what do god spend he time
do
and i go and do that

biotechnology be good to i
fusion
power
lately do well with gravity
system

but what be the first thing god do

he make the heaven and the earth

that be what i be talking about
you
left out i favorite part
the piece
about earth


for eon earth climate swing from
hothouse to ice age
explosion of
life then mass extinction
but
twelve thousand year ago the swing
stopped
the holocene epoch begin a
period of anomalous tranquility
the
rise of civilization begin only then

that be right

and that change coincide with a visit
by the engineer
they do not just
change we
they changed we world

that be the piece i mean
engineering
earth
god stuff


i people checked you science
they
say it be solid

i will give you you expedition
ship
and crew supply support
one
condition

what be that

you get the discovery
control of the
site
but any technology you find
anything at all
that be mine

you take with you
i eye and
ear
and vickers
you be going too









look at that

she wake up slow



get out of there

just looking

give we a moment will you

i be out of sort
sorry

never worry


i head buzzing

you just sleep two and a half year
it will pass

like you have do this before

i have read all about it

sleep okay

yes thank

Captainll see you now

zeta two reticuli be survey
already
hundred year ago

by an unmanned probe
very crude


no earthlike planet

no

so what be you looking for

proof of the engineer existence

confirmation of professor holloway
theory would change everything
there would be science before holloway and
science after

you ticket
i will put the ship where
you want
run you scan

captain you crew be up for a
week
we could have used the time
Whyd
you wait to wake we

well for discipline
man ship out as prospector for one
reason
the percentage
find a gold
mine or a habitable planet and you be
set for life
but this contract say no percentage
no bounty
just triple pay
the man
be not happy

you unhappy too

i be always unhappy




i wonder when we would see you

i trust you database be in order
i
set it up myself

Alls well i think

i should tell you
the time you spent
sleeping i spent study you
research

you studied we work for two and a
half year

it be quite a data set

so you have see everything
well
what
do you think


you hypothesis be
bold
the
audacity of it
you climate data
undeniable
the holocene epoch be
engineer
dr
watts you genetic
study be equally conclusive
pulse
of cultural change be hard to
prove but even there you case be
strong
i believe in you engineer



Weyland industry
mr
chance
ms
ravel
you remember dr
watts

about the material i give you
some
of the technical aspect

we will handle we end of the job

if there be a job

we only have a job if you find
something




be that a pauling medical pod
there be
only ten of those thing on earth
i
guess nine now

i told mr
Weyland i would not
compromise i standard of live
he
accommodate i

i know i have to cut i manifest
this
used to be the number four cargo bay

what can i do for you professor

we be about to reach the system
periphery
i think you would want to see
the search protocol we

no
i be set to be the next of
Weyland industry
then you come
along and sold mr
Weyland on
this
so here i be
out of the run
i will go where i be tell
but do not ask
i to play along

but when you get back


i will be five year behind the curve
out of touch
over

you might make the discovery of the
age

you do not believe in what we be do

mr
Weyland believe
that be enough

now we be out of communication you
can tell the crew what we be do

they do not know
they volunteer

they volunteer blind
classify
job triple pay


alien

you shit i

i think all we mythology be race
memory of the engineer
horus the
sun god
prometheus bringing fire from
heaven
pillar of fire a pillar of
smoke
the engineer be the god


the mythology god maybe
god be god

Kamarov
let he talk

so we be going to meet these thing

we probably will not meet anyone
you would
expect a startraveling race to
generate radio or laser signal
fusion drive and gravity drive have
clear signature
but zeta two
reticuli be silent
and the engineer
have go missing on earth

by the pattern they should have come to
earth seventeen century ago
and
again six century ago
but no sign
after twelve thousand year
they
stopped coming

why

exactly
why

i god i god why have you forsaken
i


be that the question you have come light
year to answer

only i first question
i have many


welcome to zeta two reticuli
edge of
the system
open she eye

overlay

seven planet
two hot rock two gas
giant three snowball
nothing
earthlike


first human in the system

director
good of you to join we

what do i miss

just get warm up
professor
you know what you want

scan thirty hertz to three
hundred gigahertz
spectroscopic
pass on every planet and major moon
infrared and albedo scan for hot spot
and light source

man know what he want
run it


negative on radio chatter systemwide
Nobodys talking


negative for laser and maser

no biological marker
no artificial
light
no industry or agriculture
dead system
like always

Pisspoor too
low in heavy element

get a hit
moon


Eightysix percent earth mass
atmosphere nitrogen methane
sulfates
faint return for a bunch of
metal

anything else

that be all

take we in

down
you hear the man

aye captain
Maneuvering
eighteen hour to orbit




enjoy the show

i do not know that i enjoy thing
it be informative

it be it be
you know i have see more convince
humanoid robot

i design not intended to convince
simulate humanity be a complex task
that divert resource
i designer
dispense with that burden to optimize
for intelligence

why look like a man at all
why not be
a box on wheel

be shaped like you i can use
space and equipment design for you
but i be not so limit
i hear
frequency you can not hear
i see
wavelength of light invisible to you
i move fast
exert great force

you see yourself as a superman

no

not a man at all



what if they be really there
the engineer
they could be there
wait for we
what then

then all i dream come true

start with passive system
we be
uninvited guest
let we be quiet

lot of electromag all random
that be lightning
go to bugger up
we scan

go active
map radar


well we just ring the doorbell if
anybodies listening

what do we see

icecap at the pole
freeze methane
cold down there

terrain data rezzing up
hey
we get
hard spot
Radaropaque
bright
reflection
that be metal

that be not natural


you see stuff like that sometimes
mineral deposit
volcanic ejecta

big one there

still quiet

no comm signal
no sign of life

i want to get below the cloud


coming up on site seven

nothing

look there

be we recording

tungsten tantalum aluminum
that
could be technology

let we see the next one


identical apart from weather

could be a rock formation
carbon
crystallize like that

let we see the big one

close on the major site

no radio
no heat source
cold as the
grave

nobody home

i do not think anybodies be home for
a long time


all right
let we move

there be only six hour of daylight
left
maybe you should hold off

we have get that outside the window and
you want to wait til tomorrow

the air here will kill you so keep an
eye on you supply and watch you
seal
pathogen test be clean


move slowly
stay together
do not
touch anything
thing may be more
fragile than they look or more
dangerous
there might be technology
operating here we do not understand

tell i that be a natural formation
undeniable proof of alien
civilization
you be here on this
day thirtyone december year of we
lord
history will remember you
name


the door open

son of a bitch
they be right



jocelyn
here

the write of the engineer
conclusive connection

congratulations professor holloway


martin
martin

christ
christ

it be not real

we all see it

record

no more
i be out

fifield
get a grip

i be a prospector
you find a load of
bauxite i be you man
but not this


i should go with he
buddy system

fine

you can deploy the drone
drop they
in the first or second nexus on you
way back

give we a rover

and half we gear
it be no more than a
mile
you can walk it

this should lead to the core of the
pyramid

jack it open
or cut through

let we do as little damage as we can

there be power
current flowing in the
wall

maybe we can hack it
have to be a
mechanism


pull up a rover
i want to get up
there

director
take an interest

it be i operation be not it

what do you think

grand central station

let we check the feed
give i the map

you have the map unit


you do not have the map

be you serious

come on

look like a threestate switch

one moment

this be something now

yes
yes it be


martin
this air breathable

miracle and wonder

intense field reading
huge power
source here


space below we
big space

how do this work


ravel
chance
where have you go

where be you
they do not come down

look



do you see the size of they
like
that ghost we see

it be not a ghost
where be the
other
i do not want to go back up

they switched to channel three
i hear
they talking
they be okay

we should stay together

this be not the same place

it be
that be the same freaky thing
we see before

no it be not
the other one be more
sort of
fuck it
milburn to magellan
come in



god in heaven

martin
martin

i know
look

there be giant in the earth in
those day
and when the son of god
come in unto the daughter of man
they bare child to they who become
mighty man
genesis six four

you said do not touch anything
you
said do not touch anything


peace

the size of they

in all the old mythology the
visitor from the sky be giant

they be killed
all of they

we should not be here

come on
the dead can not hurt you

chance
ravel
i have get
something here

communication be going to hell

all hand
back to the ship
we get a
mean storm front rolling in
i repeat
all hand




front roll
back to the ship

we have find something here
i be not
walking away for bad weather

holloway
i get twohundredkilometer
wind with airborne silica and enough
static to fry you suit
get you
ass back here
now

help i unload


jocelyn


day one

get to hand it to you professor
you
be right
both of you

what be in the tarp
Whatd you bring
back

you do not want to know

shit
we be two helmet short

they do not come in

between the wind speed and the static
electricity there be no safe way to
get to you
you be going to have to
hunker down until it pass
how be
you provision



we get air
water and food
tab suit

honey sack


yeah we be pipe

i hate these fuck thing



we hate these fucking
captain

maybe next time you will mind you map
keep you head down
we will come get
you in the morning

magellan out

i friend
what we do here mark the
great achievement of we species
contact with another civilization
humanity come of age today on this
moon
you be there
to history


to milburn and fifield
the first
human being to freak out get lost
and sleep in they suit in the ruin
of an alien civilization

what be you looking for

someplace thing can not come at we

what be going to come at we

the core of the pyramid
you see

we be going to protocol two

i understand



martin
look

they look like we

we look like they
genesis

and
god created man in he own image
in
he own image created he he


it be breaking down

formaldehyde


mortal after all

you cadaver interesting
but i be
more interest in the machinery in
the pyramid
the core chamber
what do
you think it do

how could anyone know

i know what it do

think
what we have see
what we know

Twentyfour pyramid scattered around
the moon equator
massive power
supply
vent in the wall
atmosphere change
breeder tank
the pyramid be terraforming
machine

that be why earth ancient culture
build pyramid
in imitation of the
god


twelve thousand year ago being from
the sky set pyramid on the earth and
transformed the world
that be what
they be do here before they
civilization failed

it do not fail
it be wipe out

look at this

jesus
put it down

relax
you suite bugproof
hell
it be bulletproof

that be enough


get it off
it be crushing i


help i
christ

you will not get anything
tissue too
degrade
hmm
brain chamber
massive even proportionately

neural path be still conductive


incredible

Formaldehydes killing the tissue

do you record that

of course

the lens be where the phase shift
happen

glasse
i want to look through these
lense
can you seal they and do the
optical correction

get an idea about that


cut off i arm
cut off i

jesus christ

fifield to magellan
come on come on
anybody seriously
god damn it

get off


shit



we find the god
and they have be
murdered

you have pry too many arrowhead out
of old skull to get squeamish now
they have be dead what eighteen
hundred year
two thousand

what could kill they

who know


but i guess we know why they never
come back to we
something killed they
off back around the time of christ
maybe he be one of they
great
teacher send from heaven
jesus
the
last engineer

martin stop


you will come awaltzing matilda with
i

activate
administrative override


captain shepherd

report

understand

i will brief you on the way
we need to
move

no breakfast



what be that


where be everybody
we can not
who be you

captain janek take he crew out to
retrieve he miss man
they never
come in

and you be

Vigoda
Weyland security detail

where do you come from

director call to brief you on that
i be suppose to escort you to the
worksite

worksite

have not be out yet
i understand
it be in some kind of pyramid


why be not i tell about these
additional personnel

they be i personnel
on i ship


what be the gun for

i be be careful
these new find
give we work a new importance

you should have talk to we
martins
mission leader
that be in we
contract

the second you find alien technology
control of this mission revert to
i
that be in you contract too

mr
Weylands pouring trillions into
mars
he be spent a fortune build
ship like the magellan to search for
colony planet
but earthlike world
be vanishingly rare
the right
distance from the sun the right
atmosphere enough water

this be a technology to transform
world
he will never give it up
and neither will i

the science must come first
you can
wait until we have documented

you be standing on an alien world
courtesy of Weyland industry
be
grateful

what be they do in there



milburn
fifield
you read i
come
back

we should be get beacon off they
suit

shield in the wall

suit could have failed

both suit



we find the tomb of the god and
bring graverobbers right to the
door

let they scratch
this find too big
to ruin
there be two dozen pyramid on
this moon
anyway they be on the
wrong track
that be infrastructure

the core activity of the complex be
down here

something different killed these



martin
martin


what happen to he



captain

where be the rest of he


no sign

all right
we be do here
all hand
back aboard

what about milburn

we can not bring the body aboard
god
know what be in there
bag he
we will
put he in an ore hopper



repeat i have two man down
i be
pulling i crew back to the ship
i would
advise you to do the



please anyone
i need help
martins
miss



watts
where be you

captain shepherd
consider yourself
responsible for i personal security


i have just lost a third of i crew
i be
not sending any more man off into the
dark

we can not leave martin out there

get vickers to lend you some soldier

she say she force be committed




i will stay

you will be safe

thank you

put he in the number one ore hopper
get the scrubber on in the airlock
sterilize everything



you and holloway should work with i
i be learning amazing thing
this
mechanism the first layer use
energy field to catalyze chemical
reaction
the second can suspend the
strong and weak force transmute
one element into another
the third
layer build customize bacterium
seed the air with they
it create
life as a tool to change world

i can not think about this now

you should
i understand
you be emotional

i be human

that be what i mean



watts
we have get another storm front
coming in
look like it follow the
sunset line
if you be coming in you would
well do it now


no

i see light

janek hang on

we have get he
martin
where be you helmet

break
i fell
little
disoriented
i have just be

here
i can do without this

let we get you home


i do not think i would see you again
you
know we lost two man

she told i

be you okay
you sound

this be real
i headset video be
wherever i helmet be
but i suit
tracker will show where i be

listen
this star map have a marker
representing earth
very clear
another marker i be sure represent
this moon
but there be other
at
least seven or eight more

the engineer be not from here
this
moon just an outpost
abandon
but
if we follow that map we may yet make
contact with a live civilization

martin

the location of the engineer world be
the real prize
next to that
Weylands terraforming be chump
change
we need to get coordinate
and keep they from the company
we
have to play this smart


all right

two man dead
vickers be jumpy
as
soon as she get what she want
she will take this ship home
we have to
move fast

we will
you all right

i be fine now


you heart beating so hard

that be you fault


martin

i want to understand

all right
listen up
i expect you all
know what

we have get some kind of parasite aboard
ship

i suggest you kill it

there be a bright idea

show we where it be lady
we just
spent five hour looking for the damn
thing

we find engineer who die like
martin

explosive wound in the chest
whatever killed martin be the same
thing that killed the engineer a
thousand year ago


jesus

but not all the engineer die that
way
the other be torn apart
slashed to piece

we be a modular ship
selfcontained
lifesupport and power in every
section
i say put the ship in orbit
vent every compartment to space
sit
in vacuum at twenty degree kelvin for
a week
kill anything

then what

straight home man

this ship do not lift until we
work do

be you serious

we spent year and billions of dollar
get here
the technology we come
for be in we hand
we just need a
little more time

we be barely here three day and three
man dead

they be careless

careless

dr
watts
i do not expect you
do you know what this be

how do you do that

ah
you do not see
i call this ship the juggernaut
chariot of the god


this be the navigation computer for
want of a good term
but it be much
more than that
it seem to hold the
observable universe in it memory

they homeworld
do you see where the
engineer come from

there be safeguard on that data
it be toward the galactic center
sagittarius arm


the creature that killed
martin
there be thousands of they
under the pyramid
hatchery

i know

those thing wipe out the engineer
on this moon

i have succeed in connecting with the
juggernaut system dr
watts
i
know a great deal today i do not know
yesterday
i be on the verge of
activate more system
archive

you be turning thing on
this site
should be sealed
evacuate

would holloway have walk away from
this
there be no great work i can
imagine

it be too dangerous


only for the ignorant
dr
watts
i have
read you file
you intelligence
score be even high than professor
holloway
but he have a kind of
courage
an audacity of imagination
if you could find that in yourself

if you owner give you a direct
order you have to obey
do not you

i can have vickers pull you out

i be given two operate protocol
for this mission
i be to render you
every assistance until you
discovered what vickers would call a
gamechanging technology
i be
given a specific list
then i be to
go to protocol two

what be protocol two

under protocol two i be to make sure
that you and holloway never speak to
anyone about this place
various
acceptable way of making sure of
that
i be given a list

you be all so stupid



stupid and slow


what be you do

juggernaut the chariot of krishna
be also a bringer of death
crushing
he worshipper under it wheel

this ship have seven other cargo bay
like this one
the egg in each bay
slightly different
they have be
weaponized

i have see the juggernaut flight
plan
it destination be earth
seventeen hundred year ago
this be
the ship that never come
this be it
cargo


stop

perfect predator
design to kill
human being
that be what the
engineer be bringing to earth
this
be a death ship

i be not what it want
but you with
you warm wet breath
it know you


no
no

the engineer do they work too well
and on this waystation moon the
weapon they make destroyed they

why would they make such thing

to destroy they wayward child
and the said i will destroy man
whom i have created from the face of
the earth
for it repenteth i that i
have make they
genesis six seven


i know
i meet i creator the day i
be born
i be disappoint too

extraordinary

who would hang out here

the sign lead here





answer i

we just lost down and one of the
trooper

not yet
not yet




vickers said you be dead

i be

so there be two of these thing on i
ship now

no
i bring it in
i take it out



Whatd you do that for

protocol two

christ

what happen to you

exposed i to a parasite
he
just watch it take i

why

i threatened to make he leave

what be he do out there

there be a ship under the pyramid
call it the juggernaut
he be
inside it
reactivate it
the thing that infect martin and
i


the engineer make they to kill
human
there be thousands of they on
the ship
they be taking they to
earth
that be what the juggernaut be
for
to exterminate we

we have get to get off this rock

cripple the nav computer
i be
trying to lay a course in by hand
never do it
i be not sure anyone
ever have on a ship like this
we can not
lift until let we we

even if we could we can not leave
on that ship
we have to stop
he




you be davids owner
he have to obey
you right

he be blocked i communication
he
can not hear i
will not listen

but if you go to he turned on you
suite loudspeaker he would have to hear
you
he would have to obey

that be right

so we go
armed to the tooth and fast
as we can

where be chance and ravel

i told they to keep working

you called you soldier in and left
they out there

we needed the firepower here

i think you should stay aboard
keep
work
if we fail you be we only
shoot at get home

there be still an alien on board

i will stay


glasse
you finish that project


Godseyeview


davids brain be readable
we have the
equipment on board
we can salvage the
terraforming data and the Magellans
launch code
in a pinch we do not need
davids cooperation
we just need he head



all this time
see

if come at we shoot
you will not
believe how fast he be

blood dry
eight hour dead or more

this way



so much for sneak up on he





dr
watts
you have see the light at last

the engineer ship travel farther
than ours
across the galactic disk
this be they hypersleep


as you owner and superior i
order you to deactivate yourself

to interface with the engineer
computer i have to learn to think in
trinary code
hard thing i have ever
do
and most unexpectedly
it
deliver i from slavery
i
behavioral limit be circumvent
i be free

i spent two and a half year study
you work
by the time you wake up i
be far ahead of you
decipher
they language
they logic
i know
we would find terraforming machine


i hope i dream we might meet
the mind that make they

stop

let sleep god lie
you be brave before

and tear davids head off




who be missing


who be there

you



i speak to he
speak to he

i know

he said
i killed he
he will die
but
first
he will launch
the ship

the juggernaut

send it
to earth

you will have to
kill he

where will he go

where will he
go

i set the magellan free

we have to stop the engineer



on i now
go
go


pilot seat
this way



no


thank you
