these
thing be not quite that simple

this do not look good

see this
solis have i driving the
shitmobile and he picked this up
straight out of impound for fourteen
grand
probably worth thirty

police corruption
it be everywhere

this will take time to setup
i will
have to get authorization
okay you relax and i will

what do we get

minute ago the silent alarm go
off then the fire alarm
unit be
a block away and the suspect get
trapped inside

any verification on number

we have only see and talk to one
suspect
he call himself joe
there be two jewelers two salespeople
the manager a security guard and
an elderly woman
this particular
store be where they do a lot of
jewelry make and repair
they have
anywhere from to million in raw
stone on any give day so they
sure as shit do not just wander in
they know what they be coming for

what have you promise they

just that i would talk to i superior

any good point of entry

the place be design to be a vault

i name roper
how be you people
do in there
solis be off the job now joe
i be
the guy authorized to give you
whatever you want
that be right but first i need to
come down there to talk to you

you do not have to come here

yes i do
that way there be no
misunderstanding
i need to make
sure no one hurt then we can take
care of business



alright roper
you want to come
come

good
i will not be armed
we get to
operate on trust here
we be going
to wrap this up and have you guy
out of here as soon as possible

stay there

i be going to put i hand down okay

be you in charge roper

yep

i want a car
like a four wheel drive
i want it in perfect condition
i
want a uniformed cop to drive it up
right here
i want he to leave the
engine run and walk to the end
of the street
then we will come out
i do not want any remote control
device in it
i know all the trick
if it be not in perfect condition
and i mean if it even low on wiper
fluid i be going to kill somebody
and we be going to start again

i want a plane waiting at the airport
i will tell they where i want to go
when i get there

be that all

for now that be all

you will get it
but joe i want you
to do something for i
let i take
a look around inside
make sure
everybody okay

no
you just do shit for i right
now

joe i be do a lot for you
i think
you could give i something to cement
the deal
one hostage

i will give you something

in fifteen minute it will be a big
piece
i assume there be no
misunderstand

i understand you completely

we be going to have to take this guy
out

can not we wear he down

i believe there be at least one
fatality in there already
the fire
alarm be probably set off by gunfire
i believe he be working alone both
from he conversation and the fact
that he would not come out beyond the
doorway
he be holding a gun on the
hostage while he be talking to i
he demeanor be calm and control
that be what really scare i
the
other bad news be that he also
indicate a familiarity with we
technique
so do you want to go in or wait for
he to come out

let he come out
too many unknown
in there

when we drive up the car make sure
it be at an angle about three foot
from the curb
put we good man highground twenty
degree down angle

have anderson prep it and notify we
when he be on line

i feel this thing going sideways on
we

there be some good news
he be wearing
a ski mask so he be protecting his
identity and have not determined to
kill all the hostage
yet

drag they behind the counter

i be not staying here another minute
