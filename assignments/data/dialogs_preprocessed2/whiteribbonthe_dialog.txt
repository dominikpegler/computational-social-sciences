have trip over a hardly visible taut wire
that have be strung between two tree
the doctor fourteenyear old daughter have
watch the accident from the window of the
house and be able to inform the woman who be
they neighbor who in turn get the message to
the manor house so that the agonize doctor
could be transport to the hospital of the
district capital that be over kilometer
away


the neighbor a single woman of
around be the village midwife who have
filled the invaluable position of housekeeper
and receptionist for the doctor since the death
of he wife in childbirth

have go to the school to fetch she own son
hans

be you now grow up enough to live on you own
be you
do you want to leave home and start a
life of you own
so you can come and go as you

in the meantime i will go round up the man


the steward child said they have
see Sigi only for a short time that he have
go off with other kid and that they do not
pay much attention to it


the search begin shortly after
midnight
before the baron have ride to the
rectory
but there he find out nothing new from
the child who have be specially wake up
the searcher who be tire and some of whom
be still drink be divided into two group
one group start to search all the building on
the estate one by one while the other comb
the surround area
it be around half past two when some member
of the search party have already preferred to lie
down somewhere and to sleep off they
drunkenness that the siren suddenly sound
again calling the man back to the courtyard
they have find Sigi
he have be tied up in
the old sawmill upside down
he trousers have
be pull down and he buttock be bleed
from cane stroke
he seem to be in a state of
shock be unable to walk and have to be bring
back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher
lying on he belly


the next sunday the baron at the end
of the service ask the pastor if he could say
a few word

you all know now what be do to i son
siegmund
policeman from the district town be
here this week
they question many of you
but
to no avail
first i think that the people who
torture i child be the same people who cut
off i family cabbage head
because they wanted to get even
get even
for what
because they mother have die while
she be working in the sawmill and it be
supposedly i fault which be an absurd
assertion
at least that be what franz felder give as the
motive for he mowing prowess when the
policeman arrest he
i have always supported
the farmer felder and he family but one can not
always expect people to be grateful
that be a
matter of character

do not run away felder
it be you honor i
want to salvage
it have turn out that the valiant franz felder
have be boasting of he feat in front of he
fiancee
then the coward that he be hide among
he family and so he do not have time to
torture i son
and there be one thing i know for
sure
the senior felder would rather bite off
he tongue than cover for he wayward son
may
i remind you something what most of you have
already forgotten
almost two month ago the
doctor have a riding accident and he have still
not return from the hospital
this accident
be cause by a wire that have be strung in his
garden with the explicit intent of bringing he
down
and in that case too nobody know
anything see anything or hear anything

we all know that the people responsible for the
terrible injury suffer by i son and those
suffer by the doctor be sitting here among
we in this room
i will not tolerate that crime
of this nature go unpunished
i do not wish
something similar to happen to any of you
child
that be why i call upon you all to help
i find the culprit or the culprit
ask
question keep you ear open be watchful
if
we fail to find out the truth the peace within
we community will be go
thank you pastor

the landowner speech frighten the
people
most know about the incident at the
thanksgiving feast
but the majority do not know
exactly what have happen and in the end they
do not care
the baron be not really popular
among the people but he be respected as a
powerful social figure as well as the employer
of nearly the whole village


he threat about loose the peace
of the community could not mean anything good
at the same time the mysterious character of
what be obviously criminal deed feed the
mistrust of the farmer deeply rooted since
time immemorial

come in

the villager take that as a sign
of he anger
indeed no evidence have be find
as to the possible author of the crime although
the baron appeal have lead to a flood of mutual
suspicion even to some attempt of
denunciation that have all turn out to be
untenable

it have always disgusted
i
i accepted it because i wanted to ease i
pain after Erikas death and i do not care with
whom
i could have screw a cow
whore be
unfortunately too far from here and regrettably
once every two month be not enough for i even
though i be get old
so skip you damn
martyrdom routine and get out

why do this
only occur to you now

accord to you
when should it have
occur to i
at the hospital i have forgotten how tiresome
you be
one grow sentimental when one in

there be no room for any
with you

that would surprise i
but be careful
it might
be painful

i know
i be ridiculous
you would not
care anyway

well


why do you despise i
for helping to
raise the boy
for watch you finger you
little daughter and not saying a word
for helping you to deceive yourself
for
listening to you claim how unique you love for
erika be though the whole village know how
badly you treated she
for loving you although i know you can not stand
be loved

that be it
now leave i alone
i have get
work to do

you can not afford to get rid of i
who
would do the dirty work for you who would help
you with the child and here in you practice
you be not speaking seriously
you just want to
see how far you can go do not you
will she
still put up with it or can i drag she even
lower through the mud
i be tire too
i have get two retard child
hans and you
you be the one that give i most
trouble

i god why do not you just die


the year be coming to an end with
fine weather
the sun make the snowy landscape
sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eye
none of we suspected that it would be the last
time a year moved on to the next in an era of
peace and that that same year a radical change
would take place of which no one have the
faint inkling


despite of the strange event that
have unsettled the village we think of
ourselves as united in the belief that the life
in we community be god will and worth
live


i take of this ribbon from you in
the belief that from now on you will no longer
need it
you marie will be accepted this year as a full
member of the church community
you will receive

christs body as bread and as wine
may the time
of preparation for the confirmation feast be one
of happiness and enrichment
and you martin
from now on you shall not only
be free of that ribbon but also from those
nightly tie that be intended to save you from
yielding to the temptation of you young body
for in a house full of festive expectation you
too on you own shall make you contribution
to mental and physical purity
i trust in you i beloved child and wish
you a profitable and happy new year

shortly after easter in the last week
of april the baroness come back with the
child
she be accompany by a new nurse
thus i secret hope that eva would be able to
come back here have definitely be dashed
the nurse be a chubby middleage italian who
come as everybody soon learned from the town
on the mediterranean coast where the baroness
have spent the winter

Sigi

hi ferdinand

wait
i be coming down


stay here Sigi you can see he
later

let he go signora
he be so
happy to be home again

all right you
can go
but do not stay too long

beatrix
beatrix where be
you

Sigi
do not you want
to come say hello to you father

watch out he be coming

be quiet
for god sake
be quiet


what be going on here
why be you
still here
you know that there be a confirmation
class now
get out
how about saying goodbye
goodbye sir
goodbye pastor

i be sorry pastor
it will not
happen again
goodbye pastor

goodbye
let we pray
sit down

this be a very sad day for i
in a few week we all want to celebrate the
confirmation feast together
for many month i have tried to bring god word
closer to you and to make responsible human
being out of you in he spirit
and what do i face today
horde of yell
monkey without any discipline or human
dignity as childish as the sevenyear old
with whom you be sharing this classroom
but what make i even sad be the fact that
i own daughter be playing the lead role in
this pitiful display
last year i bound a white ribbon in she hair
well you all know that white be the color of
innocence
the ribbon be mean to help marie to
avoid sin selfishness envy indecency lie
and sloth
well at the start of the year i be naive
enough to believe that now in the year of she
confirmation she would become mature enough and
that she would not need that ribbon any more
i believe that she feel responsible be the
daughter of the spiritual leader of a christian
communi

Xeni

we have arranged to meet at the town
railway station since eva wanted to avoid being
see with i
she be living with distant
relative who be apparently reporting
regularly to Evas parent about she lifestyle
she have become thin which make she even
pretty and once again i be ravish by she
mixture of shyness and almost childlike
outspokenness



you want you
hair part r to the right or to the left
how
about one part to the left and one to the
right
all the people in the saloon be laughing they
head off

Murer who be so
distinguished that he never crack a smile have
to laugh

then it be not really so awful
be it

no
but sweeping up hair all day honestly
the twin be more fun i must say
but it be all right

hansi
where be you
give we a sign
hansi where be you

over here
he be here

i




after this intricate atrocity
committed on the retard boy even the baron
be finally convince that it would be more
intelligent to call upon the professional help
of the county police force
so a few day later a couple of plainclothe
policeman arrive and after a visit to the
several of the crime scene start to ask in
various home if anyone have notice anything
suspicious

after learn of Hansis torture i
do not think at first of what liesl have tell i
when it come back to i mind i at first
hesitate to tell the authority about it
because of such an absurd coincidence i do not
want to jeopardize the reputation and inner
peace of the steward family
but when i hear that hansi might loose his
eyesight because of he injury one afternoon
i make liesl come to school and tell the police
officer about she dream


thank god we be not as
stupid as you might think


but i only dream it

now listen carefully
i will
give you a last chance
you tell i who told
you about the plan to torture the boy and we
will not tell anybody who told we
all right

she be already dream of
something that have come true

be that so
and
what be it if i may ask
wanting to spare she talk
about it
something that happen in she
family

i see
something to do with she family
and have you
check if it be true

no

well all
that may be true
maybe we be really dealing
here with an authentic clairvoyant and we do not
realize how lucky we be
maybe we only need to
ask she who be behind all this
the we send she
to bed she dream a bit and tomorrow she tell
we who do it
how about that
Everythings
possible be not it
stop crying
you deceitful whining will not work with i
i have
get other way to make you talk
i do not believe
in witch and magician let alone that a
chubby little girl like you have supernatural
hallucination
therefore you would well get used
to the idea of telling the truth because you
will not bet rid of i until you have come clean
be
that clear
all right and now we be going to visit you
parent to see what they think of you version
of the story

but i can not
stand this place any longer
not so much for i
personally though i can not say that life with
you be exactly thril for a woman of i age

want Sigi and later the twin to grow up in
surroundings dominated by malice envy apathy
and brutality

i be sick and tire of
persecution threat and perverse act of
revenge

town and see she

when i go to the estate on friday

it with i to the school and get going early
as the trip be a quite long one i witness a
strange confrontation


completely mad

he will throw you out on you ear
slander other people and create trouble
that be all we need now
get out and never come back again
this be
unbelievable

good evening sir

good evening marie

good evening sir

what be you do here

we wanted to see how hansi be do

but can not you see that the
shutter be closed


yes
we be worry
we see mrs
wagner
riding off on a bicycle
so we wonder what have
happen to hansi

go home now
nobody said you
could come in here

you well go back home now
hurry

good evening teacher

good evening

then i think of Liesls dream again
what if liesl have not dream but have known that
hansi be going to be torture
whose crime do
she know of
whose name have she refuse to
reveal
the strong interest of the child in hansi
seem strange to i consider that they have
usually refuse to have any contact with he
because of he disability or only deal with
he in a rather disdainful manner
suddenly i wonder why the midwife have closed
the shutter of the house
nobody in the village
ever shut they house
why have the midwife
locked she boy in

hansi
can you hear i
hansi


if the midwife could not take care of
he she would have entrust the boy to i or
to the doctor
but since the night he be
mistreat i have not see he again
i decided to ask the doctor directly
the doctor practice be closed
until far notice

he daughter
be not she with you
at you school

yes she be

and she do not say anything

i have a request

yes

could i ask marie and martin

do not you want to wait for i
husband
he be at the church
the service will be
over in a quarter of an hour
but if you insist
please come in
please be seated
please
i will fetch the kid
for you

and
good evening sir

good evening

do not you want to sit down

yes
perhaps
with pleasure

can i offer you something

cup of coffee
like during
the piano lesson

yes with pleasure
that be very
kind of you

i will be back in a minute

do you know that the doctor be
leaving Eichwald

no

but you do not seem surprise at
i question

we mother told we when she come to fetch
we

and xenia do not tell you
anything about it

no

no

not a word
it be
very unusual for a child not to tell his
classmate before going away on a trip

xenia never talk much
about home

well that be something completely
different


i get the feel you be hide
something from i

what

that be what i would really like to
know

when you be looking for hansi a
while ago what do you want from he

we be worry
he be i will

i be asking martin

yes
he be not well
and since he mother
be go
we think we should go and pay he
a visit

do you ever ask yourselves who
could have treated hansi that way
and Sigi
and who tied the wire in the doctor garden
and who set fire to the barn
well

yes of course we wonder

well

we discuss it with father
he said it
must be a sick person

Sigi be with you at
thanksgiving
and so be hansi

i do not understand

what do they do to you

who


Sigi and hansi

why

they obviously be be
punished
for what

i do not know

liesl foresee that hansi would be
punished
what for

i do not know
why do you ask we

you be an intelligent girl
marie
do not try and play dumb

i do not understand you sir
you should
talk with father about this or with mother
shall i go get she

martin would you please get she

stay here martin
i will talk to
you parent when i consider it be the right
time
now i be talking to you
and i expect you

where be you on the evening hansi be find

at home

i mean after the confirmation

there we be
the coffee will be
ready in a minute
be the child able to help you

i be afraid not
they do not know
anything either

that be really odd
doctor can not
vanish into thin air
what about he patient

do not he daughter tell you
anything at school

no
i be sorry if i disturbed you

why do not you stay
i husband
will be back any moment and the coffee be
almost ready

that be very kind of you but i be
really worry about the midwife son

and she do not say when she would be
back

i do not ask she
she caught i
off guard
she be completely panick

strange
wait a second
i think
that be i husband

good evening

good evening
the schoolteacher
have be anxiously waiting for you

yes

yes
i would like to have a quick
chat with you

please
we would well go to i study
it be
quiet there

well how can i help you

i speak to the midwife today
she
said she now know who torture she son
who

she do


she will only tell the police
that be why she go to town
do not quite understand what the
schoolteacher be get at
well

she left the boy behind alone and
have locked the whole house

lock it

i go to the doctor
next door to ask he what be going on whether
he be taking care of the child or
but
there be a piece of paper saying that the
practice be closed until far notice
the
doctor and he child have disappeared

what do you mean

i do not know
i think
you might have be informed
that be why i be
here

i have no idea

xenia
be not he daughter in school

yes she be
she never mention
anything

i ask marie and martin
they
both know nothing either
look up to the schoolteacher
stun
why should they

i do not know
when i go to the
midwife place they be there with a few
other in the garden

to do what

they be looking for the boy

why

they wanted to help he

so what


i do not
know how to say it
i have the feel they be
hide something

what
keep on searching hesitantly for
he word
i do not know
finally he dare to
come out with he suspicion
when the doctor
have he accident
last year you remember
suddenly the child be in he garden
supposedly in order to help xenia

yes
and

nothing
i have forgotten it
today it come back to i mind again

i do not understand

when they find the baron
son
the last time he have be see he be
with the child

what be you get at

couple of day before hansi be
almost beaten to death the steward daughter
have predict precisely that to i
supposedly
she have dream it
the police think she be
lying
who told she about it
who announce it
to she

if i understand you correctly you be
saying that you pupil i child included
committed these crime
be that right
do you realize what you be saying
do you know

i assume that i be the first person to whom
you have utter this monstrosity
if you ever dare to bother other people with it
if you publicly denounce respectable family
and they child in this abject way i shall
make sure and you can take i word for it
that you will go to prison
i have see quite a lot during i work as a
pastor but i have never come across anything as
repulsive as this
one can tell that you have no child
otherwise you would not stoop to such
viciousness
you have a sick mind
i wonder how
the school authority could let you loose among
those poor creature
i will have a word with the
authority at the proper time
and now please leave i house
i never want to
see you here again

the midwife never come back
i wait
until the morning two day later
then i go
to the manor house to inform the baron
he
refer i to the steward and said to open the
house immediately and to look after the disable
boy


i have never come to the midwife
house and feel uncomfortable at the idea of
barge into somebody else house without
asking
it be strange but we be still
seeking and calling out anxiously Hansis name
and i already know that we be searching in
vain
anyone who know the midwife also know how
devoted she be to she disable child and that
she would never have left she wound hansi all
alone

during the next few week the village
gossipfactory worked overtime
some claimed the doctor be Hansis father
he
and the midwife have tried to abort the child so
that the shame of they relationship would not be
find out and that be how the child become
disable
other even go as far as to claim
that there be something fishy about the death
of the doctor wife and that they would not be
surprise if the two be not responsible for
it

whoever have lynch the boy obviously
know about the hide crime of he parent

suddenly it seem even possible that the doctor
and the midwife as potential murderer be
also the perpetrator of all the other crime
it be suspected that the doctor have wanted to
spare he legitimate child and himself public
disclosure of he guilt and have therefore flee
with they
apparently he have taken the disable
boy with he out of guilt
understandably
enough he have left behind he accomplice and
the mother of the disgraced child
the fact that it be on a bicycle that she tried
to catch up with the man who have happily
escaped be the because of a great deal of
laughter
on july th austria declared war on serbia
it
be follow on saturday august rst by the
german declaration of war on russia and on
france the follow monday



on the sunday between those date the
whole village come to the festive service
an atmosphere of expectation and departure be
in the air
from now on nothing would be the
same
only a few day ago everybody would have called
the life they live as god will worthy of
be live and would have shun any change
the strange joy with which the come war be
greet show that this certainty of order and
security be base on very shaky foundation

in the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that be
flaring up the event that have shaken Eichwald
have become an irrelevant
in the face of the come war Evas father have
taken he daughter back and at she plead
have come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place
where he future soninlaw be living and
work
the prospect that i might soon call
this beloved creature i wife turned this day
also into a solemn day for i
the pastor never mention we conversation
again
we relationship be limited to what be
required professionally
he apparently never
go through with he threat to denounce i to
the schoolauthorities
today more than a quarter of a century later
toward the end of i life and several year
after the end of a second war that be to change
this world in a more cruel and radical way than
the first one the one we faced at the time i
wonder if the event of those day and we
silence about they be not the germ of the
tragedy toward which we be heading
do not we all know secretly what have happen in
we midst
have not we in a way make it possible
by closing we eye
do not we keep we mouth
shut because otherwise we would have have to
wonder if the misdeed of these child of we
child be not actually the result of what
we would be teaching they
i be drafted at the start of the third year of
the war
after the war i sold the house in
Grundbach that i have inherit from i father
who have die in the meantime and with the money
i opened a tailor shop in the town where i
still live now
i never see anybody from the village again
