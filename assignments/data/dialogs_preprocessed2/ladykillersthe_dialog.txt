Goldthwait higginson
dorr ph

fudd

recognition of i mastery of the
antique language of latin and greek
i also hold a number of other advance
degree including the baccalaureate
from a school in paris france called
the sorbonne


sore bone well i guess that be
appropriate
you ever study at bob
jones university

i have not have that privilege


it be a bible school only the fine
in the country
i send they five
dollar every month

that be very gener


i be on they mail list
i be an
angel

indeed


they list i name in the newsletter
every issue
i get the literature
here you want to examine it

perhaps when i head have recovered
from it
buffete
mrs
munson
be you at all curious as to why i
darkened you door as the expression
have it on this lovely cameliascented
morn


i be wonder til you let pickle
out
then in all the excitement

i quite understand
the fact be that
i see the sign on you window
advertising a room to let and it be
the only such sign among the house
of this charming charming street


yeah i get a room
i be lookin for
a quiet tenant
fifteen dollar a
week

i quite understand
madam you be
address a man who be quiet and
yet not quiet if i may offer a
riddle

perhaps you can show i the room
mrs
munson and allow i to explain


well you can see the room but i
do not like doubletalk

you see madam i be currently on
sabbatical from the institution where
i teach the university of
mississippi at Hattiesburg
i be
taking a year off to indulge i
passion i do not believe that be
too strong a word for the music
of the renaissance
i perform in
and have the honor of directing a
period instrument ensemble that
perform at renaissance fair and
other cultural forum

thooout central and southern
mississippi
we perform on the
instrument for which the music be
originally composed in the belief
that
that
why this be lovely


wait a minute
you get some kind of
band

the word band would be in this
context something of an anachronism
though we do play together hence
the word ensemble the nature of
the music be such that one would
hesitate to apply the epithet band
with it connotation of jangling
rhythm and earpopping amplification


so you do not play hippityhop i
left i wallet in el segundo song
with the title spell all funny

madam i shudder
i quake
the
revulsion i feel for modern popular
music and all other manifestation
of contemporary decay be i have no
doubt the equal of own
why we
play music that be composed to the
great glory of god
devotional
music
church music


gospel music

Wellinspired by the gospel
certainly
the vintage of course
be no more recent than the rococo


rococo huh
well i guess that would be
okay

but i certainly do not propose to
inflict we rehearsal on you
may i
enquire do you have a root cellar

yes yes yes this look promise


little dank be not it

oh indeed but that only improve
the acoustic

marvelous
these earthen wall
be ideal for baffling the high
register of the uh lute and uh
sackbutt
that be why so much music
of the cinquecento be play in
crypt and catacomb
yes this will
do nicely

this be perfect
this be more
than perfect
i can scarcely contain
i glee


you contain it okay

allow i to pay you a week in advance
allow i to pay you two week in
advance
allow i to pay you a month
in advance

thought of these charming apartment

igneous


professor this be rosalie Funthes
rosalie professor

dorr ph


oh i that be an awful lot of letter

well of course in i youth i be
simply known as Goldthwait

all right safety meet let we
listen up
general could you hand
i the prima cord and the compound
there
before we set the charge we will
run through we procedure

i have earplug for whoever want
they
just wedge they in you ear
now here we have not yet lump

now
prima cord
Gelatinite

time come we pack the hole in the
rock with the and insert two lead


and

charge come from a battery that
be inside this plung
ordinary
auto battery you can pick it up at
sears easy thing in the world

i remember i father telling i
and it be one of the few memory i
retain of the man from one of his
visit home and how i do cherish it
he said Goldthwait you be not
form as other little boy


mmmm


he a man of learnin



number two be selfeducated
he have no career as such though
the state recognized the breadth of
he readin by making he librarian
at the state nervous hospital in
meridian where he be a distinguish
inmate

this be the same procedure we will
be use when we collapse the tunnel
after enter the casino vault and
returning to the root cellar

this be for you own protection
so pay close attention
once these
material be combined only the
professional may handle they
that
mean i or the general
separately
they be harmlesscompletely inert
why you could light this stuff on
fire hit it with a hammer


what in the name of heaven be
that

i be
quite sure
that there be
no because for alarm

why i be not even absolutely
certain that i hear anything at
all


do not hear anything

well something perhaps but

nothing that need discompose we
be the sense i be trying to
convey

miz munson i will not have you
missing you musical recital
why
you go ahead now
miz Funthes you
as well i beg of you

i shall call the gas company or
the water company or whatever
subterranean utility be implicated
in this little
occurrence
i
shall see to the matter
as only a
highly educated classicist could

blood professor
oh i god
blood

why it be nothing to make a fuss
about
perfectly all right
happen
all the time

you get to go find it dipshit

no no
really i be perfectly all
right

perfectly all right
you just blow
you fuck finger off

sure but

well get back down there and find
it man
i be not pickin up you
goddamn finger

i gather there be a premature
detonation

they can sew that shit back on jack
like that guy he wife cut he dick
off
just sew that motherfucker
back on

of course
simple thing in the
world
microsurgery

see that motherfucker in a porno
thing still work

oh yes they have remarkable ability
in the uh


they use the house to practice
music a the rococo

Mmmmhm



get he

i propose that we get we fall
comrade to the hospital and the
general shall follow when he manage
to recover the severed digit

i do not know what all the fuss be
about





you catch pickle now

the house be perfectly in order but
we need medical attention for mr
pancake who during the disturbance
pinched he finger in a valve of the
sackbutt


you let the cat out

the general be even now exercise
every effort to retrieve you
mischievous little pet
please go
go and enjoy you concert and we
shall see you later in the evening
au revoir me dame



despite we little setback we find
ourselves on schedule to penetrate
the vault

here this afternoon have
successfully blasted that little ol
rock to piece during miz Munsons
choir practice

clark perhaps you can run we
through the game plan for what remains
of we tunnelin



of course
why it be childes play
now easy thing in the world
only a couple of foot separate we
from the vault

just the usual spadework until we
hit the masonry of the vault and
then we drill through

and will you be able to wield the
drill with you maim extremity

oh i should think so it be only one
finger
inhibit i in doing fine
work of course
i will always have to
live with that
ahem
maybe and
i be just think out loud here
maybe since as you say it will
present problem later

yes clark

well maybe and this be something
i have talk over with mountain girl
and she agree with i so it be not
just one persona opinion maybe i
should get a little extra compensation
for the accident

somewhat large share
why if
this be any other line of work i would
be get workman comp would not
i
might even have a pretty good
lawsuit

you going to sue yaself for blowin off
you finger

well that be simply asinine

yes but you see clark this be not
what you just called some other
line of work


but if it be

this be a criminal enterprise not
to put too fine a point on it
entailin all manner a risk not
involved in honest labor
governmental
regulation an civic safeguard
cannot be assumed to apply to
antisocial pursuit

yeah but he lost he finger

we do not give a shit
man can blow
he own dick off do not make no
nevermind to we
we do not get to pay
the man for going around blowin off
body part
Getcha head outcha ass
man

look you

i think that in this instance gawain
have a very excellent point
i

no extra share

well okay majority rule like i
say it be just a trial balloon
hand not so bad really i even get
some phantom feel

you pull on you prick you get phantom
feel
greedy motherfuck

now that that matter be settled let
we synchronize we watch before
gawain report to work
in
twenty
second
it will be twelvesixteen
exactly
fifteen

it will be twelvefifteen

gentleman to we few
we who have
shared each other company each
other care each other joy and
who now reap the fruit of we
communal effits shoulder to shoulder
from each accordin to he ability
so forth whatnot
we have have we
little diffences along the way it be
true but i like to think they have
only make we value one another the
more each coming to understand and
appreciate the other unique
quality potency and yes
foible
i suggest that we shall
look back upon this caper one day
one distant day grandchildren dandle
upon we knee and perhaps a tear
will form and we shall say well
with wit and grit and no small
amount of courage we accomplished
something on that day a feat of
derringdo an enterprise not ignoble
we merry band unbind by the
constraint of society and the
prejudice of the common ruck we
happy few
gentleman to we

to we

charge should have go off already

i do beg you pardon

the charge to collapse the tunnel
i
set it for eight minute

well that time and more have most
certainly elapse

i need not remind you of the
importance of obliterate any trace
of a connection between the vault
and this house
it be of the essence
of this plan that it should appear
that the money have simply vanished
without a trace
spirit away as
it be by ghost

of course
i understand

the conundrum of the undisturbed yet
empty vault the unsolvable riddle
of the seal yet violate sanctum
be of the utmost importance not only
to make we caper innelectually
satisfy
it be also exigent as a
matter of practical fact
i remind
you that if a tunnel be ever find
leading to this house this house
owner know all of you name

she certainly do

therefore to draw the unavoidable
conclusion someone shall have to
reenter the tunnel to reset that
charge

huh

Nnnnrungh

huh

what the

you just fart

Hehhehheh

giddy tear relieve of you former
concern

collector of indian arrowhead and
have find one simply lying on
you cellar floor a particularly
rare artifact of the natchez tribe

apparently hit a motherlode of natural
gas i myself become acutely aware
of the smell of rotten egg and
it be at just this unfortunate moment
that the general here violate one
of the cardinal rule of this house
and light himself a cigarette

so sorry

in order to pay for the procedure
that will correct the wander eye
of he commonlaw wife mountain
water who suffer from astygmia and
strabismus and a general curdle of
the vitreous jelly
mr
pancake
however be an ardent foe of the
federal reserve and be in fact one
of those eccentric about whom one
occasionally read hoard his
entire life saving either under the
proverbial mattress or as in mr
pancake case in a hefty bag that
be he constant companion

steel sack

desperate man madam
we
have tunneled into the nearby office
of the lady luck gamble emporium
and have relieve it of it treasure


lord have mercy

it be true that the lady luck be a
den of iniquity a painted harlot
lure people into sin and exciting
the vice of greed with she false
promise of easy winning

of the booty to a charitable
institution the general to a
placement service for southeast asian

itself that riparian Gomorra shall
suffer no harm
it have an insurance
company a financial behemoth that
will cheerfully replenish it deplete
vault
that be it function
and
the insurance company itself be make
up of tens and tens of thousands of
policyholder so that we have
do the calculation mrs
munson

so that at the end of the day at
the final reckon each policy
holder shall have contribute only
one penny one single solitary
cent to the satisfaction of this
claim


just one penny

think of it mrs
munson
one cent
from thousands upon thousands of
people so that bob jones university
can continue on it mission
why i
have no doubt that be the policy
holder aware of the existence of
that august institution why each
and every one of they would have
volunteer some token amount to the
furtherance of it aim


well that be prob true

yes madam sadly the criminal stain
be upon i soul but the benefit
shall accrue to any number of worthy
cause
as long that be as the
secret stay with we
and i surely
shall not be the one to divulge it

it
one penny

cat

Motherfuck

yes
unfortunately mrs
munson have
rather complicate the situation

i know how to discomplicate it
put
a cap in the old lady head
then
everything simple again

not easy to do
many reason
practical one
a quiet neighborhood
a sleepy town
reason of moral
repugnance
a harmless woman a deed
conceive and executed in cold blood
no gawain
would that it be simple

well fuck man
what we going to do
give the money back and go to church

i shudder
i quake

you sir be a buddhist
be there
not a middle way

must float like a leaf on the river
of life
and kill old lady

well
i suppose you be right
it
be the active nature of the crime
though that so horrify the
squeezing of the trigger the plunge
of the knife
but think a moment
look at the other tool we have at
hand

we have the cellar
we have masonry
and trowel
perhaps we could simply
immure she

sure easy thing in the world
i
could whip up a little mortar in one
of those snow saucer lay the brick
anchor in some chain mountain have
a source for the manacle

ahh but gentleman we delude
ourselves
think of the woman
piteous moan as we lay tier upon
tier of brick
think of she
lamentation as we fit the last brick
into place appealing to we good
self the high angel of we
nature we recollection of we own
saint mother
no i fear that
we lack the sand to commit such an
act
no

short and most
painless be good

reality
Gawains gun
the retort
muffled by a pillow
into the
brain
the affair of an instant
the only question be
who wield
the weapon

such circumstance to draw straw

some be more receptive


i do not care they be receptive or

say they be devastated at the
prospect of not be able to
contribute to they respective
charity


well that be a shame

indeed
but at the end of the day
you position prevail and the man
have decided that we shall return
the money every last cent of it

than spend the remainder of we year
wasting away in the mississippi mens
correctional facility

be the original preference of some
