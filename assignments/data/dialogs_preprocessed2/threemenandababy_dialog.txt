in texas and the baby need to
get out to the park

yeah tell i about it
finding
time to take she to the park
every day be a real bitch

and i have to work i need the
money to survive and anyway i
love i job

but to work i have get to have
a babysitter and to have a
babysitter i need to work
so i run around all day
and i be not sure i be
taking good care of she

of course you be taking good
care of she we know what it be
like do not cry she look great

it be just because i have not sleep
in four night she must be
teething or something i do not
know but i can not manage

do not worry it be nothing she be

cutting a tooth you just have
to put some stuff on she gum

she pulled the same thing on we
we lost all we friend in one
night on account of one tooth

and just look at i face
Nobodys going to want i to
model for they with the way i
face look
and what will happen
to i if they do not want i
anymore

but you be beautiful at you
age all you need be a good night
sleep and you will look like new

right a good night sleep
but when

well why do not you leave the
baby with we for a few day
till you recuperate
i mean
if you want

we be old pro it be not a
big deal for we

blowing she nose
wipe she eye
really
i can leave she with
you for a little while

of course
leave she with we
come back whenever you want
get some rest

i bring a couple of thing
for she just for a few day


taking mary
in he arm
be she hungry

yeah it be time for she bottle
it be all ready in the bag

i will go heat up some water right
away
would you like a cup of
coffee

oh okay thank

i will go make up she bed

hey you guy come and see
come and see

what

come see i said

the poor thing she be really
wipe out


she will need two or three month
to recover at least
maybe
more

we could set up a room for she
here

room for she and a room for
mary

then we could have four shift
instead of three

yeah but i do not think she will
agree
she be get she own life
to live

yeah she probably would not want
to move here
she would think we would
jump on she any chance we could

but we would make a rule she would just
be one of the guy


she will never want to

so i will take the ten

to three


shift
and i will take every
other night
plus the walk in
the park in the afternoon before i
go to work
and we split the
rent equally
and i will just be
one of the guy
deal

deal
