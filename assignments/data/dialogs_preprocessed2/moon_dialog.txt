helium be a gas eject from the surface of the sun and
blown through space by solar wind
it play an essential role in cold fusion often tote as
the solution to humanities future energy need
there be one major problem
helium be extremely scarce on earth
the gas do
however exist in abundance on the earth only natural
satellite
the moon
should we turn to cold fusion in the future it be
conceivable that man will mine the moon for helium and
bring the precious gas back to earth


we hear something a machine and
constant
rhythmic
though the sound be slightly familiar
we be not sure what it be yet
hold for a few second and
then



the sound belong to a regular old like you see
in most gym across the world
running on it
mid
thirties thick beard handsome strike blue eye
sams face be flush and glisten with sweat
he lunge
for a towel draped over the treadmill bar dab he face
as he run
we see
gray powdery landscape
stretching beneath a



aerial view of the earth only natural satellite the
camera roam about a hundred foot off the surface
desolation
serious uncompromising desolation
this place
make antarctica look like tokyo
and utter silence
eventually the camera arrive at a moon base
towards it








sam take a shower tread in a tight circle beneath the
nozzle eye closed hot water blast he face



he hair still wet from the shower sam sit before a
dressed in a lunar industry boiler suit a zip up
the front colorful patch sew into the arm
he begin
to record a message

tess
hi
it be i
how be you
sweetheart
it be the morning
here
in a few minute gerty and
i will sit down for breakfast go
over the day itinerary
as sam continue he message we be given a of the
mining base
beginning with


this be where you want to be if the shit hit the fan
the
base equivalent of
wall of computer and flickering
digital display



today begin i th week on
selene
i officially have two
week to go before i climb into
that return vehicle


small space craft attached to the base
it be essentially
a tiny room with a coffin like seal bed in the middle of
it
a cryogenic with an array of complicate control
surrounding it



and blast home


sam spend most of he time here
it be kitchen and play
room combined
we a television set an armchair a
PingPong table the treadmill



i never dream i would make it this
far




there be time as you know



when i think i be going to
crack up





but i think i have come out the
other side now





in many way this place be all
about contradiction





it be bleak it be beautiful




it be barren yet filled with
riches





the earth be thousands and
thousands of mile away but
sometimes look so close i feel
like i could reach out and snatch
it with i hand





i be incredibly lonely yet i be
never alone



because i have you



and i have eve
i do not take you
guy for grant
you know that
now

little longer seventeen day
longer approximately

both dearly

sit

why

i want to check underneath there

you okay

i hardly touched you

let i see

get off i

sam snap on the with the remote start watch
LaughIn turn see sam wander by in the corridor
sam
consider calling out to he opt against it give the
he full attention


gerty be station at the old man collecting data
sam
enter

hello sam

hi gerty

we have a fight
i and the other
guy the other sam
we have a
fight gerty
he be a maniac
you
know what he do
he flip the
entire model over
do you know
how much work i have put into that
thing

hour

hour exactly
really
hour

approximately

he scare i gerty

what be it about sam that scare

i have send tess over a hundred
video message
where do those
message go
do they ever reach
she
pause

sam i can only account for what
occur on the base

what about the message she send
to i
long pause
finally gerty repeat

sam i can only account for what
occur on the base

gerty be i really a clone

sam when you first arrive at
selene there be a small crash
you wake up in the infirmary
you
suffer minor brain damage and
memory loss
i keep you under
observation and run some test

i remember

sam there be no crash
you
be be awaken
it be standard procedure for all
new clone to be given test to
establish mental stability and
general physical health
genetic
abnormality and minor
duplication error in the can
have considerable impact

and tess
eve

they be memory implant sam
i be very sorry

sam nod at this
he be brokenhearted
he begin to
leave

sam it be be several hour
since you last meal
can i
prepare you something

sam exit



sam enter the sleep quarter straighten the bed
and lie down
he pick up the picture of the pregnant
stare at it long and hard



the be off
sam be sitting arm folded entrench in

sam enter and head for the kitchen prepare himself a
snack
sam be aware that sam be there but keep his
eye focussed forward as immobile as a statue
eventually sam tentatively come over

you okay

i be stare into space
get it
sam do get it
he smile to be polite sit

how be the nose

well
beat

listen i go haywire before
i
lost it
i be sorry

fairfield you model that be
unacceptable
i do not know what be
wrong with i
i have get a temper
i need to do
something about it

yes you do
pause

i have be think
that rescue
unit eliza they will be here
in less than fourteen hour
i
do not know about you but i would like
to figure out where we stand
before they get here

absolutely

ostensibly they be coming to deal
with the stalled harvester
we
both know that be not true
they be coming to dig you body
out of that rover
they think
you be in there

right

what will they reaction be when
they find out you survive the
crash
i be not suppose to find
you
lunar instruct gerty to
lock i inside the base for
christs sake
pause
sam think it over

and there be something else
something i have not tell you


right around the time i be
awaken
i walk in on gerty
talking to central
he be have
a live conversation

live conversation

yeah

that be not possible

no no no it be possible
it be
possible because i see it that be
i point
sam feel himself losing he temper a little here
he
reign himself in

how do you know the conversation
be live

it be a back and forth exchange
and i see thompson and Overmeyers
up on the monitor
i be suppose
to be asleep in the infirmary
the moment i walk into the
comm room gerty terminated the
transmission
now i be a little
drugged up grant but i do not
imagine it

the communication equipment be
damaged there be a solar
storm

tabitha

tabitha right

lunar make it up
maybe
i do not
know
bottom line be they do not
want we to be able to contact
earth
otherwise why would they
have lie to we
pause
sam stare forward concentrate
sam
concentrate on sam


how be they block the live
feed
the base communication
equipment work fine

maybe they be not block the
signal from inside the base

from where then
as if reading each other mind the two sams head turn
to the window a slow perfectly synchronize movement
the lunar landscape as black and vast as ever
the view
almost cruel in it emptiness
it be not giving they any
answer not yet



sam speeding along in one of the rover
he wear his
space suit and resemble a cosmic race driver shift
up a gear the vehicle flirt with peak speed
he fly past one of the harvester speak through a
microphone inside he helmet

just passing the last of the
harvester look like john
all of this against the of the rover engine


driving away from base in a different direction sam
he
also wear a space suit
he also gun the engine
he also
have a microphone inside he helmet
the two clone be able
to talk back and forth with no delay

how long until you be out of the
base range
we between the two sams in they rover

if i maintain this speed
a
minute
ninety second top

you ever be this far out


no never

view from far away the rover speed less impressive
from a distance


as the sams continue to drive

you see anything yet

nothing
you

there be not shit out here
i
feel like i be about to drive off
the end of the world
it would help if i know what i
be looking for
through the glass of sam s helmet we see he
suddenly

wait a second wait a second
sam squint and lean closer towards the windshield like
he be trying to decipher a road sign

i see something

about a hundred foot away appear from thin air a
massive metal pole stretch up into the black sky

what be it

do not know yet
sam get closer

look like some kind of antenna


antenna
really
hang on look like there be one
on this side too
sam be indeed approaching something similar
sam stop he rover about twenty foot from the jammer
he
open the rover door and step out to take a close look

take in the jammer and the adjacent rover
sam loping
towards the jammer seemingly in slow motion
the be an intimidate stark pole
stabbed into the lunar landscape like the world big
caber
next to it sam be tiny a white dot as
insignificant as a pin prick
sam and sam
we cut back and forth between the two sams as they both
investigate the separate but identicallooking jammer

i can just make out the top
must
be a hundred foot tall at least
it be huge

whoever build these thing mean
business
they be not fuck
around
they voice they be excite to have make
this discovery they be not dealing with the negative
yet

what do you think

it not an antennae dude
it a
jammer
no wonder we can not get a live
feed
these thing must be
block we signal
suddenly sam double over
he vomit thick viscous
blood and sick into he helmet
revolting
the noise be over the microphone


you okay
no answer from sam
he backwards onto the
ground
he chest like he be be punched at from
the inside he spin over onto he front

sam
sam manage to climb to he foot head slowly back to
the rover he dip in close the door

sam can you hear i

yeah i hear you
i be going to head back to base
i be not feeling too good

i will stay out here a little
longer
i want to see if there
be any more of these thing
sam pull a youturn and begin he journey back to base
sam remains out by he jammer investigating far



sam at the wheel
he have pull he helmet off within
the safe pocket of the rover cabin
he be a grizzly mess
of splash sick and blood all over he face and chest
sam scream out with confusion frustration terror

fuck
he seize the steer wheel shake it
beginning to really


sam drive he rover into the dock not with his
customary precision park at an angle graze the wall
the rover door open and sam step out
unsteadily he face visibly through the glass of he
helmet

he across the dock do not even close the
rover door behind he head into the corridor


sam go swerve up the corridor like a drunkard
into wall he finally reach the bathroom and
duck in


sam sink to he knee before the toilet bowl
with great
effort he be able to remove he helmet placing it on the
floor next to he
he stare into the toilet
for a moment all be calm
the gentle pingpingping of a
computer somewhere inside the base
sam breathe steadily
spot of sweat on he upper lip
and then he
he vomit he vomit
he whole body forward in the process taught
tense like a dog be on a
sam vomit again
and again
and again
and stop

sam s vomit be he be throw up but
that be not all we can clearly see two or three
floating in the vomit

sam stand move to the mirror opening he mouth wide
to look for the miss tooth he use he thumb show
he gum revealing
yes he be lost at least a couple of
tooth
he flush the toilet



sam driving along in he rover
he come across another
one of these
he drive right up duck down
peer up through the windshield this new jammer be as
tall as the other in fact it be identical in every way
how many of these thing be there

sam circle the jammer in the rover drive on



sam enter and sit down at the old man
frantically he
start typing in number
an array of log entry appear
sam watch
one of they

january th lunar hour

all harvester running smoothly
today
readout be as follow
matthew
mile
mark

mile
these be just he log entry
what be he looking for
sam start scrol through the log entry like
he be chapter on a showing himself at
various stage of he time on selene he beard
essentially grow in as the message stretch
**further/far back eventually sam be clean shaven

luke
mile
john

mile
sam keep typing in number




no go
he try to hack he way in but be have no luck
one of Gertys long spindly slide into the room
sam
back away from the intimidate piece of machinery but it
stop within reach of the computer
sam watch as the arm reach forward and tap the
password in for he
it leaf the room the way it come
in
sam continue to go far and far back and
suddenly he up on the screen again or be it he

this sam up on the screen have stubble no beard and
look seriously i will
he be barely able to talk in fact he be


john
mile
sorry i be
not feeling too hot today i be
going to have to continue this
later
the become a and
continuing to through the log entry showing
yet more one have a one have a
one have grow out he hair and have a
we have see this particular sam before in an early scene
but all the sams have one thing in common
towards the
latter end of they log entry they all appear to be in
very bad physical shape

i have get blood coming out of
i nose

i do not feel too well old man

i hair falling out
look it
sam search even into the and uncover
yet more footage
we see the other sams returning to earth yet they do not
seem to go anywhere when they blast off the
remains in it bay
sam view different sams blast back to earth in the
return vehicle always with the same result the return
vehicle remain in it bay the sams seemingly
in one particularly sam view gerty
opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and
beginning to what appear to be or
sam understand now that the return vehicle be not a
spacecraft but some kind of


sam head into the return vehicle
it dominated by the
cryo pod used to hold astronaut in a state of cryogenic
sleep on they way back to earth
sam pop open the lid
and start frantically searching the chamber for of
the previous sams eventually finding particle of in
the crack

he close the lid
video showing a in a white
lab coat begin to play on a screen aim at the glass lid
of the pod
it be mute but we can hear a tinny version of
the audio coming from the cryo pod
sam push a button
on the monitor and we hear the audio properly

relax and breathe deeply
the
cryo pod be design to put you
into a deep sleep for the
duration of you three day return
journey back to earth
as you
begin to get sleepy think about
the magnificent job you have do
and how proud you family be of
what you have accomplished
relax music begin to play
after a moment the music
stop
there be a pause
then an almighty pulse of light
from the cryo pod
this be how sams past have meet they
end
nuke to ash like microwave meal in the cryo pod
sam inspect the control of the spacecraft to see if it
really be a vehicle in the process of he search he
find himself down on he knee checking out the wiring
suddenly sam s attention be on the floor
he
appear to be kneel on some kind of like a
tablet in the return vehicle floor he press he ear
against the panel
the panel sound

sam open a cubby swipe something similar to a
head out of the frame

back in the return vehicle sam stand over the panel in
the floor
he use the to prize the panel open
this take an extraordinary effort the panel eventually
like a manhole cover
sam can not believe he eye
at the top of the
leading down into darkness
there be


sam return from he tour of the perimeter of the base
pull up alongside sam s rover have to compensate for
he clone poor park job



sam exit the park bay and remove he helmet
down
the corridor he see sam standing outside the return
vehicle
facing he waiting

i see three more of those
jammer
the base be surround
i print out they coordinate
sam begin to remove a piece of paper from he pocket
but suddenly stop
he can tell by sam s expression that
something have happen

what
what be it

i find you secret room



standing over the open panel an anxious sam and sam
stare down

who go first
sam wordlessly take the lead crouch slightly to
seize the ladder and twist he body down into the hole
he
begin to
when he be roughly half way down sam
follow


sam reach the bottom of the ladder
he be in a dark
room a kind of if do crypt it would
look like this
the only light source right now be the come from the
return vehicle up above
sam hop down beside sam
squint into the darkness

be there a light
both sams along oppose wall sam eventually
finding a snap it on
an array of overhead fluorescent bulb begin to and
before the chamber completely

the two sams can hardly believe they eye
stretching back
maybe fifty foot be row and row of like upright
glass coffin and standing inside each pod an asofyet

it be like an of sam bell
spooky as hell
for a few moment sam and be too stun to speak
they walk to the end of the chamber and back again looking
at each clone one at a time all the clone be bare
chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover they
genital like a diaper
of course they all look the same that be why they be
clone but this piece of scientific wizardry be mind
boggle to sam and they at how each of the
clone be identical in every way and down to the minute
of detail same length of hair same skin tone same
fingernail

why be there so many of they

the cryo pod in the return
vehicle be an incinerator
sam react with appropriate shock

what

we do not go home
we be burned to
death up there
then the company
wake up a new one
every three
year
like clock work
sam absorb this
then

how do you know all this

i hack into the old man
actually gerty do
i see
footage
you be right there have
be other clone before we

how many

enough
pause


if that rescue unit find the two
of we awake at the same time
they will kill we both for sure
sam do not respond he be in he own world

what be we going to do
all of a sudden sam make a beeline for the ladder
start heading back up

where be you going


sam be digging in drawer remove some equipment some
wire
a radio a small machine called a
referred to as a
he be watch by gerty

sam can i help you with
something

not now gerty okay
gerty begin to slide out of the room
sam call after
he

gerty
why do you help i
with
the password
do not that go
against you program or
something

helping you be what i do
gerty leave
sam go on picking up equipment shove it all into a
backpack he swipe from a peg
now sam appear in the doorway

what be going on

there be something i have get to do

sam brush by sam on he way out


sam march up to he rover toss in the backpack and
dip inside without he helmet close the door and back
out into the black day


sam at the wheel floor the rover he look
possess determined a man on a mission

sams rover approach one of the many jammer that we now
know circle the perimeter of the base
sam stop the rover on the other side of the jammer
here outside the range of the jammer he figure he might
be able to get a signal through to earth
as he remove he equipment from the backpack and
start to uncoil wire insert a small onto
the back of the sit the on he lap
the
resemble a play station portable with it small but
nonetheless highquality screen
sam be not sure who to contact at first
finally he enter
some number from memory
the shaking in he hand
he
be nervous scare
he disable the video mode on he end
so he be only sending audio
moment of silence
the seem dead

come on
come on
then the the monitor the message seem
to have go through
and suddenly a appear on the screen
sam can not believe it
it be the same girl from his
hallucination
same wheatcolored hair
same freckle
dotting she cheek bone
same yellow dress
the moment sam see the girl he think naturally
that he be imagine thing again
but then she speak

hello

that be never happen before
sam finally manage to
respond

uh bell residence
the conversation have a very slight delay maybe a second or
two and the girl be not completely clear on the monitor
we
assume that these minor technical glitch be the same on
the girl end
the girl be sweet chirpy nothing like the haunting
ghostlike figure from sam s hallucination

this be the bell residence

i be trying to reach tess bell
the girl expression shift now somewhere between
melancholy and curiosity

i be sorry she passed away some
year ago
sam
he literally gasp
like someone just plunge
a paring knife into he belly

no
no way
the girl just stare

tess bell
be you sure

uh yeah i think so
i be she
daughter
can i help you
and astonishingly the news of Tesss death actually take
a back seat as sam be forced to confront this new
revelation
the girl be
sam be talking to he
sam tilt he head a smile twitch on he face

eve
sam can not believe it
she be beautiful
she be beautiful

moment
eve looking more closely trying to decipher sam
s face
tear glistening in he eye

but be still pull in intrigue

sams voice



what

dad there be someone asking about
mom
sams voice sound more as he come into
the room but we do not see he yet he sound

who be asking about mom
sam hurriedly shut off the
he sit there in the rover on the moon the middle of
nowhere hundreds and thousands of mile from earth
sam have never feel more alone than he do right now



the rover view from outside
we can not hear a thing
just
the endless and unrelenting
inside the rover we be able to make out sam quiver
at the wheel as he sob




the pingpingping of an alarm
appear on the old mans monitor

and




sam be sitting before the model
he be flip it back
over and return it to the table top
now he be attempting
to fix some of the demolish piece
at this moment he be
glue the spire back on the church
sam hear a sound from the corridor
moment later sam
appear in the doorway wearing the backpack
sam be beginning to look alarmingly i will
he depleting
health have be evident throughout the film but now it
seem to have jump to a new level
he watch sam for a little while

want i to help
sam shift over to give sam the adjacent chair
sam
walk over sit down
together they work on glue the
church back together

remember that crazy drink guy who
used to hang out by the church

sam nod remembering
pause

how do you carve these thing

sam nod
sam pick up a block of wood grab an exacto
blade
demonstrate

you need to hold the wood away

sam attempt to whittle
he smile a little embarrass

suddenly sam turn around and have a vicious cough fit
it actually seem to propel sam out of he chair and up
onto he foot
sam watch with concern
eventually the
cough subside

what be happening to you
sam avert he gaze

sam enter the rec room and shut the door
he move to
one of the table and sit down on the
we begin to rewatch the conversation

situation be unprecedented
the rule have have to change
do
you understand

unprecedented

good

a clone to wake up

clone be awake the moment he

but he be not
fully conscious for several
hour
beat

gerty we need to wake up a new
clone

i be not permitted to do that
sam

if we do not wake up another clone
i and the other sam will die
we will die gerty
do you
understand

yes


do you want i and the other sam
to die

that be the last thing i want

then you have to wake up a new
clone
okay pal
sam wait for a response
and wait




the pingpingping of an alarm
appear on the old mans monitor

and




sam fast asleep in bed

stretch of green grass dissect by a dirt path
light
breeze
endless blue sky above
no cloud
no visible sun


back on the sleep sam
deep breath
eyelid twitch
slightly

in the distance sitting beneath a tree on a blanket we
see
she be remove item from a picnic basket
sam enter the frame he back to the camera
he watch
he wife for a few moment maintain he distance
tess look up and see sam
she lift she hand wave


sams expression be blank at first but then he smile at
tess wave back


sam s eye open slowly
he be awake
be he dream a memory
premonition
or be it simply
make up

sam yawn and stretch he arm over he head
he reach across the bed and rip a couple of tissue from
a box of kleenex blow he nose
afterwards he check the tissue
a thick come out
of he nose the color and consistency of tomato puree
yeah gross
sam roll out of bed plant he foot on the ground
the base seem eerily quiet
too quiet
sam stand and
cross to the door


sam begin to walk left down towards the rec room and
the monitor station but hesitate he turn the other
way towards the infirmary head that way instead


lying in one of the infirmary bed eye closed a
of attached to he chest
sam
we do not know which
sam it be yet
he be clean shaven
he look like any one of
the clone down in the secret chamber
then again he could
just as easily be sam
and that be what sam naturally assume as he enter the
infirmary and see he lying there
sam move closer
curious until he be standing right at the edge of the bed
sam reach out he hand to wake he up when there be a
voice from the doorway behind

do not touch he

we suspicion be now confirmed
the sam in the infirmary
bed be a new clone
we will call he

he be not conscious yet
gerty and
i only wake he up a few hour
ago
sam be not even remotely on the same page

why
sam put he finger to he lip
then

come to the rec room
sam turn and leaf
sam follow slowly one or two
glance at the sleep clone along the way


we cut straight to the rec room and the conversation
between sam and sam

when the rescue unit arrive
they will expect to find a body in
the crash rover right
we have get we body

point towards the
infirmary
that guy
sam nod

they will expect to find a dead
body in the crash rover

i know

you be going to kill he

Someones get to pull the short
straw here well someone who be
unconscious than you or i

sam simply digest the gravity of sam s plan

if we go through with this i be
going to need you help haul
he out to the crash site

what about we
eliza arrive
find you and i as the welcome
party

they be not going to find you and
i as the welcome party they be
going to find i
you be going to
blast back to earth before they
get here in one of the helium
container
you be going home
sam be not expect that

you have do you three year
i
can not expect you to stick around
maybe you can meet eve in person
beat

i see the message on the
eve
be beautiful
she look like she
mom
sam realize that sam know everything
there be no
secret between they now
they both absorb the impact of knowing tess be dead
finally

how do you think she die

i do not know
jane die of cancer
i mean it
be in the family
who know
or
maybe it be an accident
could
have be a million thing

i wish i would be there


yeah
i too
the two sams sitting together by they grief



shot of selene from across the lunar plane
the base look
almost peaceful
no evidence of the going on inside


the two sams be testing out the to see if
they plan be going to work and sam can actually fit
inside
these container be design to carry cannister of
helium not to accommodate human being
sam look in increasingly bad shape
blanket draped
around he shoulder gaunt bob shiver

go for it
sam hunch and slowly insinuates himself into the
container yes he fit but it be tight like really
tight sam can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by
the time he step out onto terra firma

comfy

no
sam chuckle

but you fit
that be good
you
fit
with a sam sam from the container



gerty be running test on the unconscious sam

sam and sam stand on opposite side of the room
both
clone seem uneasy
they can not look at each other
they
can not look at sam
they eye roam every inch of the room
just about before finally settling on gerty
regardless of sam be unconscious be they really
going to kill he



sam sit at the comm unit recording the message a smile
plastered on he face as as it be

sam bell reporting to central

pacific time

sam be sitting on the edge of he bed holding the
photograph of the pregnant tess stare with great
concentration almost penetrative like he be trying to
will himself into the photograph
we find out what be running through he head cutting to

sam have go back to he dream or he vision of
tess sitting on the picnic blanket beneath the tree

sam and tess continue to wave to one another
sam have not
moved
tess call out

suddenly we hear a voice



sam


sam be standing at the door
sam look up at he

she be not
she be not

you be healthy
you have get three
year ahead of you
you stand a
much good chance than i do
the
other guy
gerty can get he up
to speed
he can be here to meet
eliza when they arrive
sam seem to have it all figure out
although sam
should in some way be relieve by sam s decision he
look closer to distraught

this be wrong
what be we
suppose to do
sit around here
and wait to die
fuck that

i do not know
it be what we be design to do
both sams struggle to hold in they emotion
sam morose
sam angry

screw that
i will go

and i be
going to find this asshole sam
bell and ask he why the hell he
put we through this shit
sam look concern

sam smile wearily watch he old self

you be a good guy sam

i might stop shave

no disrespect but i think it
about time i get some of i own
as well


yeah
you should travel
i have
always wanted to do that

i would like that



driving to the crash site
sam at the wheel sam riding
shotgun
both man stare ahead in silence

where all the trouble really start
matthew the stalled
harvester with the crash rover still trapped beneath it
the crash site be beginning to resemble some old underwater
shipwreck
the rover enter the frame beginning to slow down as it
approach the crash site
sam roll the rover to a
standstill about ten foot from the front of the harvester


sam keep the engine running as sam take a handful of
one by one washing down each pill with a
swig from a bottle of water
afterwards
a long pause
the two sams sit side by
side stare across the bleak landscape
neither of they
want to say goodbye particularly

tess come in for the interview
remember
sam be nodding away
of course he remember

she be so beautiful
even if she
be not the good candidate i just
know i have to give she the job
i
think she be so sweet
and then it be the end of the
summer

she be going back to san
francisco


you know you have to take a
chance
so you called she
you be terrify and write that
whole speech for she answer
machine
but i do not need it because tess
answer the phone
and i could
tell in she voice as we talk
she be think
why have sam called i

the internship over why be he
called i at home

and then i ask she if she be
going to adrian fiddle barbecue
and
sam have drop off to sleep
the back and forth exchange
be now essentially sam s monologue

that be when i know she liked i
because she do not want to talk
to anyone else
she would get up get
some potato salad go to the
bathroom but she would always come
back
and then we kiss
on the
step in front of she apartment
build
sam finally turn and look at sam
sam s head cock
to one side eye closed
sam lift the helmet off sam s lap carefully lower
the helmet onto sam s head


sam towards the crash rover holding sam in both
arm like a bride
he place sam on the ground and
open the rover door he slowly slide sam inside
inside the rover sam lie with he head jam awkwardly
against the passenger side door
at once he look peaceful
and wretchedly uncomfortable
sam can barely bring himself to look at sam
with both
hand he the door pivot around and slowly
back to he rover


sam driving back to base
he have remove he helmet and
be brushing tear from he eye with he glove





the pingpingping of an alarm
appear on the old mans monitor

and




gerty be continue to run test on sam
sam enter
he
carry the freighted exhaustion of a man who have just
completed a long and difficult journey

how long before he be conscious
gerty

the new clone will be conscious
within one hour

that be good
that be very good

sam
where be sam

he be go home gerty
sam leaf


sam be loading into the
in preparation for he trip back to earth
sam working a sense of
eliza will be there
in a mere minute
it be coming down to the wire
gerty glide in as he work

sam this be not going to work

what
why not

now sam load food into the cargo container moon
snack ration etc
and bottle of water
he final
addition be a kilo load of precious helium
good
million dollar worth

if the rescue unit examine i
memory bank they will discover
what have taken place over the
last week
as you know i record
everything
if they be
suspicious the first thing they
will do be search i memory
bank and this would put you in
considerable danger
sam straighten up giving gerty he full attention now
this be serious
it could ruin everything
the fact that gerty have bring it up indicate that the
robot loyalty lie ultimately with sam

i recommend erase i memory
bank
i can reboot myself once
you have depart

so that be what we be going to
have to do
be you ok with that

i will require you assistance
sam

sure just let i finish this
sam continue he work



sam asleep in bed very close to consciousness



sam inside the crash rover resemble a wild animal
pinned in a trap
he be still breathing


once again we see tess beneath the tree sitting on the
blanket
she look over at sam continuing to wave

come on sam
sam bell
come on
sam begin to walk towards tess


back on sam
the glass of he helmet be beginning to
with blood
sam see a sliver of the sun as he dawn on his
side of the moon
he close he eye for the last time



sam stand before gerty

i have set you computer to reboot
the second i have blasted off

okay sam

thanks for all you help gerty
i wish i could say i be going to
miss you buddy but to be
honest i can not wait to get away
from here

i understand sam
i hope life
be everything you remember it to
be

thanks
be you sure you be
going to be ok

of course
the new sam and i
will be back to we program
as soon as i have finished
reboot

gerty i be not programme

gerty do not respond
sam seem trouble
sam lean forward and activate the memory erase button
Gertys begin to and with
then slowly
the robot have be officially
gerty just stand there
completely still
as lifeless as a
toy
sam head out of the room at top speed


shot of the third of the harvester heading across
the lunar plane


sam pause at the window
looking for eliza
the rescue
unit be so close sam might actually be able to pick out
they spacecraft
and he can
it be tiny but nevertheless it be there a
metallic spacecraft glinting like a jewel and head
steadily towards the moon
there be not a moment to lose
sam swing around head
for the
we remain inside the monitor station as sam climb
inside the cargo container he ready himself
say a
little prayer and
he can not do it
curse at himself and
glance at the time ticking away before eliza land he
jump back out of the and run back into
the base



sam sit down before the old man
Elizas imminent
arrival cause increase and
sam take out the piece of paper on which the
of the jammer be printed out
he start to frantically type alter the of the




mark trundling along at halfspeed
the harvester suddenly
change direction veer sharply to the left and
heading up over a steep slope



back on sam as he type make an error scream

fuck
pound the delete button continuing to type coordinate
into the old man he be do
he leap out of he chair
and tear off through the base towards the cargo container



as Elizas spacecraft set it sight on selene we see the
cargo container through the sky in the opposite
direction



for a few moment all be quiet inside the base
the of the old man
the grind of a computer readout
this sequence echo the tour at the very start of the
film but the base have a decidedly different feel to it
now
it be like an abandoned house




on the monitor






box shaped spacecraft all menace and angle slowly
towards the lunar surface



gerty sit lifeless
we hear the sound of pressure door open
unrecognized
voice as the land crew enter the base calling for
sam
gerty come to life
he principal monitor and he pincerlike
begin to
he stream with
Gertys head begin to swivel leave and right as if he be
awake with a stiff neck eventually he sam
cross to he
just like that gerty continue he routine check of sam
study sam s heartbeat he brain activity the
robot literally picking up where he left off
and then sam s eye open
he be awake
he blink at
gerty cloudy groggy

where be i

sam you be in the infirmary
you
have an accident
sam stare ahead trying to dig up the memory

do you remember what happen

no gerty
i do not remember a thing
we hear heavy footstep and voice closer now just outside
the infirmary




of as the harvester churn along and
into an with full force
the jammer wobble unsteadily from the before
finally over the air with lunar dust



the cargo container through space fire blast
from it jet like the petal of an exotic flower



sam be seriously cramped inside one of the helium
container about as comfortable as a pony in a dog kennel
but nonetheless at the sheer velocity of
the container as well as and perhaps even more so the
fact that he have successfully escaped the base
he be going home



sam have stopped breathe
the sun shine on he face

sam walk towards tess
he sit down in front of she on the
blanket
beautiful picnic be spread out before they
tess have
never look so radiant so beautiful
light from the sky
pour into she upturn face

what take you so long
sam just smile back at she
she hand he a bottle of wine
and a corkscrew
not a cloud in sight but we be
just able to pick out the chalky outline of the
resemble a white thumb print in the blue sky

shot of the moon for a few second before we



on the comm unit monitor there be a of
follow by a
