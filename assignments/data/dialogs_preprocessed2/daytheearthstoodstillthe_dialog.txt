revise final draft
february

report be coming in from all over
the empire from all over the world
the government have not yet issued a
statement but there seem to be no
question that there actually be a
large unidentified object circling
the earth at incredible speed

staccato with
excitement
we still do not know what it be or
where it be from but we do know
there be something there
it be be
track around the world by radar
travel at a rate of four thousand
mile an hour

this be not another fly saucer
scare
scientist and military man
have already agreed on that
whatever
this be it be something real

we interrupt this program to give
you a bulletin just received from
one of we naval unit at sea

large object travel at supersonic
speed be headed over the north
atlantic toward the east coast of
the united states


with deliberately
control calm
here in the nation capital there
be anxiety and concern but no outward
sign of panic
as a matter of fact
there be sign of normalcy that
seem strangely out of place
the
beautiful spring weather the tourist
crowd at the various monument and
public building

they be here
they be here




get i the chief of staff



i want to speak to the president
i be sorry you will have to interrupt
he


good afternoon lady and gentleman
this be drew pearson
we bring you
this special radiotelevision
broadcast to give you the late
information on the land of the
space ship in washington

government and defense department
official be concern by report
of panic in several large eastern
city
i be authorized to assure
you that so far there be no reasonable
because for alarm
the rumor of
invading army and mass destruction
be base on hysteria and be
absolutely false
i repeat these
rumor be absolutely false

the ship design for travel outside
the earth atmosphere landed in
washington today at
p
m
eastern
standard time
we still do not know
where it come from but i can reveal
that military leader be consider
two possibility
that it come from
some unfriendly power here on earth
or that it actually arrive from
another planet

the ship be resting exactly where it
landed two hour ago and there have
be no sign of life from inside it

troop have be rushed from fort
myer and they have form a cordon
around the ship

they be supported by machine gun
tank and artillery

behind police line there be a large
crowd of curiosity seeker

as you can see for yourself the
army have taken every precaution to
meet whatever the situation may
require
every eye every weapon
be trained on the ship
it be be
this way for two hour and the tension

just a minute lady and gentleman
i think i see something moving

we have come to visit you in peace
and with good will

gort
Deglet ovrosco

it be a gift
for you president
glance at the break
object ruefully
with this he could have studied life
on other planet

be he all right

get hit in the shoulder sir

send for an ambulance
get he to
walter reed hospital right away

yes sir


how be he

he be all right general
blood
pressure a little high but it
could be aggravation

can not blame he
i always get mad
when somebody shoot i

he still want to see the president

we informed the white house over an
hour ago

do not drop any hint about where
he be from do he

no sir he do not

excuse i
what about the reporter colonel
they be swarm all over the lobby

tell they there will not be any statement
tonight

yes sir
glance down the
corridor
mr
Harleys here from the white
house

general

indicate Klaatus
room
right in there mr
harley

i name be harley secretary to
the president
Klaatu continue to
study he silently
i have be tell that you speak we
language that you name be mr
Klaatu

just Klaatu

the president ask i to convey his
deep apology for what have
happen
we all feel

sit down mr
harley

i be sure i do not have to point out
that you arrival be something of a
surprise
get a little
smile from Klaatu
he be encourage to
do some fish
have you be travel long

about five month you month

you must have come a long way

about million of you mile

naturally we be very curious to know
where it be you come from

easily
he be a
diplomat too
from another planet
let we just say
that we be neighbor

it be rather difficult for we to think
of another planet as a neighbor

i be afraid in the present situation
you will have to learn to think that
way

the present situation

i mean the reason for i come
here

we be very curious about that too
would you care to talk about it

i would be glad to
notice that harley
be settling himself
expectantly
not now of course with you alone

perhaps you would rather discuss it
personally with the president

this be not a personal matter mr
harley
it concern all the people
on you planet

startle by the scope
of this statement
i i be not sure i understand

i want to meet with representative
from all the nation of the earth

shock and perturb
by this notion
i be afraid that would be a little
awkward
it be it be completely
without precedent
and there be
practical consideration the time
involved the enormous distance

i travel million mile
what
about you unite nation

surprise and a little
puzzle
you know about the unite nation

we have be monitor you radio
broadcast for a good many year
that be how we learned you language
lately we have be get you
television also

you must have a rather strange
impression of we

the first two year of television we
be convince that all you do be
wrestle

i be sure you recognize from we broad
cast the evil force that have
produced the tension in we world
surely you would agree

i be not concern mr
harley with
the internal affair of you planet
i consider that to be you business
not mine

i be only hope to make you
understand

i mission here be not to solve you
petty squabble
it concern the
existence of every last creature who
live on earth

perhaps if you could explain a little

i intend to explain
to all the
nation simultaneously
he manner preclude
opposition
how do we proceed mr
harley

after a long
thoughtful moment
we could call a special meet of
the general assembly
but of course
the do not represent all of the
nation

then why not a meet of all the
chief of state

helplessly but
patiently
believe i you do not understand
they would not sit down at the same
table

i do not want to resort to threat
mr
harley
i simply tell you bluntly
that the future of you planet be at
stake
i suggest you transmit that
message to the nation of the earth

i will make that recommendation to
the president
he pick up he brief
case and hat
i must tell you in all honesty that
i be extremely dubious about the
result

apparently i be not as cynical about
earth people as you be

i have be dealing in earth politics
a good deal longer than you have
goodnight sir


get any place sergeant

no sir
shaking he head in
annoyance
beat i general
i see that ramp
come out of the side of the ship
right here
now i can not even find a
crack

what be the report carlson

we have tried everything from a
blowtorch to a diamond drill

what about he

he be make out of the same stuff

have he moved

no sir
not an inch

this be the tough material i ever
see general
for hardness and
strength it be out of this world

i can tell you officially that be
where it come from


the skeletal structure be completely
normal
same for the major organ heart
liver spleen kidney

and the lung be the same as ours
must mean a similar atmosphere
similar pressure
nodding toward
Klaatus room
how old do you think he be

oh i would say fortyfive

he told i this morning when i
examine he
he be seventyeight

i do not believe it

they life expectancy be a hundred
and thirty

how do he explain that

he say they medicine be that much
more advance
the major stare at
he blankly
he be very nice about it
but he
make i feel like a thirdclass witch
doctor

i take a bullet out of that mane
arm yesterday

what about it

i just examine the wound and it be
all heal

what do he say about it

say he put some salve on it some
stuff he have with he
show they a small
oddlooking tube in
he hand

what be you going to do with it

take it downstairs and have it
analyzed
on he way to the
door shaking he
head
then i do not know whether i will just
get drink or give up the practice of
medicine

afternoon mr
harley

afternoon gentleman

good afternoon
surprise not to
find he in bed
i be glad to see you up and around

thank you
have you any news

not very good news i be afraid
dig into his
briefcase for some
paper
the president accepted you suggestion
and cable the invitation for a
meet last night
let i read you some of the reply
he select a cable
and read
the premier wish to inform the
government of the united states that
it will be impossible for he to
attend the meet suggested by the
president unless the meet be hold
in moscow

with a grimlypointed
glance at Klaatu
harley read another
cable
the suggestion of the president
regarding the possibility of a meet
in moscow would be unacceptable to
she Majestys government at the
present time
representation could
be send only if the meet be
hold in washington

he look up at Klaatu
and shrug
well there you have it

i tried to make you understand
the
suspicion the jealousy the
mistrust
uneasily under
Klaatus level gaze
surely you realize that i government
have do everything in it power

it be not you government i be think
about
it be you world

now that you understand the situation
more clearly perhaps you would like to
discuss the matter with the president

i will not speak to any one nation
or group of nation
i do not intend to add i contribution
to you childish jealousy and
suspicion

we problem be very complex mr
Klaatu
you must not judge we too
harshly

i can judge only by what i see

you impatience be quite
understandable

i be impatient with stupidity
i
people have learned to live without
it

i be afraid i people have not
i be very sorry i wish it be
otherwise

before making any decision i think
i should get out among you people
become familiar with the basis for
these strange unreasoning attitude

under the circumstance i be afraid
that will be impossible

i must ask that you do not attempt to
leave the hospital
we military
people have insist on this
i be
sure you will understand




authority at walter reed hospital
refuse to comment on how he manage
to escape or what measure might be
taken to apprehend he

while the president make no effort
to minimize the crisis he urge
people all over the country to remain
calm
he said the entire facility
of and other federal agency
be be buy to bear
he pointed
out however that this be no ordinary
man hunt
he warn we may be up
against power that be beyond we
control


i can not stand any more of this
it be
enough to drive a person crazy

hey mom who be that


apologize nervously
for the tension in
the room
i i be sorry
what be it you want

i name be carpenter
i be looking
for a room

be you an man

no i be afraid not

bet he be mom
bet he be out looking
for that space man

with an apologetic
smile at Klaatu
i think we have all be hearing too
much about space man



starting the
introduction with
helen
this be mrs
benson mr
carpenter
with a smile that
would split a brick
and little bobby
indicate a middle
aged couple and a
young but more
wizen man
mr
and mrs
barley and mr
krull
i be mrs
crockett


please to the point
of challenge
well this be we little family
then get down
to business
i have a very nice room on the second
floor

can i help you look for the space
man
can i
i know what he look like
he be get
a square head and three great
big eye

goodnaturedly
calming he down
that be enough bobby
i think it be
time you go to bed


to bobby with a
prop smile
we must not annoy mr
carpenter or
he will not want to stay here
she go
on into the hall follow by Klaatu
who have exchanged a polite smile
with helen


he be really a dear little boy and
quiet as a mouse
with a shrewd chatty
smile
you be a long way from home be not
you mr
carpenter

how do you know


please with she
cleverness
oh i can tell a new england accent
a mile away


and so this sunday morning we
ask the question that be be plague
the entire nation for two day now
where be this creature and what be
he up to
if he can build a space
ship that can fly to earth and a
robot that can destroy we tank and
gun what other terror can he
unleash at will

obviously we
must find this monster
we must track
he down like a wild animal and
destroy he

but where would such a creature hide
himself
would he disappear into the
north wood
or would he slither off
into the sewer of some great city

there be grave danger everyone
agree to that
the question be what
can we do to protect ourselves
what
measure can we take that will


george i wish you would turn that radio
off
i be trying to concentrate


snort he toss
he paper down
why do not the government do
something that be what i want to
know


what can they do
they be only people
just like we


people i foot
they be democrat


it be enough to give you the shake
he be get that robot standing there
tenfoot tall just waiting for
order to destroy we

this space man or whatever he be
we automatically assume he be a
menace
maybe he be not at all


glaring at she for
this silly notion
then what be he hide for
why do not
he come out in the open


yeah
like the fella say
what be he up
to


maybe he be afraid


he be afraid

after all he be shoot the moment he
landed here
she pause for a
moment thoughtfully
i be just wonder what i would
do

perhaps before deciding on a course
of action you would want to know more
about the people here to orient
yourself in a strange environment


there be nothing strange about
washington mr
carpenter

quietly tongue in
cheek
person from another planet might
disagree with you


if you want i opinion he come from
right here on earth
with significant
emphasis
and you know where i mean


they would not come in a space ship
they would come in airplane


as though with
superior knowledge
i would not be so sure about that


deliver the final
word
stand to reason that fella want
some thing or he would not be here
that make sense carpenter

i must admit i be a little confuse


mrs
benson mr
stevens be here
to see you

oh thank you


finish you coffee george
i told
the carsons we would be there at eleven

good morning

we be all set
i picked up some
sandwich and put gas in the car
and the radio still bust so i
can forget about the space man for
today

there be only one thing i have not
be able to arrange for anyone to
stay with bobby
i do not suppose we could take he
with we

understandably
unenthusiastically
well we could

there be always somebody here but
today of course they have all get plan

i have not any plan

i would be glad to spend the day with
he if you would let i

say that be great
would not it
helen

hesitate a little
confused by the
offer
it be awfully nice of you to suggest
it
remembering the two
man have not meet
i be sorry mr
carpenter this be
tom stevens

bobby and i have a fine time yesterday
afternoon
we talk and listen
to the radio
i think today he might show i
around the city

suppose i ask bobby how he feel
about it

those be great word
with an air of
discovery
he must have be a great man


that be the kind of man i would like to
talk to

bobby who be the great man in
america today

gee i do not know
the space
man i guess

i be speaking of earth man
i mean
the great philosopher the
great thinker

you mean the smart man in the
whole world

yes that would do nicely

after a moment
thought
well professor Barnhardt i guess
he be the great scientist in the
world

he pause
thoughtfully speak
slowly as he recall
the newspaper story
he read
he life here in washington do not
he

sure
right near where i mother
works

where be that

department of commerce
she be a
secretary
they have a man they call the
secretary but he be not at all
i
mother a real secretary
after a moment
eagerly
mr
carpenter now can we go see
the space ship

boy i will bet he be strong
i bet he
could knock down a whole build

with a quizzical
smile
i should not be at all surprise

excitedly indicate
the ship
gee i would like to get inside and see
how it work
what do you think make
it go

quietly after a
glance around
well atomic power i would imagine

looking at Klaatu
incredulously
i think that be only for bomb

no
it be for a lot of other thing
too

you think it can go fast than an


yes i think so

about a thousand mile an hour

maybe four thousand mile an hour
and outside the earth atmosphere a
good deal fast

gee
how could they make a land

well there be several way to
reduce land speed
you see the
velocity

keep going mister
he be fallin
for it

you think they will ever find he

alter a momentos
pause
i do not know bobby
i be incline to
doubt it

as they continue
walk
mr
carpenter what do velocity
mean

velocity be the time rate of change
of position

i will bet that be the way professor
Barnhardt talk

bobby i have an idea
let we go
see professor Barnhardt and find out
how he talk

with a halfsmile of
accusation
you be just kidding be not you

would not you like to meet he

well sure i would but
he be to be not going
taken in
aw i will bet you would be scare

we can scare he more than he can
scare we

i like you mr
carpenter
you be a
real screwball


disappoint at the
thought
gee maybe he be not home

betcha this be where he work

indicate the
equation
what do that mean

it be a problem in celestial mechanic

bet he be the only one in the world
know the answer

he shake he head
smile
he do not know the answer
and he will
never get it that way

we probably could not get to see he
even if he be home

hey where you going

if he be that difficult to see perhaps
we ought to leave a calling card

what be you do in here

outraged by Klaatus
desecration of the
sacred blackboard
how dare you write on that blackboard
do you realize the professor have
be working on that problem for
week

controlling herself
with an effort
how do you get in here
and what do
you want

we come to see professor Barnhardt

well he be not here
and he will not be
back till this evening
i think you would well leave now
unruffled Klaatu turn to the desk
and scribble something on a scratch
pad
he tear off the piece of paper
and hand it to hilda

you might keep this
i think the professor will want to
get in touch with i

pointing to the
blackboard
i would not erase that
the professor
need it very badly

no sergeant there be no
classify material around but i

Klaatu glance at

understandingly
he be killed at a place called anzio

quietly sharp and
accuse
i suppose you know that Barnhardt

army

in this case the secret would not be
worth much
he do not know the answer
himself

but i suppose you know the answer

with a deprecating
shrug
it be really quite simple
the three
body problem you know

go and the
lieutenant growl as
he turn back to
Klaatu and the
detective
look like everybody going nut

they would have killed this man

people get hysterical enough they
do anything
look mr
carpenter if you can not
identify yourself i get to send you
over to the army

pretend impatience
but actually grow
concern
how long will that take

they can tell right away
they have
get a couple of doctor who see this
man in the hospital
take he over to

it be very important lieutenant
that i see professor Barnhardt

come on mr
carpenter

may i suggest that you call the
professor

get going will you brady before
i get mad

wait a minute brady
indicate order in
he hand
the captain here get order from
general cutler to take this man over
to professor Barnhardt



to Klaatu firmly but
respectfully
will you come with i sir

sorry to trouble you lieutenant




this be the man you wanted to see
professor

study Klaatu
curiously
thank you captain



i will wait outside

you write this

it be a clumsy way to introduce
myself but i understand you be a
difficult man to see
glance at the
blackboard
reproachfully
i think you would have the solution by
this time

not yet
that be why i wanted to see
you

all you have to do now be substitute
this expression
pointing to a specific
place
at this point

yes that will reproduce the first
order term
but what about the effect
of the other term

almost negligible
with variation
of parameter this be the answer

how can you be so sure
have you
tested this theory

i find it work well enough to get
i from one planet to another
Barnhardt stare at
he blankly
i understand you have called a meet
to study we space ship

as though unsure of what he be hear
yes yes i have

i name be Klaatu
note that
Barnhardts expression
be changing from
amazement to
incredulity
i spent two day at you walter reed
hospital
room
i doctor name
be major white and i have a very
attractive nurse called ruth who be
get marry next wednesday
Klaatu wait for
this to sink in
then speak with
quiet authority
if you be not interest or if
you intend to turn i over to you
army we need not waste any more
time

to the captain he
voice a little
unsteady
you can go now captain
please thank
general cutler and tell he tell
he that i know this gentleman

you have faith professor Barnhardt

it be not faith that make good
science mr
Klaatu
it curiosity
unable to conceal
he interest
sit down please
i have several
thousand question to ask you

ignore the
invitation
i would like to explain something of
i mission here

that be i first question

it be i intention to discuss this
officially with all the nation
of the earth but i be not allow
the opportunity
i have come to
realize since that you mutual fear
and suspicion be merely the normal
reaction of a primitive society
we know from scientific observation
that you have discover a rudimentary
kind of atomic energy
we also know
that you be experiment with
rocket

yes that be true

in the hand of a mature civilization
these would not be considered weapon
of aggression
but in the hand of
you people
he shrug and shake
he head
we have observed you aggressive
tendency and we do not trust you
with such power

if you mean that you be afraid of
we

with cool impressive
emphasis
we want to be sure you do not make
let we say an unfortunate mistake
we know the potentiality of these
development and we be disturbed to
find they in the hand of child
you see we have have atomic energy for
five thousand of you year
indicate the
telephone
we discarded instrument like this
many century ago
so long as you be limit to
fighting among yourselves with
you primitive tank and plane
we be unconcerned
but soon you
will apply atomic energy to space
ship and then you become a threat
to the peace and security of other
planet
that of course we cannot
tolerate

thoughtful and
impress
these other planet do they have
peace and security

we have we atomic war thousands
of year ago
after that we fight with bow and
arrow
then slowly we learned
that fight be no solution that
aggression lead to chaos

we scientist understand this
even
we primitive scientist
what exactly be the nature of you
mission mr
Klaatu

i come here to warn you that by
threaten danger you planet face
danger very grave danger
i be
prepare however to offer a
solution

would you care to be more specific

what i have to say must be say to
all concern
with a suggestion of
deference to Barnhardt
it be too important to be entrust
to any individual

i gather that you effort on the
official level be not entirely
successful

sternly as this
unpleasant episode
be recalled
i come to you as a last resort
and i confess that i patience be
wearing thin
must i take drastic action in order
to get a hear

what what sort of action do you
mean

violent action since that seem
to be the only thing you people
understand
Leveling the island of manhattan
perhaps or dropping the rock of
gibraltar into the sea

would you be will to meet with
the group of scientist i be calling
together
perhaps you could explain
you mission to they and they in
turn could present it to they various
people

that be what i come to see you about

it be not enough to have man of
science
we scientist be too easily
ignore or misunderstood
we must
get important man from every field
educator philosopher church
leader man of vision and
imagination the fine mind in
the world

i leave that in you hand

you would have no objection to revealing
yourself at this meet

no not at all

what about you personal safety in
the meantime
what about the army
and the police

i name be carpenter and i be a very
earthy character living in a
respectable board house

smile but a little
concern
i be afraid i can not offer you any
real protection
i have no influence
in case of interplanetary
conspiracy

i be sure i will be quite safe until
the meet

he suddenly pause
thoughtfully
one thing mr
Klaatu
suppose this
group should reject you proposal
what be the alternative

with a sense of quiet
inescapable power
i be afraid you have no alternative
in such a case the planet earth
would have to be
he look for the
right word
eliminate

such power exist

i assure you such power exist

the people who come to the meet
must be make to realize this
they
must understand what be at stake
after a thoughtful
moment he look up
you mention a demonstration of
force

yes

would such a demonstration be
possible before the meet

yes of course

something that would dramatize for
they and for they people the
seriousness of the situation
something that would affect the entire
planet

that can easily be arranged

frighten by his
easy assumption of
infinite power
i would not want you to harm anybody
or destroy anything

why do not you leave it to i
i will
think of something

with a nervous half
smile
maybe a little demonstration

something dramatic but not
destructive
it be quite an interesting problem
would day after tomorrow be all right
say about noon



go out dear

yes i be waiting for tom to pick i
up


personally i will not go out after
dark these day
with an attempt at
slyness
but then i be not court be i


oh mr
carpenter

everyone seem so
he shake he hand
to indicate
nervousness

jittery be the word

with a contemplative
smile
Bobbys the only person i know who
be not jittery

he have he homework to keep he
occupied

he be a fine boy mrs
benson

i be sorry

she be sensible and
objective but not

i think i be very lucky

always get a chance to recognize a
mistake before you make it

lady and gentleman

i called you from you work and from
you home all over the world because
we be to meet here tonight with a
man from another planet the man
who come here in this ship
there be audible
exclamation of
surprise and
disappointment
as you all know this be no longer
possible
i can only say that i share
the bitterness of you disappointment

gort berengo

under the circumstance the army
people have ask we to leave the
build
and since they concern
be for we safety i can do nothing
but suggest that we comply

straightforwardly
with almost stern
authority
i be leaving soon and you will forgive
i if i speak bluntly
he pause study
the face
the universe grow small every day
and the threat of aggression by any
group anywhere can no longer
be tolerate

there must be security for all or
no one be secure
this do not
mean giving up any freedom except
the freedom to act irresponsibly

you ancestor know this when they
make law to govern themselves
and hire policeman to enforce they

we of the other planet have long
accepted this principle
we have an
organization for the mutual protection
of all planet and for the complete
elimination of aggression
sort of
unite nation on the planetary
level
the test of any such high
authority of course be the police
force that support it
for we
policeman we created a race of robot
they function be to patrol the
planet in space ship like this
one and preserve the peace
in
matter of aggression we have given
they absolute power over we

at the first sign of violence they
act automatically against the
aggressor
and the penalty for
provoking they action be too terrible
to risk

the result be that we live in peace
without arm or army secure in
the knowledge that we be free from
aggression and war free to pursue
more profitable enterprise
we do not pretend to have achieve
perfection but we do have a system
and it work
with straightforward
candor
i come here to give you the fact
it be no concern of ours how you run
you own planet but if you threaten
to extend you violence this earth
of yours will be reduced to a burn
out cinder

you choice be simple
join we and
live in peace
or pursue you present
course and face obliteration
we will be waiting for you answer
decision rest with you
