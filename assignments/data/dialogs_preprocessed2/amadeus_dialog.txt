i
be the most famous composer in europe
when you be still a boy

forty opera alone
what about this
little thing

the tiny town in italy i know
of he




i be still playing childish game
when he be playing music for king
and emperor
even the pope in rome




i admit i be jealous when i hear
the tale they told about he
not
of the brilliant little prodigy
himself but of he father who have
taught he everything



i father do not care for music
he
wanted i only to be a merchant
like himself
as anonymous as he
be
when i told how i wished i could
be like mozart he would say why
do you want to be a train monkey
would you like i to drag you around
europe do trick like a circus
freak
how could i tell he what
music mean to i




even then a spray of sound note
could make i dizzy almost to
falling



whilst i father pray earnestly to
god to protect commerce i would
offer up secretly the proud prayer
a boy could think of
lord make i
a great composer
let i celebrate
you glory through music and be
celebrated myself
make i famous
through the world dear god
make i
immortal
after i die let people
speak i name forever with love for
what i write
in return i vow i will
give you i chastity i industry
i deep humility every hour of
i life
and i will help i fellow
man all i can
amen and amen



and do you know what happen

miracle

suddenly he be dead
just like that
and i life changed forever

extraordinary
on the page it look
nothing
the begin simple almost
comic
just a pulse bassoon and
basset horn like a rusty
squeezebox
then suddenly high
above it an oboe a single note
hanging there unwavering till a
clarinet take over and sweeten it
into a phrase of such delight
this
be no composition by a perform
monkey
this be a music i would never
hear
fill with such long
such unfulfillable long it have
i trembling
it seem to i that i
be hearing a voice of god

excuse i



but why

why
would god choose an obscene
child to be he instrument
it be
not to be believe
this piece have
to be an accident
it have to be

how good be he this mozart

he be remarkable majesty
i hear an
extraordinary serious opera of he
last month
idomeneo king of crete

that
most tiresome piece
i hear
it too

tiresome

young man trying to impress beyond
he ability
too much spice
too
many note

majesty i think it the most
promise work i have hear in year

Ahha
well then we should make
some effort to acquire he
we could
use a good german composer in vienna
surely

i agree majesty but i be afraid
it be not possible
the young man be
still in the pay of the archbishop

very small pay i imagine
i be sure
he could be tempt with the right
offer
say an opera in german for
we national theatre

excellent sire

but not german i beg you majesty
italian be the proper language for
opera
all educated people agree on
that

Ahha
what do you say chamberlain

in i opinion it be time we have a
piece in we own language sir
plain
german
for plain people

Ahha
kapellmeister

majesty i must agree with herr
Dirretore
opera be an italian art
solamente
german be scusate too
bruta for singing too rough

Ahha
court composer what do you
say

i think it be an interesting notion
to keep mozart in vienna majesty
it should really infuriate the
archbishop beyond measure if that
be you Majestys intention

even though engaged to be marry

and no rebuke at all
be it possible
i be be tested
be god expect
i to offer forgiveness in the face
of every offense no matter how
painful

for that little man
for the first
time in i life i begin to know really

safe

excellency
you see he do not know
i be here

really

i husband be a proud man sir

would be furious if he know i would come

no sir
this be i own idea

i see

sir we really need this job
we be
desperate
i husband spend far
more than he can ever earn
i do not
mean he be lazy he be not at all
he work all day long
it be just
he be not practical
money simply
slip through he finger it be really
ridiculous you excellency
i know
you help musician
you be famous
for it
give he just this one post
we would be forever indebted

let i offer you some refreshment
do you know what these be

original

original

yes

these be original

yes sir
he do not make copy


astound
it be actually beyond
belief
these be first and only
draft of music yet they show no
correction of any kind
not one
do you realize what that mean

he would simply put down music already
finished in he head
after
page of it as if he be just taking
dictation
and music finished as no
music be ever finished



displace one note and there would be
diminishment
displace one phrase
and the structure would fall
it be
clear to i
that sound i have hear
in the archbishop palace have be
no accident
here again be the very
voice of god
i be stare through
the cage of those meticulous ink
stroke at an absolute inimitable
beauty

be it no good

it be miraculous

oh yes
he be really proud of his
work

so will you help he

tomorrow night i dine with the
emperor
one word from i and the
post be his

of chastity

good patient hardworking chaste
what do it matter
have goodness
make i a good composer
i realized
it absolutely then that moment
goodness be nothing in the furnace
of art
and i be nothing to god

you cannot say that

no
be mozart a good man

god way be not yours
and you
be not here to question he
offer
he the salt of penitence
he will
give you back the bread of eternal
life
he be all merciful
that be
all you need to know

all i ever wanted be to sing to
he
that be he doing be not it
he
give i that long then make i
mute
why
tell i that
if he do not
want i to serve he with music why
implant the desire like a lust in
i body then deny i the talent
go
on tell i
speak for he

i son no one can speak for god

so speak now
answer i

i do not claim to unravel the
mystery
i treasure they
as you
should

oh yes yes yes yes yes
always
the same stale answer
intimately to the
priest
there be no god of mercy father
just a god of torture

father

hush
i be talking to he majesty
you majesty i wish to express only
one thing that you who be the
father of we all could teach we
child the gratitude they owe to
father
it be not for nothing that
the fifth commandment tell we
honour you father and mother that
you day may be long upon the earth


Ahha
well
there it be


i have just learned something that
might be of interest to you herr
director

yes

mozart be writing a new opera
an
italian opera

italian

aie

and that be not all
he have chosen
for he subject figaro
the marriage
of figaro

you mean that play

exactly

he be setting that play to music

yes

you must be mad

what be this marriage of figaro

it be a french play kapellmeister
it have be banned by the emperor

hah

be you absolutely sure

i have see the manuscript

where

never mind


i know we banned this play but
frankly i can not remember why
can
you refresh i memory herr director

for the same reason herr chamberlain
that it be banned in france

oh yes yes
and that be

well the play make a hero out of a
valet
he outwit he noble master
and expose he as a lecher
do you
see the implication
this would be
in a grand situation as if a
chamberlain be to expose an emperor

ah


herr mozart

sit down gentleman please

mozart be you aware i have declared
the french play of figaro unsuitable
for we theatre

yes sire

yet we hear you be making an opera
from it
be this true

who told you this majesty

it be not you place to ask question
be it true

well yes i admit it be

would you tell i why

well majesty it be only a comedy

what you think mozart be scarcely
the point
it be what he majesty
think that count

but you majesty

motion he to be
silent
mozart i be a tolerant man
i do
not censor thing lightly
when i
do i have good reason
figaro be a
bad play
it stir up hatred between
the class
in france it have cause
nothing but bitterness
i own dear
sister antoinette write i that she
be beginning to be frighten of she
own people
i do not wish to see the
same fear starting here

sire i swear to you majesty there be
nothing like that in the story
i
have taken out everything that could
give offense
i hate politics

i think you be rather innocent i
friend
in these dangerous times i
cannot afford to provoke we noble
or we people simply over a theatre
piece

but majesty this be just a frolic
it be a piece about love

ah love again

but it be new it be entirely new
it be so new people will go mad for
it
for example i have a scene in
the second act it start as a duet
just a man and wife quarreling
suddenly the wife scheme little
maid come in unexpectedly a very
funny situation
duet turn into
trio
then the husband equally
scream valet come in
trio turn
into quartet
then a stupid old
gardener quartet become quintet
and so on
on and on sextet septet
octet
how long do you think i can
sustain that

i have no idea

guess
guess majesty
imagine the
long time such a thing could last
then double it

well six or seven minute
maybe
eight

twenty sire
how about twenty
twenty minute of continuous music
no recitative

mozart

sire only opera can do this
in a
play if more than one person speak
at the same time it be just noise
no one can understand a word
but
with music with music you can have
twenty individual all talking at
once and it be not noise it be a
perfect harmony
be not that marvelous

mozart music be not the issue here
no one doubt you talent
it be
you judgment of literature that be
in question
even with the politics
taken out this thing would still
remain a vulgar farce
why waste
you spirit on such rubbish
surely
you can choose more elevate theme

elevated
what do that mean
elevated
the only thing a man should
elevate be oh excuse i
i be sorry
i be stupid
but i be feed up to the
tooth with elevate thing
old dead
legend
how can we go on forever
writing about god and legend

because they do
they go on forever
at least what they represent
the
eternal in we not the ephemeral
opera be here to ennoble we
you and
i just as much as he majesty

bello
bello barone
Veramente

oh bello bello bello
come on
now be honest
would not you all
rather listen to you hairdresser
than hercules
or horatius
or
orpheus
all those old bore
people
so lofty they sound as if they shit
marble

what

govern you tongue sir
how dare
you

forgive i majesty
i be a vulgar
man
but i assure you i music be
not

you be passionate mozart
but you
do not persuade

sire the whole opera be finished
do you know how much work go into
it

he majesty have be more than
patient signore

how can i persuade you if you will not
let i show it

that will do herr mozart

just let i tell you how it begin

herr mozart

may i just do that majesty
show
you how it begin
just that

please

look
there be a servant down on his
knee
do you know why
not from any
oppression
no he be simply measuring
a space
do you know what for
he
bed
he wedding bed to see if it
will fit



well mozart be already rehearse

incredible

the emperor have given he permission

si si
Veramente

well gentleman so be it
in that
case i think we should help mozart
all we can and do we good to protect
he against the emperor anger

what anger

about the ballet

ballet
what ballet

excuse i do not he majesty
specifically forbid ballet in his
opera

yes absolutely
be there a ballet
in figaro

yes in the third act


mozart
herr mozart may i have a
word with you please
right away

certainly herr director

five minute please

do you not know that he majesty
have expressly forbid ballet in
he opera

yes but this be not a ballet
this
be a dance at Figaros wedding

exactly
dance

but surely the emperor do not mean
to prohibit dancing when it be part
of the story

it be dangerous for you to interpret
he Majestys edict
give i you
score please

thank you

what be you do

what be you do herr director

take out what you should never
have put in


herr mozart

please
please
i have no one else to
turn to
please

wolfgang what be it
sta calmo per
favore
what be the matter

it be unbelievable
the director have
actually ripped out a huge section
of i music
page of it

really
why

i do not know
they say i have get to
rewrite the opera but it be perfect
as it be
i can not rewrite what be
perfect
can not you talk to he

why bother with OrsiniRosenberg
he be obviously no friend of yours

oh i could kill he
i mean really
kill he
i actually threw the entire
opera on the fire he make i so
angry

you burned the score

oh no
i wife take it out in time

how fortunate

it be not fair that a man like that
have power over we work

but there be those who have power
over he
i think i will take this up
with the emperor

oh excellency would you

with all i heart mozart

thank you
oh thank you

withdrawing it
imitate the emperor
no no no herr mozart please
it be not a holy relic

i be sure i do not need to tell you i
said nothing whatever to the emperor
i go to the theatre ready to tell
mozart that he majesty have fly
into a rage when i mention the
ballet when suddenly to i
astonishment in the middle of the
third act the emperor who never
attend rehearsal suddenly
appear

what be this
i do not understand
be it modern

majesty the herr director he have
remove a balleto that would have
occur at this place

why

it be you regulation sire
no ballet
in you opera

do you like this salieri

it be not a question of liking you
majesty
you own law decree it
i be afraid

well look at they

no no no
this be nonsense
let i
hear the scene with the music

but sire

oblige i

yes majesty

can we see the scene with the music
back please

oh yes certainly
certainly herr
director

lady and gentleman we be going
from where we stopped
the count
Anches so
right away please

what i hope by that edict director
be simply to prevent hour of dance
like in french opera
there it be
endless as you know

quite so majesty



so figaro be produced in spite of
i
and in spite of i a wonder be
revealed
one of the true wonder of
art
the restore third act be bold
and brilliant
the fourth be a
miracle



i see a woman disguised in she maid
clothes hear she husband speak the
first tender word he have offered
she in year only because he think
she be someone else
i hear the
music of true forgiveness fill
the theatre confer on all who
sit there a perfect absolution
god
be singing through this little man
to all the world unstoppable
making i defeat more bitter with
each pass bar

and then suddenly a miracle



father do you know what that mean
with that yawn i see i defeat turn
into a victory
and mozart be lucky
the emperor only yawn once
three
yawn and the opera would fail the
same night
two yawn within a week
at most
with one yawn the composer
could still get


nine performance
nine
that be all
it be have and withdraw

i know
it be outrageous
still if
the public do not like one work
one have to accept the fact gracefully

but what be it they do not like

well i can speak for the emperor
you make too many demand on the
royal ear
the poor man can not
concentrate for more than an hour
and you give he four

what do you think of it yourself
do you like it at all

i think it be marvelous
truly

it be the good opera yet written
i
know it
why do not they come

i think you overestimate we dear
viennese i friend
do you know you
do not even give they a good bang at
the end of song so they know when
to clap

i know i know
perhaps you should
give i some lesson in that

i would not presume
all the same if
it would not be imposing i would
like you to see i new piece
it
would be a tremendous honour for i

oh no the honour would be all mine

grazie mio caro wolfgang

grazie a lei signor antonio




what be this
i never see he excite
before by any music but he own
could he mean it

would he actually tell i i music
have moved he
be i really going to
hear that from he own lip
i find
myself actually hurry the tempo
of the finale


well

sublime
utterly sublime

that kind of music should be
punishable by death


i believe that be the good opera yet
written i friend
salieri you
be the bright star in the musical
firmament

say salieri with loathing
and that be
i immortality at last

pity yourself
you
serve a wicked god
he killed mozart
not i

without pity
he destroyed he beloved
rather than let a mediocrity like i
get the small share in he glory
he do not care
understand that
god care nothing for the man he
deny and nothing either for the
man he use
he broke mozart in half
when he would finished with he and
threw he away
like an old wear
out flute

lord


why do he do it
why do not he kill

what be the
use keeping i alive for thirtytwo
year of torture
Thirtytwo year
of honour and award

be bow to and saluted called
distinguished distinguish
salieri by man incapable of
distinguish
Thirtytwo year of
meaningless fame to end up alone in
i room watch myself become
extinct
i music growing faint
all the time faint until no one
play it at all
and he grow
louder filling the world with wonder
and everyone who love i sacred art
crying mozart
bless you mozart

good morning professor

the water closet
and then we have get
you favourite breakfast for you
sugarrolls
he love those
fresh sugarrolls

world
i be they champion
i be
they patron saint
on they behalf
i deny he you god of no mercy
you god who torture man with
longing they can never fulfill
he
may forgive i
i shall never forgive
he

mediocrity everywhere now and to
come
i absolve you all
amen
