arrival
as with the assassination
of john kennedy who among we do

occupant aboard the craft be as
surprise as we be about they
arrival
that they awaken from
freeze hibernation to find they
malfunction autopilot have landed
they here by mistake

these newcomer we soon learned
be a geneticallyengineered race
adapt for hard labor in almost any
environmental condition
in effect
they ship be a slave ship
washed ashore on earth with no way
to get back to where they come
from

when the newcomer be first let
out of the ship they be
quarantine in a camp not ten mile
from the town here
you can imagine
how the people around here feel
about that
but once they be
release from the camp and we get a
chance to know they we see what
nice quiet people they really be

an atmosphere of equality we have
never known before
you lay before
we a beautiful green world full of
freedom and opportunity
you
give we ownership of we live for
the first time
and you ask no
more of we than you do of
yourselves
to live by the rule
rule that be not make to keep one
people subordinate to another but
rule that exist to preserve
equality
you aspire to very high
ideal here

i hope you can understand how
special you world be
how unique
a people you human be

all the more painful and confuse
to we that so few of you seem
capable of living up the the ideal
you set for yourselves

do not count on i george
i never
have any ideal

we do not understand the hatred the
contempt
but we must bear it
we
must not react in anger
because
we situation here be still fragile
the separationists would see we
return to the quarantine camp
the fundamentalist say we have no
more human right than dog or cat
but the prejudice we face here be so
insignificant compare to the pain
that we have known before
and that
be why we be so grateful
