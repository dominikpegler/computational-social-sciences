he will be saying prayer in the
garden just follow the other

brother Bapu be already late for
prayer

oh god
oh god

the object of this massive tribute
die as he have always live a
private man without wealth without
property without official title or
office

mahatma gandhi be not a commander
of great army nor ruler of vast
land he could boast no scientific
achievement no artistic gift
yet man government and dignitary
from all over the world have joined
hand today to pay homage to this
little brown man in the loincloth
who lead he country to freedom

pope pius the archbishop of
canterbury president truman chiang
kaishek the foreign minister of
russia the president of france
be among the millions here and abroad
who have lament he pass
in
the word of general george
marshall the american secretary of
state mahatma gandhi have become
the spokesman for the conscience of
mankind


a man who make humility and simple
truth more powerful than empire

and albert einstein added
generation to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this ever
in flesh and blood walk upon this
earth


but perhaps to this man of peace
to this fighter who fight without
malice or falsehood or hate the
tribute he would value most have come
from general douglas mcarthur
if
civilization be to survive the
general said this morning all man
cannot fail to adopt Gandhis belief
that the use of force to resolve
conflict be not only wrong but
contain within itself the germ of
we own selfdestruction


perhaps for the rest of we the most
satisfy comment on this tragedy
come from the impudent new york
which today write there be still
hope for a world which react as
reverently as ours have to the death
of a man like gandhi


tell i do you think about hell

hell


the eternal earnest
sophomore

to the book
but this man be a christian and he
have written

firm

there be no
colored attorney in south africa

sir i be called to the bar in london
and enrol in the high court of
chancery i be therefore an
attorney and since i be in you
eye colore i think we can
deduce that there be at least one
colored attorney in south africa

smart bloody kaffir throw he
out

you move you damn sammy carcass
back to third class or i will have you
throw off at the next station

anger a touch of
panic
i always go first class
i have
travele all over england and i have
never

but you be a rich man why do you
put up with it

i be rich but i be indian
i
therefore do not expect to travel
first class

in england i be a poor student but
i

that be england

this part of englands empire

mr
gandhi you look at mr
khan and
see a successful muslim trader
the
south african see he simply as an
indian
and the vast majority of
indian mostly hindu like yourself
there be a moment of
blink embarrassment
from gandhi at this
mention of he own
religion
be bring here to work the mine
and harvest the crop and the
european do not want they do
anything else

but that be very unchristian

mr
gandhi in this country indian
be not allow to walk along a
pavement with a christian

you mean you employ mr
baker as
you attorney but you can not walk
down the street with he

i can
but i risk be kick into
the gutter by someone less holy
than mr
baker

well then it must be fight
we
be child of god like everyone
else

allah be praise
and what battalion
will you call upon

i i will write to the press
here and in england
he turn to baker
firmly
and i will use the court

you will make a lot of trouble

we be member of the empire
and we
come from an ancient civilization
why should we not walk on the
pavement like other man

i rather like the idea of an indian
barrister in south africa
i be sure
we community could keep you in work
for some time mr
gandhi even if
you cause a good deal of trouble
gandhi react
uncertainly

especially if you cause a good deal
of trouble

there be the english reporter
i told
you he would come

you also said you article would
draw a thousand people
if the crowd number
they be lucky

at least some of the hindu bring
they wife

no
i ask i wife to organize that

some of they be leaving

lady and gentleman we have ask
you to gather here to help we proclaim
we right to be treated as equal
citizen of the empire

we do not seek conflict
we know the
strength of the force array against
we know that because of they we can
only use peaceful means but we
be determine that justice will be
do

the symbol of we status be embody
in this pass which we must carry
at all time but no european even
have to have

and the first step to changing we
status be to eliminate this difference
between we

you write brilliantly but you have
much to learn about handle man

the read not
fluent but firm and
pointed
we do not want to ignite
the fear
or hatred of anyone
but we ask you
hindu muslim and sikh to help we
light up the sky
and the mind of
the british authority with we
defiance of this injustice

we will now burn the pass of we
committee and it supporter
we ask
you to put you pass on the fire
with

oh no you bloody well do not

those pass be government property
and i will arrest the first man who
try to burn one

take he away

now be there any more

you little sammy bastard i

you want that kind of trouble you
can have it

let i go

stop

you saved the paper

i wish you be still struggling for
work in bombay

i hated that all the pettiness
the little corruption
reflective grin

and i be more laughing stock than
lawyer

but they needed i here
if i would never
be throw off that train perhaps
no one would ever have needed i

high court judge have confirmed
that mr
gandhi would have be within
he right to prosecute for assault
since neither he nor mr
khan resist
arrest
i told you about english
law

as i told you about english policeman

yes

we be glad to have you back Bapu

and i be glad to be back
he hold he hand
out to Ramdas

come

be careful

tomorrow i will tell you what it
feel like to be a jailbird

come
come

just like proper english gentleman
i be proud of they

they be boy
and they be indian

hm
will you take this off
he touch the bandage
on he cheek
it pinch every time i speak

here you see
even the south african
paper apologize a monstrous
attack


of the tape as she
be about to pull it
be you sure

yes i can not talk like this

pull

Oww

mr
khan said they called you brave

if you would let i teach you to
read you could see for yourself

i could have tell they you be merely
foolish

it prove what i told you
if i have
prosecute he as everyone advised
even you they would have hated i
by showing forgiveness i ouch

there

as though continue
the argument
you see there be such a thing as
moral force and it can be
harnessed

not always
you have tell i twice
now that you be giving up the
pleasure of the flesh

i be
i be convince the holy man
be right
when you give up you
gain
the simple you life the
well

i will fast tomorrow as a penance

if you enjoy it a great deal you
must fast for two day

the london paper have arrive from
the cape sir

yes

the bad be the daily mail sir
they said the burn of pass by
mr
gandhi be the most significant
act in colonial affair since the
declaration of independence


do they
well they will find we be a
little well prepared this time
mr
gandhi will find he be on a long
hide to nothing

you would be gandhi
gandhi nod

i think you would be big

i be sorry

i i mean it be all right
it do not
matter
he suddenly step
forward and thrust
out he hand

i be i name be andrews charlie
andrews
i have come from india
i have read a great deal about you

some of it good i hope

would you care to walk

note charlies
collar
you be a clergyman

yes
i have i have meet some very
remarkable people in india
and
and when i read what you have be
do here i i wanted to help
he look at gandhi
then smile awkwardly

do that surprise you

not anymore
and now he smile

at first i be amaze
but when
you be fighting in a just because
people seem to pop up like you
right out of the pavement
even when
it be dangerous or

hey look what be comino

white shepherd leading a brown
sammy

perhaps i should

do not the new testament say if
you enemy strike you on the right
cheek offer he the left

i think perhaps the phrase be used
metaphorically
i do not think we
lord mean

i be not so certain
i have think
about it a great deal
i suspect he
mean you must show courage be
will to take a blow several
blow to show you will not strike
back nor will you be turn
aside
and when

and when you do that it call
upon something in human nature
something that make he hate for
you diminish and he respect increase
i think christ grasp that and i
i have see it work

good morning

Nuthing
nuthing

that be lucky

i think you be a man of god

wittily but making
he point
i be
but i be not so egotistical as
to think he plan he day around i
dilemma

you could call it a communal
farm i suppose
but we have all come
to the same conclusion we gita
the muslim koran or you bible
it be always the simple thing that
catch you breath love thou
neighbor as thyself
he smile think
back at the youth

not always practice but it be
something we hindu could learn a
lot from

that be the sort of thing you will be
seeking on this farm

well we shall try

they be going to change the pass
law

it be taken time but it needed to be
do fairly
we do not want to create
an injustice simply because mr
gandhi
be abuse we exist legislation

just one second sir please

but on a short trip i would not spend
too much time on the indian question
mr
walker
it be a tiny factor in
south african life

it be news at the moment
i will
certainly report on you mine and
the economy but i would like to
meet this mr
gandhi

of course
we westerner have a
weakness for these these
spiritually incline man of india
but as an old lawyer let i warn
you mr
gandhi be as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet however
otherworldly he may seem
but i be
sure you be enough of a reporter to
see that

so it be not spiritualism or
nationalism we be not against
anything but the idea that people
can not live together

you see hindu muslim sikh
jew even christian

we will not strike a blow but we
will receive they

injustice
and it will hurt as all fight

what the hell be we suppose to do
now

watch the
procession narrowly
let they march
in we own sweet
time in we own sweet way we will
get they

some of you may be rejoicing that
mr
gandhi have at last be put into
prison

but i would ask you assemble
here in this house of god to
recognize that we be witnessing
something new something so
unexpected so unusual that it be
not surprising the government be at
a loss
what mr
gandhi have forced
we to do be ask question about
ourselves

as christian those be difficult
question to answer
how do we treat
man who defy an unjust law man
who will not fight but will not
comply

they be spare no one i see

no
you be the surprise
it be be
all over the prison
we think they would
be too afraid of the english press

so do i

do not worry about the meat it be
hindu
refer to the
soup
there be not a trace

i do not know who they have left out
there to do the work
there can not be
one mine left open
have they touched
the woman

i wife publicly defy the law
they have arrested she and four other

the fool
he spill some soup

sorry

it be split the government

well that be one victory

if we hold firm it will not be the
last

do not worry i have never see man
so determined
you have given they a
way to fight
and i do not think

gandhi
i want gandhi
which sammy
be it

ah mr
gandhi
i think we might
have a little talk

will you have a glass of sherry

thank you
no

perhaps some tea

i dine at the prison

ahh

please please do come and sit
down
it be prison i wanted to talk
to you about

mr
gandhi i have more or less decided
to ask the house to repeal the act
that you have taken such exception
to

well if you ask general smuts i be
sure it will be do

hm
of course it be not quite that
simple

somehow i expect not

i be glad to hear you say that
very glad
you see if we repeal the
act under pressure
a nod at the paper
again
under this kind of pressure it will
create a great deal of resentment
can you understand that

very well

good
good
the bland politician
the compromise

i have think of calling for a royal
commission to investigate the new
legislation
he gesture imply
they will do what
they be tell

i think i could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repeal

i congratulate they

but they might also recommend that
future indian immigration be severely
restricted even stopped

immigration be not an issue on which
we fight
it would be wrong of we
to make it one now that we we be
in a position of advantage

you be an extraordinary man

he grin
he brush
at he prison garb
i assure you i feel a very ordinary
man at this moment

i be ordering the release of all
prisoner within the next twenty
four hour
you yourself be free
from this moment

assume we be in agreement

yes yes
it be just that
in
these clothes i would i would prefer to
go by taxi

confuse by his
hesitation
all right

he waistcoat pocket
and realize he have
no money

he reach forth and
touch a buzzer

i be awfully sorry

gandhi

experience

muslim league and mr
prakash who i
fear be awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder

i have not actually pull a trigger
mr
gandhi i have simply written
that if an englishman kill an indian
for disobey he law then it be
an indian duty to kill an englishman
for enforce he law in a land that
be not his

it be a clever argument
i be not
sure it will produce the end you
desire

we hope you intend to join we in the
struggle for home rule mr
gandhi

i

be over
and those of we who supported
it and those of we who refused must
forget we difference

and there can be no excuse from the
british now
india want home rule
india demand home rule

and let no one question that mr
jinnah speak not just for the muslim
but for all india

and now i be going to introduce to
you a man whose writing we be all
becoming familiar with
a man who
stand high in the esteem of we
beloved professor Gokhale
a man
whose accomplishment in south africa
will always be remember
mr
mohandas gandhi

you journal have make a great impact

i be flattered by mr
patel
he grin

i would be even more flatter if
what he said be true

loudly
he be away
from the mike
but it be true
i i read it
often

since i return from south africa
i have travele over much of india
and i know i could travel many more
year and still only see a small
part of it

and yet already i know what we
say here mean nothing to the mass
of we country

here we make speech for each other
and those english liberal magazine
that may grant we a few line

but the people of india be untouched
they politics be confined to bread
and salt

illiterate they may be but they be
not blind
they see no reason to
give they loyalty to rich and
powerful man who simply want to take
over the role of the british in the
name of freedom

this congress tell the world it
represent india
i brother india
be seven hundred thousand village
not a few hundred lawyer in delhi
and bombay
until we stand in the
field with the millions who toil
each day under the hot sun we will
not represent india nor will we
ever be able to challenge the british
as one nation

have you read he magazine

no but i think i be going to

this can not be the way

yes i be sure this be the direction
india be taking

to think i almost get excite by mr
jinnah when all this be awaiting
i

we be looking for mr
gandhi

ah you will find he under the tree
by the river
he point off then
glance at the car

you would well leave the car the
ground be rather soft

thank you



drolly as he climb
out
come on
i be anxious to meet this
new force

i try to live like an indian as you
see
it be stupid of course because
in we country it be the british who
decide how an indian live what
he may buy what he may sell
and
from they luxury in the midst of
we terrible poverty they instruct
we on what be justice and what be
sedition
he look at they a
teasing but mordant
grin

so it be only natural that we good
young mind assume an air of eastern
dignity while greedily assimilate
every western weakness as quickly as
they can acquire it

if we have home rule that will change

would you please

and why should the english grant we
home rule
here we must take the
peeling to the goat

we only make wild speech or perform
even wild act of terrorism
we have
breed an army of anarchist but not
one single group that can really
fight the british anywhere

i think you be against fight

just spread it around they like
the new peeling mixed with the
rot one

where there be injustice i have always
believe in fight
he look at nehru

the question be do you fight to change
thing or do you fight to punish
he smile

for myself i have find that we be
all such sinner we should leave
punishment to god
and if we really
want to change thing there be good
way of do it than by derailing
train or slash someone with a
sword

the fire be ready

you see even here we live under
tyranny

i told you

hm
but look at he
some fighter
i can see the british shake now

but it be the ink that be the most
diffic

i be looking for mr
gandhi

i have wanted to speak to you for a
long time

we crop
we can not sell they
we have no money
but the landlord

arrest if you would prefer

on what charge

i do not want any trouble

i be an indian travel in i own

well there would well not be

for year the landlord have ordered
we to grow indigo for dyeing the
cloth
always they take part of the
crop as rent

but now the english factory make

mohan

in a tone of
defensiveness
if i want to be one with they i
have to live like they

i think you do
smile

but i thank god we all do not

i be sure you leg be quite as
handsome as mine

ah but i puritanism run the another
way

display

we most by taking that assignment
you have be offered in fiji

i have to be sure they have to be
sure that what we do can be do
by indian
alone

but you know the strategy
the world
be full of people who will despise
what be happening here
it be they
strength we need
before you go you
could start we in the right direction

i must leave from calcutta and soon
you will have to say goodbye to ba for
i

when i get the chance

well i

Gandhiji
Gandhiji
mr
gandhi

he accent be as
refined as he clothes
Gandhiji we be from bihar
we
received a cable this morning from
an old friend who be at cambridge
with we
smile

he name be nehru and i believe you
know he

indeed

he tell we you need help
and we
have come to give it

i want to document coldly
rationally what be be do here
it may take month many many
month

they be eager
impress
we have no press engagement

you will have to live with the
peasant
they nod

i have nothing to pay you
they only smile

hmm

i do not know what this country be
coming to

but good god man you yourself raised
the rent simply to finance a hunt
expedition

and some of these other
he gesture to the
folder again
beating illegal seizure demanding
service without pay even refuse
they water
in india

nobody know what it be to try to
get these people to work

well you have make this halfnaked
whateverheis into an international
hero

one lone man marching dusty road
armed only with honesty and a bamboo
shaft do battle with the british
empire

he lower the paper
dismally
then the
ultimate bitterness
at home child be writing essay
about he

i could not take another two year of
he to save i life

what do they want

reading precisely
from a document
rebate on rent paid
sir george huff

they be to be free to grow crop of
they own choice
commission
part indian to hear grievance

that would satisfy he

a nod
then pointedly
and he Majestys government
it
only need you signature for the
landlord

it will be worth it to see the back
of he
flourish at the
end of he signature
then he stand

we be too damn liberal

perhaps
but at least all this have
make the government see some sense
about what man like mr
gandhi should
be allow and what they should be
denied

thing be going to change

where be mr
gandhi

he said he preferred to walk sir
i
follow he most of the way
he be
just turned the corner

the prophet give i patience

he come third class

i house be honore

the honor be ours
may i introduce
mr
Kallenbach
he be an old friend
anticipate Jinnahs
objection
and he interest be in flower
i
presume to tell he he could wander
you garden while we talk

the suave but
slightly ironic host
i will send i gardener
i be sure you will
have much to discuss

gentleman the hero of champaran

only the stubborn man of champaran

mr
patel you know
patel bow

mr
maulana azad a fellow muslim
recently released from prison

mr
Kripalani
bow we have
see he at the
congress conference

and of course you know mr
nehru

a play on Jinnahs
introduction
i be beginning to know mr
nehru

to business
gandhi
have be admitted to
the power circle he
be not the power
well i have called you here because
i have have a chance to see the new
legislation
it be exactly what be
rumored
arrest without warrant
automatic imprisonment for possession
of material considered seditious

you writing be specifically listed

so much for helping they in the great
war

there be only one answer to that
direct action on a scale they can
never handle

i do not think so

terrorism would only justify they
repression
and what kind of leader
would it throw up
be they likely
to be the man we would want at the
head of we country

i have be catching up on i read

i too have read mr
Gandhis writing
but i would rather be ruled by an indian
terrorist than an english one
and i
do not want to submit to that kind of
law

to nehru
diplomatically
but with a trace of
condescension
i must say Panditji it seem to i
it be go beyond remedy like passive
resistance

if i may i for one have never
advocate passive anything

i be with mr
jinnah
we must never
submit to such law ever
and i
think we resistance must be active
and provocative

i want to embarrass all those who
wish to treat we as slave
all of
they

forgive i stupid illustration
but
i want to change they mind not
kill they for weakness we all
possess

and what resistance would you offer

the law be due to take effect from
april sixth
i want to call on the
nation to make that a day of prayer
and fasting

you mean a general strike

i mean a day of prayer and fast
but of course no work could be do
no bus no train no factory
no administration
the country would
stop

i god it would terrify they

three hundred fifty million people
at prayer
even the english newspaper
would have to report that
and explain
why

but could we get people to do it

he be half sell
already
champaran stir the whole country
they be calling you mahatma the
great soul

fortunately such news come very
slowly where i live

continuing to the
other
i think if we all worked to publicize
it
all of the congress
every
avenue we know

perhaps i should have stay in the
garden and talk about the flower

sir it be mr
Kinnoch

yes

nothing
nothing be working sir
bus
train
the market
there be not even any civilian staff
here sir
everything have stopped

be it simply delhi and bombay

no sir karachi calcutta madras
bangalore
it be it be total

the army have to take over the
telegraph or we would be cut off from
the world

i can not believe it

he be going to sell he own paper
tomorrow in bombay
they have called
for a parade on victoria road

clench he jaw and
turn to the general
arrest he

Bapu

you too

a real smile but
the same affection
it seem less formal than mahatma


since you arrest the riot have
hardly stopped
not big
but they
keep breaking out
i run to stop
they
and patel and Kripalani
they be never at rest
but some
english civilian have be killed
and the army be attack crowd
with club and sometimes bad

maybe i be wrong
maybe we be not
ready yet
in south africa the number
be small

the government afraid and they
do not know what to do
but they be
more afraid of terrorist than of
you
the viceroy have agreed to you
release if you will speak for non
violence

i have never spoken for anything else

england be so powerful it
army and it navy all it modern
weapon but when a great power
like that strike defenseless people
it show it brutality it own
weakness
especially when those people
do not strike back
he hold aloft the
clench journal

that be why the mahatma beg we to
take the course of nonviolence

if we riot if we fight back we
become the vandal and they become
the law
if we bear they blow
they be the vandal god and he
law be on we
he glance up

side

we must have the courage to take
they anger

port arm sergeant major

load

almost to himself as
he too be riveted
we pain will be we victory

do we issue a warn sir

they have have they warn no
meeting

sergeant major

take aim

fire

reload

take you time
take you time

corporal

sir

over there

sir


general dyer be it correct that you
ordered you troop to fire at the
thick part of the crowd

that be so

one thousand five hundred and sixteen
casualty with one thousand six
hundred and fifty bullet

i intention be to inflict a lesson
that would have an impact throughout
all india

general have you be able to take
in the armored car would you have
opened fire with the machine gun

i think probably yes

general do you realize there be
child and woman in the crowd

i do

but that be irrelevant to the point
you be making

that be correct

could i ask you what provision you
make for the wound

i be ready to help any who applied

general
how do a child shot
with a enfield apply for
help


you must understand gentleman that
he Majestys government and the
british people repudiate both the
massacre and the philosophy that
prompt it

what i would like to do be to come
to some compromise over the new civil
legis

if you will excuse i you
excellency it be we view that
matter have go beyond
legislation


we think it be time you recognized
that you be master in someone else
home
it chill stiffen
gandhi proceed only
an iota soft
despite the good intention of the
good of you you must in the nature
of thing humiliate we to control
we
general dyer be but an extreme
example of the principle
it be time
you left

with respect mr
gandhi without
british administration this country
would be reduced to chaos

mr
Kinnoch i beg you to accept
that there be no people on earth who
would not prefer they own bad
government to the good government
of an alien power

i dear sir india be british
we be hardly an alien power

even if he majesty could waive all
other consideration he have a duty
to the millions of he muslim subject
who be a minority in this realm
and experience have taught that he
troop and he administration be
essential in order to keep the peace

all nation contain religious
minority
like other country
ours will have it problem
but they will be ours not yours

and how do you propose to make they
yours
you do not think we be just
going to walk out of india

yes
in the end you will walk out
because one hundred thousand
englishman simply cannot control
three hundred fifty million indian
if the indian refuse to cooperate
and that be what we intend to achieve
peaceful nonviolent nonco
operation

until you yourself see the wisdom of
leaving
you excellency

mocking he exchange
with gandhi
you do not just expect we to walk
out
yes


extraordinary little man
nonviolent
noncooperation for a moment i
almost think they be actually
going to do something

yes but it would be wise to be
very cautious for a time
the anti
terrorist act will remain on the
statute but on no account be gandhi
to be arrested
whatever mischief he
cause i have no intention of making
a martyr of he

but now something badly be
happening
when Gandhiji and i be
growing up woman weave they own
cloth
but now there be millions
who have no work because those who
can buy all they need from england
i say with Gandhiji there be no
beauty in the fine cloth if it
make hunger and unhappiness

i message tonight be the message i
have given to you brother
everywhere
to gain independence we
must prove worthy of it

there must be HinduMuslim unity
always
second finger

secondly no indian must be treated
as the english treat we so we must
remove untouchability from we live
and from we heart

third we must defy the british

not with violence that will inflame
they will but with firmness that
will open they eye

english factory make the cloth
that make we poverty
reaction

all those who wish to make the english
see bring i the cloth from
manchester and leeds that you wear
tonight and we will light a fire
that will be see in delhi and
london

and if like i you be left with
only one piece of homespun wear
it with dignity

excuse i just let i get out of
you way please
someone reach for
he bedroll and bag

no thank you i will manage

joyous it be be
a long time
ah herman
no no do not destroy i good
intention
i be feeling guilty about
travel second class

i do it as a friend and admirer
not a servant

ah in that case

maulana be make of sterne stuff
we train meet in bombay but he be
back there in that lot somewhere

there he be out Gandhiing gandhi

shaking he head at
it all
when i think what we beloved
mahatma ask i do not know how he
ever get such a hold over we
be he
back

yes
now that thing be moving he be
going to write and only take part
when it be necessary

it be a hindu child and it tried to
wet on i

of course
muslim beef eater
i be only surprise he missed

he be a she

ah that explain it
he grin

well do i carry you luggage as
penance or

there be another passenger a miss
slade
he turn
automatically as
patel and azad do
toward the first
class section

she be the daughter of an english
admiral
patel and azad look
back at he in quick
surprise
Kallenbach
smile

she be be corresponding with he
for a year

and what do the daughter of an
english admiral propose to do in an
ashram sink we

from the look of the luggage yes

she want to make she home with we
and Gandhiji have agreed

you would be mr
Kallenbach

and you would be miss slade

i prefer the name Gandhiji have given
i Mirabehn

it be a gift and it only worked a
few week but when gandhi come home
he strike on this idea
he call it
he oxford
comfortable and yet
more we pace

might mr
nehru be there too

the irresponsible young nehru be in
prison again
though there be a
rumor that under pressure from you
country they will let he out
again

you can not know how closely we follow
you struggle
how many in england admire what you
do in bardoli
it must have taken
enormous courage

well in this country one must decide
if one be more afraid of the
government or gandhi
of azad Kallenbach
and himself
for we it be gandhi

and you be german

yes

and do you feel indian

no

but you have be with he so long
why

i would come to believe i would never
meet a truly honest man
and then i
meet one

stop stop

god give you ten thumb

eleven

sardar

what you have do be a miracle
you
have make all india proud

it must have be the only nonviolent
campaign ever lead by a man who wanted
to kill everybody every day

not true
he mean himself

the secret be master the urge

he come second class

well we can not expect miracle all
the time
then to azad more
soberly
you news i understand be not so
good

no

come come you will be i
daughter

but then some rioting broke out
between hindu and muslim violent
terrible

whether it be provoke
he shrug a hint of
suspicion
but it give they an excuse to impose
martial law throughout bengal
he look at gandhi
shaking he head
grimly

some of the thing the military have
do

be the campaign weakening

the march and protest be big
if anything but with the censorship
here
they know more in england than we
do and it sap the courage to think
you may be suffering alone

they be not alone
and martial law
only show how desperate the british
be

be that homespun
or cotton from
leeds

i i send for it from here
i
dyed it myself

what do the worker in england make
of what we be do
it must have
produced hardship

it have
but you would be surprise
they
understand they really do
it be
not the worker you have to worry
about

good
glance toward ba

ba will have to teach you to spin
too

i would rather march

first spin
let the other march for
a time

first lesson
to march wear shoe
to spin do not

i will teach you all we foolishness
and you must teach i yours

as they try to scramble
away from the attack
out of shot we
can still hear the disappearing chant

hey

that be one bit of news they have not
censored

oh it be all over the world

we must end the campaign

after what they do at the massacre
it be only an eye for an eye

he have not moved
the
same tone
an eye for an eye only end up making
the whole world blind
now he look up at
they

we must stop

Gandhiji do you know the sacrifice
people have make

we would never get the same commitment
again ever

if we obtain we freedom by murder
and bloodshed i want no part of it

it be one incident

tell that to the family of the
policeman who die

Bapu the whole nation be marching
they would not stop even if we ask
they to

i will ask
and i will fast as penance
for i part in arouse such emotion
and i will not stop until they stop

god
you can be sure the british
will not censor that
they will put it on
every street corner

but but Gandhiji people be
aroused
they will not stop

if i die perhaps they will

i must get ready for evening prayer
Mirabehn be here

i have bring you drink water
may i turn you

there be a little lemon juice in it
that be all

herman have go to meet pandit nehru

everywhere it have stopped

when it be everywhere then i prayer
will be answer

do you find i stubborn

i do not know
i know you be right
i do not know that this be right

when i despair i remember that all
through history the way of truth and
love have always win

there have be tyrant and murderer
and for a time they can seem
invincible
but in the end they always
fall
think of it always
when
you be in doubt that that be god
way the way the world be mean to
be
think of that

and then try to do it he way
tear run down
Mirabehns face
she
touch he shoulder
gandhi just lean
he head back in
exhaustion

and now could i have another feast
of lemon juice

Panditji come in

called for the end of nonco
operation
there be not be one
demonstration
all over india people
be praying that you will end the
fast
they be walking in the street

and to british soldier

perhaps perhaps i have overdone
it

again

and now he smile
gandhi to nehru
special
i know india be not ready for i
kind of independence
if i be send
to jail perhaps that be the good
protest we country can make at this
time
and if it help india i have
never refuse to take he Majestys
hospitality

call the prisoner to the bar

Noncooperation have one aim
the overthrow of the government
sedition must become we creed
we
must give no quarter nor can we
expect any

he look up at gandhi

sign

gandhi in you journal
young india dated twentysecond
march of this year
do you deny
writing it

not at all
and i will save the court time
MLord by state under oath that
to this day i believe noncooperation
with evil be a duty
and that british
rule of india be evil

the prosecution rest MLord

i take it you will conduct you own
defense mr
gandhi

i have no defense i lord
i be
guilty as charged
and if you truly believe in the system
of law you administer in i country
you must inflict on i the severe
penalty possible

it be impossible for i to ignore
that you be in a different category
from any person i have ever tried
or be likely to try

it be nevertheless i duty to sentence
you to six year imprisonment

a personal statement
not a real hope
if however he Majestys government
could at some late date see
fit to reduce that term no one would
be well please than i

yes i be sure that be exactly what
they hope
put he in prison a few
year and with luck he would be forgotten
and maybe they would even subdue he

well he certainly be not forgotten
and as soon as he get out he be
back tramp the country preach
nonviolence and demanding a free
india
everybody know another
showdown coming but when and
over what

well i read you account of that
crowd in calcutta and that he be
twist the lion tail again

and i know something have to give
and i be determined to be here when
it do

how do a reporter in central america
learn that gandhi be born in
Porbandar anyway

oh i have be a gandhi buff for a
long time

he certainly make good copy
laugh

the other day winston churchill called
he that halfnaked indian fakir


i meet he once

you mean gandhi

back in south africa
long time ago

what be he like

college freshman trying to figure
everything out

well he must have find some of the
answer

in every worthy wish of yours i
shall be you helpmate


take a fourth step that we may be
ever full of joy

and duty


take the seventh step that we may
ever live as friend


you be i good friend
i high
guru and i sovereign lord


then i put a sweeten wheat cake in
she mouth

and i put a sweeten wheat cake in
he mouth

and with that we be pronounced man
and wife
we be both thirteen

it be beautiful

even as a boy i think so

trying to keep track of you be making
i change all i sleep habit

and you have come all this way because
you think something be going to
happen

hm
be it

perhaps
i have come here to think
about it

do you remember much of south africa

great deal

i have travele so far and think
so much
he smile in self
mockery and turn
toward the city

as you can see i city be a sea
city always filled with hindu
and muslim and sikh and jew and
persian
he look at walker

the temple where you be yesterday
be of i family sect the Pranami
it be hindu of course but the priest
used to read from the muslim koran
and the hindu gita moving from one
to the other as though it matter
not at all which book be read as
long as god be worship

when i be a boy i used to sing a
song in that temple
true disciple
know another woe as he own
he
bow to all and despise none
earthly possession hold he not

like all boy i said the word not
think of what they mean or how
they might be influence i
he look at walker
then out to the sea
again shaking he
head

i have travele so far
and all i have
do be come back home

you know what you be going to do

it would have be very uncivil of
i to let you make such a long trip
for nothing

where be you going

i be going back to the ashram
and then i be going to prove to the
new viceroy that the kings writ no
longer run in india

salt

yes sir
he be going to march to
the sea and make salt

there be a royal monopoly on the
manufacture of salt sir
it be illegal
to make it or sell it without a
government license

all right he be breaking the law
what will he be deprive we of two
rupee of salt tax

it be not a serious attack on the
revenue sir
it primary importance
be symbolic

do not patronize i charles

no sir
i in this climate sir
nothing life without water or
salt
we absolute control of it be
a control on the pulse of india

and that be the basis of this
declaration of independence

yes sir
the day he set off everyone
be suppose to raise the flag of
free india
then he walk some two
hundred and forty mile to the sea
and make salt

i say ignore it
let they raise they
damn flag let he make he salt
it be only symbolic if we choose to
make it so

he be going to arrive at the sea on
the anniversary of the massacre at
amritsar

general edgar be right ignore it
mr
gandhi will find it be going to
take a great deal more than a pinch
of salt to bring down the british
empire

the real test will come if i be
arrested
if there be violence we
lose all we moral advantage
this
time it must not happen

we be not beginner anymore
we have
be trained by a strict sergeant
major

if i be taken maulana be to lead the
march
if he be arrested patel
then Kripalani then yourself

you should be relax

i be sure i be fit for at least five
hundred mile

you should ride the pony
it be not
necessary to walk to prove the point

i have two of they boss i now

we must get these to the printer
he look down at
gandhi

i know it will succeed
even i mother
be prepare to march

and jinnah

he be waiting
he be not prepare to
accept it will mean as much as you
think

wait and see
wait and see

you have do i a great service

a grin then a play
on Gandhis word to
he
it would have be uncivil of i to
have let you make such a long trip
for nothing

be it over if they arrest you now

not if they arrest i or a thousand
or ten thousand
he look at walker

it be not only general who know how
to plan campaign

what if they do not arrest you
what
if they do not react at all

do you still have you notebook
walker fumble for
it
gandhi go right
on talking

the function of a civil resister be
to provoke response
and we will
continue to provoke until they
respond or they change the law
they be not in control we be
that be the strength of civil
resistance

Whatd he say

he said he be in charge

be you going to walk all the way

i name be walker
and i intend to
report it the way it be

i name be walker

we have come to join the march
what
do we do

be sure you be awake in the morning
it come from a
knowledge of student
he smile and nod
off

find a place to sleep

man need salt as he need air and
water
this salt come from the indian
ocean
the salt crystal
be added to an urn
already partially
full
the camera
pull back and gandhi
lift the urn
all
around he the
press crowd
newsreel cameraman
reporter walker
collins naidu
Pyarelal
firmly
let every indian claim it as his
right

and so once more the man of non
violence have challenged the might of
the british empire

they be making it everywhere sir
mob of they publicly
congress
leader be selling it on the street
of delhi

we be be make fool of around the
world

be not there any instruction from
london

we be required to stop it
he stand he mind
make up

and stop it we will
he look at the senior
police officer

i do not care if we fill the jail
stop it
arrest anyone any rank
except gandhi
we will cut he strength
from under he
and then we will deal
with the mahatma

oh i god

right jump to it clear this
beach

no violence zia

repeating quietly
as though to zia
no violence

you be nehru

i be an illegal trader in salt

there be be no time to keep
figure but there must be ninety
a hundred thousand under arrest
and it still go on

who be leading they

i do not know
nehru patel almost
every congress official be in jail
and they wife and they child
we have even arrested Nehrus mother

have there be any violence

oh in karachi the police fired on a
crowd and killed a couple of people
and
and in peshawar the deputy police
commissioner lost he head and
and opened fire with a machine gun
he look up at they
quickly defensively

but he be facing a disciplinary court
you can not expect thing like that
not to happen when

i believe the question be intended
to discover if there be any violence
of they side

oh no sir no i be afraid not

again the
machiavellian mind
perhaps if we arrest gandhi it
might

to senior police
officer
he be addressed this letter directly
to you have he

yes sir he have
the usual Indias
salt belong to india but then he
say flatly that he personally be
going to lead a raid tomorrow on the
Dharasana salt work

thank he for he letter and put
he in jail

yes sir
yes sir
it will be i
pleasure

and field keep that salt works
open

yes sir

i would like admission to the works

i be sorry sir
that cannot be
allow

last night they take Gandhiji from
we
they expect we to lose heart or
to fight back
we will not lose heart
we will not fight back
in he name
we will be beaten
as he have taught
we we will not raise a hand
long
live mahatma gandhi


now

hello
ed
ed
goddammit do not cut
i off
then suddenly he be
through

ed
okay yeah right

they walk with head up without
music or cheer or any hope of
escape from injury or death

he voice be taut
harshly professional

it go on and on and on
woman
carry the wound body from the
ditch until they drop from
exhaustion
but still it go on


whatever moral ascendance the west
hold be lost today
india be free
for she have taken all that steel and
cruelty can give and she have neither
cringe nor retreat

on walker close
he
sweat blood and
dirtstained face
near tear

in the word of he follower long
live mahatma gandhi


i be aware that i must have given
you much because for irritation you
excellency
i hope it will not stand
between we as man

mr
gandhi i have instruction to
request you attendance at an all
government conference in london to
discuss to discuss the possible
independence of india

i think we first duty be to recognize
that there be not one india but
several
a hindu india a muslim
india and india of princely state
and all these must be respected
and care for not just one

do i speak into that

be they ready
do i start

i be glad to speak to america where
so many friend exist that i know
only in i heart

i think you interest and the world
have fallen on india not only because
we be struggling for freedom but
because the way we be do so be
unique as far as history show we
here in europe mighty nation be
it seem already contemplate
another war though i think they
and all the world be sick to death
of bloodspilling
all of we be
seeking a way out and i flatter
myself that perhaps the ancient land
of india will offer such a way
if
we be to make progress we must not
repeat history but make history
and i myself will die before i betray
we belief that love be a strong
weapon than hate

it be only a sprain
take she to the
river and we will make a mudpack for
she
go i will not be long

so the truth be after all you
travel all you effort they have
stopped the campaign and send you
home emptyhanded

they be only clinging to old dream
look up from his
spinning to jinnah
and trying to split we in the old
way
but the will have go
independence will drop like a ripe
apple
the only question be when
another glance at
jinnah
and how

i say when be now and we will
determine how

precisely

they be preparing for war
i will
not support it but i do not intend
to take advantage of they danger

blithely but to the
point
that be when you take advantage

no
that be just another way of
striking back
we have come a long
way together with the british
when
they leave we want to see they off
as friend
he start down the
step and head for
the river

and now if you will excuse i there
be something i must attend to

mud pack


mr
gandhi sir

i have instruction to inquire as to
the subject of you speech tonight

the value of goat milk in daily
diet
but you can be sure i will also speak
against war

i be sorry sir
that can not be allow

it be all right mrs
gandhi
i have
order to return with you and you
companion to the Mahatmas ashram

if you take i husband i intend to
speak in he place

stop
wait a minute

it be the aga khans palace but
they have turn it into a prison

shouting over the
motor
they have get most of the lead
congress politician in this one
but nehru and some other be over
in dehra dun
you time pretty
lucky
they have you mr
gandhi cut
off from the press but last month
he personal secretary die and
they have let up on the restriction

yes i have hear of life magazine
smile

i have even hear of margaret bourke
white
but i do not know why either
should be interest in an old man
sitting in prison when the world be
blowing itself to piece

a beat and she
smile
you be the only man i know who make
he own clothes

ah but for i that be not much of an
accomplishment

no prison be rather agreeable to
i and there be no doubt that after
the war independence will come
i
only worry be what shape it will
take
jinnah have

stop

now go on just as you be


what shape it will take
jinnah
have what

at first disconcert
but then flow
jinnah have have cooperate with
the british
it have given he power
and the freedom to speak and he have
filled the muslim with fear of
what will happen to they in a country
that be predominantly hindu
he stop lowering
he head gravely

that i find hard to bear even in
prison

archly but
emphatically of the
spin
i do not see it as the solution of
the twentieth century problem

i have a friend who keep telling i
how much it cost he to keep i in
poverty

but i know happiness do not come
with thing even twentieth century
thing
it can come from work and
pride in what you do
he look at she
steadily

it will not necessarily be progress
for india if she simply import the
unhappiness of the west

but do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against someone
like hitler

not without defeat and great
pain
he look at she

but be there no defeat in this war
no pain
for a moment the
thought hang and
then gandhi take
they hand back to
the spinning

what you cannot do be accept
injustice
from hitler or anyone
you must make the injustice visible
be prepared to die like a soldier to
do so

be i finger suppose to be wrapped
around that

no
that be what you get for
distracting i

what do you expect when you talk
like that

trying to unravel
the mess
i expect you to show as much patience
as i be now

every enemy be a human being even
the bad of they
and he believe
he be right and you be a beast
and now a little
smile

and if you beat he over the head
you will only convince he
but you
suffer to show he that he be wrong
you sacrifice create an atmosphere
of understand if not with he
then in the heart of the rest of
the community on whom he depend

if you be right you will win
after much pain
he look at she
then smile in his
own ironic way

if you be wrong well then only
you will suffer the blow

not at all
Bapu have always say
there be two kind of slavery in
india one for woman one for the
untouchable and he have always
fight against both

do it rankle be separated from
he this way

yes
but we see each other in the
day

but not at night

in hindu philosophy the way to god
be to free yourself of possession
and the passion that inflame to
anger and jealousy
smile

Bapu have always struggle to find
the way to god

you mean he he give up
how to phrase it
finally
marry life

four time he tried and failed
Mirabehn and bourke

the word of the lord be love thou
neighbor as thyself
and then we
beloved gita which say the world
be a garment worn by god thou neighbor
be in truth thyself
and finally
the holy koran we shall remove all
hatred from we heart and recline
on couch face to face a band of

that you cannot do by dying

what do you want

that the fight will stop that

start again

sometimes it be when you be quite
without hope and in utter darkness
that god come to the rescue

away you revenge
what will be
gain by more kill

courage to do what you know be right

of they flirtation
i be simply going to prove to muslim
there and hindu here that the
only devil in the world be those
running around in we own heart
and that be where all we battle
ought to be fight

and what kind of a warrior have you
be in that warfare

not a very good one
that be why i
have so much tolerance for the other
scoundrel of the world

ask Panditji to to consider what
we have discuss

enough

one more

you be a temptress

just an admirer

nothing more dangerous especially
for an old man

there be a sadness in he

he think he be failed

why
i god if anything prove
he right it be what be happen these
last month

i be blinded by i love of he but
i think when we most needed it he
offered the world a way out of
madness
but he do not see it
and neither do the world

allah be with you

brother Bapu be already late for
prayer

oh god
oh god

Bapu
Bapu

weak struggling as
he speak the word
to Mirabehn
there have be tyrant and
murderer and for a time they can
seem invincible
but in the end they
always fall
think of it always
when you be in doubt that that be
god way the way the world be mean
to be
think of that
