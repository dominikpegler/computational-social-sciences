the door of alcala have also darken



mateo say something

mateo be dead

do not say that


i always wanted to be another person to be someone
beside myself
to dispose of a single identity do not
seem enough
living a single life be not enough for
i
and halfjoking i come up with a pseudonym for
myself harry caine an adventurer who as fate would
have it become a writer
at that time i have he
author all the script and story that i write
i
come up with a standard biography to fill the back
flap of he book
he have be a sailor an
industrial spy the doorman at a parisian cabaret a
boxer a waiter and an advertisement handdouble

selfmade man active and attractive like an english
spy vital skeptical and sarcastic
for many year
mateo blanco and harry caine shared the same person
i but a time come when all of a sudden i could not
be anyone other than harry caine
i become i
pseudonym
he apply lotion in front of the mirror
we first see he in front of it and then double
reflected in it
then suddenly the mirror do not
reflect he
of he two identity he only have one
left
just as i have planned a heterodox writer and
never well stated a selfmade man one might even
say selfwritten man
there be only one detail i
have not foresee harry would be a blind writer

person who help you across the street
one of these
day something awful will happen to you

everything awful that be have to
happen to i have
now all that be left be for i to
enjoy life



diego told i yesterday that you finished the script

i would like to add a final epilogue
it may not be
necessary but i would like to write it

i agreed to deliver the definitive version to the
producer and director today

you will have it by tomorrow do not worry


ernesto martel have die

i think he be very i will

it be be so long since we have spoken of he


you look awful

i run here

and it be monday
diego you do not have to run for i
we be not in a hurry

i be i have committed

you will have it by tonight do not worry

start think of the next script
some kind of
horror or fantasy story for bratty teenager
it be
what sell best

i do not know if i will know how to
i be think of
developing a story inspired by arthur miller son

the writer who married marilyn


yes
after marilyn he married the photographer inge
morat and they have a son
he be born mentally
handicap and arthur miller hide he
he do not even
mention he in he memoir
he never recognized he
publicly
from the moment he be born he have he
place in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of
he
despite he condition the boy be able to learn
and to make an almost normal life for himself
he
live in an apartment with other friend and he find
a job as a clerk in a supermarket

and miller never see he


one day miller be
giving a conference in defense of a mentally retard
man who have be condemned to death after what be
believe to be a force confession
among those
present be he mentally handicap son who be
integrally involved with organization that aid all
sort of disable people
the son be very proud to
finally be sharing something with he father
at the
end of the conference he approached the stage and
held he in an embrace that must have seem endless
to arthur miller who do not know how to extract
himself from this mentally handicap man
imagine
it would not have be politically correct least of
all given the situation in which miller find himself
then the stranger let go of he and told he
i be

you son daniel and i be very proud of you father

this be the only time father and son see each other

it be very moving but i do not think
we can write a script about arthur miller without
procure right from the family

we change the name the story be not about the
writer miserliness but about the strength of the
son who survive without the least bit of rancor
toward the father who have ignore he he entire life
it be a story of trouble overcome and of inherent
goodness
there be not those many good man that one
can write about

it be a beautiful story
but year ago when you begin
writing again and i begin selling you script you
told i you would never write remake sequel nor
biopic
nor story whose protagonist be film

director handicap or blind
i remember clearly
because the part of the biopic surprise i

i can not bear they
as if he have at that very moment
remembered it be true it be true i said all that but
this would not exactly be a biopic

i will get it

thank you

i have see all of mateo Blancos film including the
last one girl and suitcase

be that so
you must be the only one

what happen to mateo blanco


why do you ask

because he vanished from public life

it would seem that way

almost as if he would die

yes


i lost track of he some time ago

i have always be intrigued by the case of he last film

whose

mateo Blancos
the first five be stupendous
you
be the screenwriter for all of they how do you
explain that the last one be a disaster

film turn out well
or badly
the reason be always a mystery
mateo
switched genre perhaps he be not skilled for
comedy
but tell i about the story you want to
write


i would like to write a story about a sones revenge
one against the memory of he father

why do the son desire revenge

because the father ruined his
life practically nullify he while he live
the
father be a successful financier violent homophobic
very powerful and unscrupulous
he think everyone
have a price and that be how he behave with people
i
do not know if you have have the misfortune of meet
someone like this

when you say he be powerful what kind of power be
you refer to

economic with everything that entail
he be a
broker of the generation of speculator that make
quick highprofit gain in the s
he amassed a
great fortune during the oil crisis
the son be
sensitive with complex and artistic preoccupation
and live under he shadow trying to please the
father in everything
despite be a bit
homosexual the son marry twice just like the
father and just like he he separate
he have a

son that hate he just as much as he hate he own
father
when the father die the son be finally able
to rebuild he life
that be he salvation and he
revenge

i get it
i be afraid i be not the writer you be
looking for

you be you do not know how much

i will pay whatever you ask

it be too personal

make it yours
i be not aim for a biopic rather
i think of it as a base from which to develop a
fiction

thanks but no
and now if you do not mind


there you have i phone number if you change you mind

i be sure we will see each other again

in i case that would be a miracle

order than a request please look after he during
i absence

i have thing to do mom
i can not look
after he all day

it be only two week

harry manage perfectly on he own and right now we
be not writing anything

i be worry about ernesto junior visit
i would
like for you to be on guard in case he appear or
call and then let i know immediately

why be you so worry

he be crazy
i do not trust he

why


it be a long story

summarize it

diego please this be not the moment

it never be for you

hey if it bother you so much to look
after harry i will quit the job and stay in madrid
or
i will hire someone

it do not bother i to look after harry
but i be
tire of so much secrecy

do not go so fast


we be exercise

i be not
i be just keeping you company
how can you
walk so fast

i be train and i do not work at night nor do i drug
myself

what do you mean by that

that i take care of myself with the fanaticism of an
old handicap person

you be no fanatic

yes i be
all of we who survive a critical physical
injury be
there be no other way


what be you looking at

billboard

why so

in huge letter it say donate blood it include
where one have to go

you want to donate blood

no no
i be think that donate blood be a good
title for a movie

yes
it have a good ring

for a vampire flick

it be true

imagine that behind
the billboard a whole group of vampire that work in
ambulatory care be hide
and they actually keep the
blood they get from donor for they own consumption
of course

you mother would like that story


the vampire would be like a type of ethnic group
completely assimilated into spanish society they
do not stand out
there be vampire who occupy
important position keeping it a secret like the
opus dei
but even though they live in the shadow
they have amass great social and economic power

they control various industry
for example the one
responsible for dark sunglass

and those that provide nightly entertainment
bar disco afterhours
since they do not need drug
to stay awake they be the most apt for working at
night
they do not burn out


and for the sunscreen business
the poor thing be
very sensitive to climate change and to the hole in
the ozone layer
they sunscreen be some of the
best on the market

and those which sell best
this be all great

protected by the sunscreen they can function all day
the lotion must be as dense as armour

this be how the story could begin
gorgeous woman totally naked rub
she body with a superdense lotion before heading to
work at an ambulatory hospital
she body be a velvety
pale beautiful

what a great open
we also need a love
story

hybrid love story between the female vampire and a
normal guy

like in cat people a love story between being of
different species

she work at one of those lab where blood be donated
and where they snatch it for themselves
the guy have
go to donate his or to get some test
they like












no no sucking
she would tear it on the first bite

and how do he react
man may do without kiss
but it be very rough not to have you cock suck

since he be deeply in love he accept the situation
once they be more comfortable
with each other she wear a muzzle as security for
both
because when she be turn on she have a type of
dental erection she face grow into something like
that of a shewolf

i like you story very much diego

i will be you spar partner for all the time

after you disappeared ernesto senior
think only of he revenge
plan have occur to
he but to carry it out he have to bribe at the very
least both luis and i
it be not an issue we both
sold ourselves without hesitation
luis and i
with
i he have the courtesy to provide an alibi he
proposed that i leave for a month and a half to the
united states to the mayo clinic so that diego could
undergo a cure for he aspergillosis that way i
would not have to be present while he destroyed the
movie because that be he plan to make a mess out
of the film
i opt to stay in madrid and have
diego undergo he cure here
i wanted to witness
everything
if i be going to betray you i wanted to
pay the full price

what a live hell
for both of you

you said it

yes
it be torture to watch ernesto select the bad
take of each shot and luis edit they together turning
you film into a monster briefly tear

the only
way of withstand that be to suffer more

i sold myself to ernesto because of i pain
and jealousy
i could not take it and i could not
forgive you for have abandoned Cinearte with lena
without saying a word
i betrayal be i revenge
against you against she and against myself
the only
innocent one be diego
forgive i i
son for the bitterness that you have have to absorb all
these year
no one deserve to grow up like this

do not continue judit
it be not necessary

yes
now that you once again call yourself mateo i
have no excuse


no one know where you be
we have no idea
ernesto
senior put everything together the premier all that
ruckus to see if you would react
he revenge be
pointless if neither of you find out about it
ernesto ask i constantly if i know where
you be but i said that i also do not know anything
which be true

that be why i never called you but even if
you do not believe it i be very worry for you and
the boy

i believe you

ernesto hired various detective to search for you but
before they find you you called i two day after
the premier
slowly debilitated
i be too
embarrass to answer and
too stun
i still be
when ernesto senior ask i again about you i do not
know why i give he the phone number for famara


ernesto send he son to find you in lanzarote

he be the one who find you after the accident and
called the hospital

do he have something to do with the accident

no
but i can not stop think that have i not given his
father the phone number perhaps nothing would have
happen

why do you think that

i do not know

if you do not know then stop torture
yourself

it be just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of
social affair
imagine how upset the mayor would be
and i party
i party can not take one more scandal
