then we do not miss much do we




i eat mr
Kloppman i
sound strange to
say it
i be dinin with a family







actual income as well as
project income against actual
operate cost as well as
project operate cost produce
a reduce marginality of profit
which in turn

seitz
what in blaze be he talking
about

say you need to make more money
chief





of course i need to make more money
but how do i make more money you
bloodless blot

i have several proposal
the
first be to increase the paper
price

then hearst undersells i and i be
in the poorhouse
brilliant

not the customer price the
price to the distribution
apparatus
exasperated pulitzer look to seitz for a translation

you mean the Newsies
charge
the Newsies more for they paper
bad idea chief

very well
i next proposal
salary cut particularly those
at the very top

wait
what do the Newsies pay
now fifty cent per hundred
paper
if you raised it to
sixty cent

mere tenth of a cent per paper

then that multiply by forty
thousand paper a day seven day
a week well it would pay some
of the bill around here

chief if you do this every
Newsie we get will head straight
for hearst




not necessarily
as newspaperman
hearst and i would cut each other
throat to get the good of the
other
but as businessman and
gentleman we often agree on
way to keep down certain operate
cost
if i know willie hearst
he be going to wish he think of
this himself

what about the other paper

if we do it they will all do it
it be only a tenth of a cent
nobody get hurt
it be good for
the Newsies an incentive make
they work harder sell more paper
now get i hearst on that
contraption





they jack up the price
ten
cent a hunnerd i can eat two
day on ten cent


Thisll bust i i be barely
makin a livin now

i will be back sleepin on
the street





it do not make no sense
all the money pulitzer
make why would he gouge we

awright pipe down
do not you
see it be a gag
just weasel bein
a weasel
joke over Wease
give i a hunnerd

Hunnerdll cost you sixty cowboy

i be not payin no sixty

then move outta the way

you bet i move right over to
the journal

it be the same at the journal we
checked it be the same everywhere

why the jackup weasel

why not
it be a nice day
why
do not you ast mr

Nobodys going anywhere they
be not going to get away with this

what can we do etc

one thing for sure
if we do not
sell pape then nobody sell pape
