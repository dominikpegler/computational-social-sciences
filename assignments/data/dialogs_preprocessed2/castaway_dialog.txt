who be it from



i wife

i guess be we be talking fuel filter
here fernando
the gas be dirty these
jitneys get in the mountain they
engine cut out

that could lose we half an hour

easy
each way

so it finally turned up

i will catch the sweep tonight

it take this test package thirtytwo
hour to get from seattle to st
petersburg a distance of nine thousand
mile
and then it take fortyone hour
to get from we warehouse in st
petersburg to here a distance of
what

six kilometer
four mile

so how be we going to get this place
shaped up

there be only one way
we have to work
together
every one of we depend on
everyone else
if one package be late
we be all late
if one truck miss the
deadline we all miss the deadline
let we start by taking a look around

here this table be too far from the
wall
package can slip down
like
pull out a package from
behind a table
this

what could be in here
let we say one of
you send it
could be the close paper
on you dacha could be a toy for you
grandson birthday could be a kidney to
keep you mother alive
i do not think
you want you mother kidney to end up
behind a table

tonight then put in a new feeder belt
say a twentyfour incher
yes overtime

i be going out on every route i be going
to work every job here until i know
enough to help you
that be it

it be bad

badly than warsaw

nobody remember that

the failure they remember
it be the
success they forget

you sort you package before you left
none of the other driver do

he say he want to be organized
do
package in order

so how come the other driver have not
left yet

he say he be a very rude fellow

tell i exactly what he said

he say why do not he fart smell sweet

he say that be just the way it be

lev it be lev right

swim

so why be milan late colin

one of the race horse coming from
ireland get colic and have to be off
loaded in brussels

the dutiable item

stan can we get down to work with
milan custom

justify delaying product especially
at christmas

foreign

chuck thank for joining we
status

becca as you know st
petersburg be
consistently running late by six to ten
hour sometimes a full day or more
i
replace the station manager
we
identify inefficiency and worked out
a quality improvement plan i believe can
be meet

you replace the station manager with a
driver
local with no knowledge of we
system

should not you have bring in someone
from memphis
russia be priority one

james pottinger be available

he be a number cruncher
chuck do
all the right thing here

jims a terrific financial man no
question
but we can not always parachute
in from memphis
we have get to build up
we local staff

we have get to improve foreign ontime
that be what we have get to do
if this new
guy so good how come the very first
plane he send missed the connection in
paris

we be building a new team here
we get
every package on the truck for the first
time ever

i favorite doctor
what be the verdict

under the circumstance you overall
health be good
those salt water boil
you picked up on the raft be ulcerated
but they be healing nicely

Hemoglobins
you be anemic
that be why we be giving you iron
Potassiums low we be giving you an
electrolyte solution with you
Sodiums over way too high
you may
experience swelling in you extremity
as you rehydrate and discharge the salt
in spite of you dietary deficiency
there be no sign of mental deterioration

what be so funny

sorry
sorry
why do i joint still
ache

dehydration
vitamin deficiency
protein deficiency
any or all of the
above

all i eat be fish
that be solid
protein

protein digestion be very costly in water
usage

which i do not have

and fish be very low in fat which be
energy inefficient
so you be going to
burn up you own cell no matter how much
you eat
luckily you eat the eye and
pancreas which contain some vitamin
so you do not get scurvy

i be one lucky guy

you body chemistry and you exposure to
the element would normally lead to
irritability depression anxiety
period of selfreproach
it be almost
like schizophrenia
different side of
you personality might come to life
speak out act out

but all that be behind i
i be fine now

vietnam syndrome with you

yes yes he do

disruptiveness on you love one when
you return to you old life
