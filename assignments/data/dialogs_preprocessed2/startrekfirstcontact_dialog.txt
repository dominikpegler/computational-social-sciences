we will cover they

aye sir

starboard battery fire





the borg ship have modified it
shield captain
we phasers
will no longer be effective

ready quantum torpedo

aye sir
only three left

la forge to bridge

go ahead



captain i be starting to worry
about the hull integrity
we have
be running the support field at
full power for three hour
straight
i do not know how much
longer it be going to hold up

understand
keep i inform



incoming transmission from the
borg

on screen

you defense perimeter be
useless
you will be assimilated

break off you attack
by now
you must realize you can not win

you opinion be irrelevant
we
be the borg
resistance be
futile

we will see about that
fire






main power still online captain

casualty be light captain
minor buckle on the port
nacelle
nothing serious

incoming message from the starship
intrepid
admiral hayes

on screen

the new quantum torpedoe be
do the trick JeanLuc
we have
destroyed fortyseven borg ship
so far
and only lost fifteen of
we own
but one of the borg ship have
broken through we defenses and
it be heading directly for earth
can you handle it

absolutely

good hunt
hayes out

mister data set a pursuit course
maximum warp







we be approaching the terran
system captain

go to impulse
where be the borg
ship

it have enter earth orbit
correction it be not in orbit
it be heading directly toward the
surface

what

some sort of suicide tactic

unknown sir
suicide tactic be
not normally associated with the
borg

sensor show a temporal signature
emanate from the sphere
high
concentration of tachyon

and chronometric particle
it be
as though they be trying to create
a temporal vortex

time travel
they be attempting
time travel
full power mister data
Worf
quantum torpedoe at i command

aye sir






range fifty kilometer

temporal vortex be form
directly ahead of the sphere






main power offline

switching to emergency backup

we be catch in some kind of
energy wake from the vortex

Worf
torpedo
now





i have helm control

where be the sphere

they have travele into the
vortex
through time

the vortex be collapsing sir

contact starfleet command

no response
i be not reading any starfleet com
traffic in this entire sector

captain i have scan the planet
the atmosphere contain a high
concentration of methane carbon
monoxide and fluorine
the ocean
have be chemically altered as
well

on screen

life sign

population
thirtyfive
billion
all borg

the planet surface be covered
with borg technology
so be the moon
and three other
planet in this solar system

but how

they must have do it in the
past
they go back and
change history

they do it
they assimilated
earth

but if they changed history
then why be we still here

we be catch in the temporal
wake from the vortex
it must
have protected we from any change
in the timeline

captain there be five borg ship
closing in on we position

data set a course for that
vortex

captain

we have to follow they back
repair whatever damage they have
do to that timeline

course laid in
engaging impulse
engine





hull integrity down to thirty
percent

steady as she go


borg vessel be closing to two
thousand meter

take we in








report

we be still in earth orbit

on screen


what year be it

accord to we astrometric
reading
the year be

captain i have find the borg
sphere
it be on the far side of
the planet
firing at the
surface

intercept course full impulse
weapon status

Phasers be offline
we have
two quantum torpedoe left
but
the computer target system have
be destroyed

go to manual





over above action to
troi
track they weapon fire

western hemisphere
north
american continent

we be within torpedo range

they have see we
they be taking
evasive action

mister Worf

target

captain they be firing at a
nuclear missile silo
in central
montana

target

montana

target locked

fire





mister data i want to know the
exact date and time
give i a damage report on that
missile silo

today be march second
the
time in montana be oheightforty
five

look like they damaged the
silo

life sign

can not tell
Longrange bio
sensor be offline

Worf have doctor crusher mister
la forge and a security team meet
i in transporter room three
civilian clothes

aye sir

captain

in twentyfour hour Zephram
cochrane be suppose to conduct
the very first warp test
from
a missile silo in montana
if i be
right the borg be trying to
change the course of human history
by killing he or destroy his
ship

and if they succeed human will not
make first contact with the
vulcans tomorrow
as first officer i should be the
one beam down

normally i would agree
but in
this case the mission require a
certain knowledge of st century
history
you be many thing
number one but you be not much of
an historian

good luck sir

i will keep in contact
you have
the bridge




will somebody please tell i where
we be going

montana
energize

montana
well that answer
everything
why the hell be we




going to montana

i have the silo sir
bear
three one zero
distance three
hundred meter

let we go

go where
hello
be anyone going
to tell i what we be do here

we be here to find Zephram
cochrane
he may be injured or
dead

cochrane
the inventor of warp
drive

yes

but he be be dead for three
hundred
oh god
we have go back in time
again have not we

i be afraid so
if the borg
succeed in prevent first
contact with the vulcans
earth
will remain in the second dark
age
an easy target when the
borg arrive in the th century

well why do not you just say so
in the first place






lieutenant sandra farrel

it appear death be cause by a
plasma discharge
i will note in she record that she
never left she post

do you know she

not very well
we meet shortly
after the EnterpriseE be
commission
i find she to be
a most
promise officer

data
be you sure you be all
right

i be still have difficulty
integrate certain emotion into
i program
grief loss
remorse

we still have to make report on
ten more crewman killed in action
maybe you should deactivate you
emotion chip until we be do

no
human being do not have that
luxury and neither should i

i will admit
there be time
when i wish i have an emotion chip
i could turn on and off

Riker to data

go ahead commander



we be reading some kind of gas
leak in the environmental control
room
take a repair team down and
check it out

on i way commander





one of the diathermic oxygen tank
have be damaged

Diathermic oxygen

it be a new subsystem of nova
class ship
it regulate
hydropressure and temperature
variance
remain here
the gas be highly
corrosive to organic material
it
would liquefy you flesh on
contact

be i guest sir

begin a diagnostic on the safety
interlock
there appear to have
be some damage during the
attack

right


what the hell


ensign porter

ensign
be you all right

data to bridge

data to security
this be lieutenant data to anyone
who can hear i signal
i need
assistance in the environmental
control room





this must be it

how serious be the damage

i be have trouble scanning
underground
there be a lot of
radiation leak from something

probably from the nuclear warhead
cochrane be planning to use it to
ignite the warp drive

this will protect we from the
radiation

i be picking up faint life sign
twenty meter below

there should be an access hatch
nearby

over here

alphanumeric lock
we need a
password to get in

i have the password right here




see if any of these man be
cochrane

mitchell
DePaul

this one a woman
named kirby


there be a life sign behind this
door
about ten meter below

blast door
it be design to
protect the control room when the
missile be launch

there should be some kind of
manual release

get those fire out and then try
to restore main power to the
control room

aye sir

get it captain



there


severe radiation exposure

it be cochrane

i have stabilize he for now
but
he be in a coma and he be going to
need radiometric therapy
i want
to take he to the ship

picard to enterprise
enterprise please respond

it could be the radiation
captain
try from the surface

mister la forge listen very
carefully
if you remember you
history
in less than twenty
four hour a vulcan ship will be
passing through this system
when
it do this ship need to be in
space flying at warp speed

i would well get start




it be not the radiation
and
there be nothing wrong with the
combadges
the enterprise just
be not respond

JeanLuc this man need medical
attention now

as i recall the town of
resurrection be about two
kilometer east of here
they
might have a hospital

what be we waiting for
let we
go

it may not be that simple
this
be an extremely difficult and
paranoid time in human history

be you saying they will not help we

i be saying they might shoot we on
sight
you have to remember
these people have watch they
entire way of life collapse around
they

there must be some good people
even in this time

let we hope so
because if
cochrane die
the future may
die with he




i have assign two damage control
team to locate the source of we
communication problem
so far
they have have no success

assign another team if you need
to
i want to reestablish
communication with the captain as
soon as possible

be we in any danger of be
detect by earth defense system

there be no planetary defense
system in this era
they
weapon be design to
fight each other
not
extraterrestrial

we have to start think about a
way to get home
analyze we reading from the
temporal vortex
we be going to
have to recreate whatever the borg
do to

report

we just lost main power
and
we have get ClassThree alert all
over the ship
i be not sure
what be

shipwide decompression have be
initiated

what

we be venting we internal
atmosphere directly into space







what the hell be happening Worf

it appear that someone have taken
over the environmental control
room

someone

the borg
some of they must have
beamed over before we destroyed
they ship
seal off that entire deck with
emergency force field

wil
data be down there

mister Worf
find data if you
can but you top priority be
isolating the borg

understand







you effort to assimilate i will
be unsuccessful

it would appear that resistance be
not always futile

brave word
i have hear they
before from thousands of species
across thousands of world
since long before you be
created



but now
they be all one with
the borg

i be unlike any lifeform you have
encounter before
as an
android i be in complete control
of i neural net
the information
contained there cannot be forcibly
remove

you be an imperfect being
created by an imperfect being
finding you weakness be only a
matter of time









how long have he be unconscious

at least four hour

it look like he have a cranial
fracture but i will need xray to
be sure
get ruby in here

he have a severe fracture of the
leave occipital plate
he be not
hemorrhaging
but the radiation
have damaged he and he
cell count

cell count
what the hell
be you talking about

doctor crusher have be
study some advance medical
theory

re
tricorder
what be that

it be a
new medical scanner
it be a little more precise than an
Xray machine

be it japanese

um
yeah
now he be going to need a
respirator
do you have one

we have two
but we do not have
the juice to run they

juice

power
there have not be a lot of
wind through here for the last
couple of week
most of the
battery be depleted

do not you have any generator or
other fuel source

maybe you would like to take you
patient to the hospital in
Bozemen
it be only two hundred
mile away

he automatic reflex be
fluctuate
we have get to get he
on a respirator

bag he

beverly you tricorder

where be the battery room for the
hospital

i told you there be no

where

outside around back
next to the
water tank

he heartbeat irregular

adrenaline ten ccs







one
two
three
compress





what do you do to the battery

oh
just a little tinkering
how be he

he be stable
for now
but it would be good if we could
contact
we friend

yes
but until then you will have
to make do with what you have get

Thatll be interesting

what happen to he


there be some kind of explosion
out at the missile silo

ruby we be going to need a series
of cranial xray tonight

i have a fresh set of plate at
home
i will have they here by
eight

take care of he
he be a very
special man

yes he be

la forge to picard

i think there be someone in you
pants

excuse i
i have a
telephone
call

picard here

captain we have a problem
i
think you would well get back here

i be on i way
picard out

i have to go back to the silo
will you be all right

i will be fine
re
cochrane
he be a different story




catch

think you will need that

it be no zone solution
you know
no ozone


oh
yes
ultraviolet
protection
thank you
mister

lieutenant actually
lieutenant
jonathan Scrimm
i be the head of
the resurrection protective force
and you be

JeanLuc picard

great name
french

yes

you do not sound french

i be raised in england and here
in the states
thank you for
the
no zone

where in the states

oh
here and there
you know
how it be

not really
i be born and raised
right here
never have much use
for travel

where be you from most recently

california
san francisco

beautiful city
used to be
anyway
i do not think anyone
still live there

there be a few of we left

that be a pretty clever trick you
do with the hospital battery
how do you do it

it be not a trick
i used to be
an electrical engineer

huh

and what be you do out at the
missile silo

i be an old friend of Cochranes
i wanted to see how he be do

lucky for he you come by when you
do
he might be dead now

yes

maybe you can tell i what he be
be do in that silo
we hear
some explosion out there this
morning

i think he be running a test on
an old rocket engine
and one of
the fuel cell burst

you seem to have an answer for
everything

something wrong with that

not yet

re
balm
be sure you put that on
you need
a lot of protection around here

thank you
but i have never have
much trouble protecting myself






Worf to bridge
we be in
position



this be the bridge
i be release
the emergency force field






Worf to bridge

Riker here

there be a dampen field in place
on this deck
we tricorders be
useless


what the hell be going on

borg


Worf to bridge
we be about to
enter the environmental control
room

any sign of data or the borg
themselves

negative
however they have
reconfigure the network
and rerout all power on this
deck into environmental control

stand by commander
where be ensign hawk

Worf
be something wrong

something be very wrong
commander
we be falling back

cybernetic nightmare
body into human flesh

fire at will

fall back

go go


behind they at the pursuing borg to no effect
out of they arm and wrist taking two
security guard
Worf see they fall but there be no
time to go back







Worf to bridge force field

what the hell happen down there
Worf

commander
we have a problem




cochrane be going to use this
solid rocket booster to lift the
ship into orbit
before the warp
drive take over
everything
would depend on these old chemical
engine
now here the problem

re
damage
this used to be the throttle valve
assembly
it control the thrust of the
engine
it be be completely
vaporized
and without it
there be no way to launch the ship

can you reconstruct the throttle
valve

yeah
if i know what it look
like
there be probably five
hundred way to design a valve
like this

we need to launch this ship in
under eighteen hour
there must be some design
schematics
blueprint

we be tearing this place apart
looking for they
but the
computer be down and the fire
destroyed half the file
so
far nothing

if it be just part of the warp
drive i would know what to do
but
this
it be like trying to
rebuild orville wrights airplane
with canvass and stick

wait a minute



yeah i look at these already

you can almost see the throttle
assembly in this one
but this
guy walk in front of it when
they take the picture

could you reconstruct the throttle
from a photograph like this
if
that man be not block the view

maybe
sure
yeah
as long as i could
get a clear look at the intake
configuration
but so far we
have not find any other photo

if there be other photograph
i think i may know how to find
they




you resistance be
illogical
to we you neural net be simply
another piece of technology
we
will learn it secret

who be you

i be the borg

that be a contradiction
the borg
act as a collective consciousness
there be no individual

i be the begin
the end
i
be the one who be many
i be the
borg

you be the guiding intelligence
behind the borg

intelligence
ambition
desire
i bring order to
chaos

it be unfortunate we will have to
destroy you to obtain the
information we need
you be a
unique lifeform
synthetic
and yet far more than
a simple automaton
you have no idea how close to
perfection you be

how do you define perfection

blend of the organic and the
synthetic
the high form of
life in the galaxy

an interesting definition
but it
be not one that apply to i
i
be completely artificial
i have
no organic component

have you ever wonder what it be
like to have flesh

it be impossible to imagine
sensation for which i have no
frame of reference

that
can change



set phasers to rotating
modulation

that be it they have adjusted
fall back




all right
we have lost control of
eight deck
three cargo bay
one Shuttlebay

do we have any idea how many borg
we be dealing with

we see at least thirty
and
there be twentytwo enterprise
crewmember reported miss
including commander data

we will have to assume they have be
assimilated into the collective

even data

Datas positronic net contain
classify information on the
enterprise
command code
security protocol

if they control data they control
the ship

we can not worry about that right
now
let we concentrate on what we
can

to control the enterprise they will
have to gain access to one of two
location
main engineering
or
the bridge

we have to cover both
possibility
we will take care of the bridge
Worf take you man and seal off
main engineering
turn it into a
fortress nothing get in








shut that door

what be you an idiot
do not
you see the red light be on

ah
yes
but i do not realize
that

thank god this plate be already
fix

re
Xray
cochrane

yes
and i only have enough
silver halide for one shot
so
you be lucky you do not screw it
up

i be very sorry

do not worry about it

do you need something

yes
i wanted to ask you about
some photograph i see out at the
silo
there be three of they
printed on some kind of fabric

bed sheet
i used i last set of bed sheet to
make those print
not the good
material but i have not see a
clean piece of paper in five
year

do you take any other picture of
the rocket

sure
why do you want to buy they

yes
i do not have any money right
now but i may be able to get
some

money
so you can get dome
money

i can try

you would have to try real hard
no
one used currency in over ten
year
what be you from another
planet

no
but sometimes i feel that
way
what i mean be i would be will
to trade for the photograph

trade
okay
the photograph
for a straight answer
who be you
and how do you know
Zephram

i be an old friend
i meet he
when he be do his
undergraduate work at cornell back
in

fray not



what

you be lying

what make you say that

you be not someone who lie very
easily
so it be obvious when you
do
at least to i

be you always sucha good judge
of character

always



the occipital fracture be
widen
we be going to have
to fuse the bone

i be a little worry about some of
these bone fragment
if they
move any close to the brain we
could be looking at a hemorrhage

be the two of you
involve

no
not like you and doctor
crusher used to be

how do you know about that

i do not

we can not take any more xray
until i can mix up a new batch of
the silver halide

can you do it tonight
we may
have to operate

sure
it will be ready by morning

ruby
i need to talk to you
about those photograph
it be
very important

i be sure it be
but it will have to
wait until tomorrow

it can not wait until tomorrow

too bad
besides it will give you all night
to think up a new set of lie




double check each assault
phaser
make certain that the
range set be no more than
thirty meter
we do not want to
blast through the hull

be you sure you do not want
something a little more
sophisticated sir

mind you post lieutenant



Riker to engineering
mister
Worf
the borg be approaching
you position

understand
we be ready



charge weapon











they be bypass engineering

where the hell be they going




data

you have taken you first step
toward perfection
how do it
feel

i do not know what you be
refer to

that be because you have not be
properly
stimulated yet

re
flesh
do you know what this be data

it would appear that you be
attempting to graft organic skin
onto i endoskeletal structure

what a cold description
for
such a beautiful gift



be that good for you

it be
interesting

do it again
please




















you should pay close attention to
those little red light

you know i would be perfectly
justified in shooting you right
now

i would say you already have

do not flatter yourself
i take
picture of a lot of junk

okay let we hear it
i be sure you
have a great explanation for why
those rocket photo be so
important you broke into i house

we be trying to repair doctor
Cochranes ship
it be be
damage and

we

myself
and a few other friend
of Zephrams

friends from cornell

some

lie
that be one
keep going

key piece of the ship have be
destroyed
and we only hope to
reconstruct it be if one of you
photograph show we what it
look like

all right
truth
i believe that
one
why be it so urgent you
could not wait until morning

we have to launch he ship by
tomorrow afternoon

or

or the shield around the
plutonium core will begin to
deteriorate
within a day the
entire silo will become so
radioactive that no one will be
able to come near it for a hundred
year

lie
that be two
one more and
i pull the trigger
picard be starting to get angry

why be you be so difficult
all i be asking for be to look at
one of the photograph
it will
take five minute

and all i be asking for be the
truth
that would take five
minute
for all i know you cause the
explosion at the silo
and now
you be trying to steal Zephrams
ship

i be not a thief

no you be a petty burglar and a
liar
you be no friend of Zephrams
he
be a great man
he be not like you
or i or any of the other zomby
walking around this town

no
he be a man with vision
he
can see beyond the problem that
surround we
he know there be a
well future out there for
everyone
a future where crime
poverty and war be thing of the
past
a future where we reach
out and seek we destiny in the
star
i believe in that future too
ruby
i believe in it in every
fiber of i being
and i be
telling you
if we do not launch
that warp ship tomorrow there be
a very good chance that future
will never happen

you will not regret this








what be they do

they appear to be modifying the
deflector dish

to do what
if they wanted a
weapon they could have taken over
a phaser bank or torpedo bay

deflector dish
why the
deflector dish

it do not make sense
the
deflector be only used for
shielding and long range
sensor

computer magnify grid twenty
one alpha

they be rerout the deflector
power conduit

computer thermal enhancement

they be connecting the conduit to
subspace communication

they be convert the deflector
dish into an antennae

they may be trying to send a
message to the other borg
the
borg in this time period

what kind of message

if it be i
i would say attack
earth now
in the st
century
they will be too strong
in the th


we have to stop they from sending
that message

agreed
option

destroy the deflector dish

can we aim we dorsal phasers at
it

we have lost control of all weapon
system
transporter be
down
we can not get to a
Shuttlecraft
and it would take
we too long to fight we way down
to deflector control

there be another way commander
do you remember you zeroG combat
train

i remember it make i sick

what be you suggest

i think mister Worf be suggest
that we go outside for a little
stroll



i be almost afraid to say this
captain
but i think it be going
to work



where be you get the alloy for the
throttle itself

they used copper pipe in they
plumb
so i melt it down
and fuse it with some tritanium
from one of we phaser casing
it be not the strong alloy
but it be good than all this
crude aluminum and steel



mister lange have you bring
the computer system back online
yet

aye captain
this trinary
language be pretty archaic
but
i think i understand it now

good



be we on schedule
the vulcan
ship will be here in less than two
hour

it will be tight but we should make
it

what about we warp signature
it
have to be strong enough for they
to detect

i have enhanced the plasma injector
do not worry they will see it

well with any luck
the vulcans
will land outside resurrection
tomorrow morning
and earth will
never be the same again



all right
i would well start
familiarize myself with the
flight control

doctor crusher at the access
hatch captain

let she in



let i get this straight
you be
from the future
i be about to
change history
and all i have
to do be sit here and let you fly
i ship


that be right

and people say i be crazy

i assure you doctor that after
today
no one will ever call you
that again

just do i a favor
bring i
ship back in one piece

that be a promise

doctor
i name be Geordi la
forge
i be an engineer
can i
shake you hand

i wish i could go with you
be
there anything i can do to help

not really
but i do have about
a thousand question i have always
wanted to ask you

since time be short
why do not
you pick the top ten and fire
away


you actually perform surgery

it be an experience
metal
scalpel
needle and thread

re
device
but i have a little help
surgical
transporter
i used it to beam
out most of the bone fragment
from he brain

how do doctor almack react to
that

he be so confuse by what i be
do i do not think he even
notice
any word from the enterprise

not yet

you think they be still up there

if they be not
we would well get
used to living in montana

that might not be so bad
at
least for you

what be that suppose to mean

i see the way you looker at she
and i know that look

regardless of how i may feel about
ruby
we fate lie along
different path
nothing can
change that

you want some advice
do not do
this again
you know exactly what i mean

beverly there be many reason
why you and i

i would call they excuse
and the
first excuse on both we list be
we sense of duty
we convinced
ourselves that it be more
important than anything else
and
you know what
it be not

i have a ship to launch







how do you feel


different

i internal sensor tell i the
ambient temperature in the room be
ten point two degree celsius
but i
skin
tell i it be cold

i visual acuity have be reduced
by seventyeight percent
and i
can no longer perceive light
beyond the ultraviolet or the
infrared
but i can
see

until today
you emotion be
trapped inside an artificial
she will
you do not know what it
be to truly
feel
and there be so much more for you
to experience
i will guide you
into a world of sensation unlike
anything you can imagine
all you have to do
be give we
access to you neural net

no
i will not betray i friend

they be not you friend
they have hold you back
keep you
from you destiny

that be not true
they have tried
to help i

have they given you what i have
given you
do they even try

i
do not want this

you be becoming more human all the
time data
now you be learning
how to lie

i wish to
go back to the way i
be

more lie
pain
the shock
small trickle of
blood
come from

have you ever know a woman
do
you know what it be like to feel
she breath on you face
she
skin against yours
flesh
against flesh

i creator do not intend for i
to experience these thing

i be you creator now




you will have to realign the
target array of the quantum
torpedo
and reprogram the
warhead for the localize
detonation
there be only one torpedo left

i guess i would well get it right
the first time

the borg will undoubtedly attack
set phasers to rotating
modulation

ready

good luck



Depressurize

activate magnetic constrictor




be you alright

just a little queasy

try not to look at the star
keep you eye on the ship

right

and commander whatever you do
do
not
vomit in you exosuit
it
would be
unpleasant

i will keep that in mind

over and under

above we
be covered





Worf
i be going to need at least
five minute

understand

ruby
be now standing outside at the hatch

phoenix we have a problem out
here
there be a woman at the
outer hatch
say she name
ruby sloan and she want to see
the captain

what do you want i to do sir

we can not let she in
she will see
cochrane be not making the flight

we can not leave she out there
when the ship launch
she will
be killed

tell she to go back to
resurrection

she be a very
determine woman
phoenix to control
mister
lange
let she in

aye sir


Scrimm and three militia soldier
holding she at



ms
sloane if you will have a seat
i will let you talk to





commander you be five minute be
up




the borg be charging the subspace

no good sir
they be on internal
power
we can not stop the launch
from here

re
blast door
what about these door

they be locked down tight from the
inside

and those door be make to
withstand a nuclear attack



one minute to launch

mister picard
this be
lieutenant Scrimm
i be going to
have to insist that you shut down
the launch
you see i know what
you be do
and i be not going
to just stand by and let it
happen
stop the launch or i will kill
every one of you people out
here
and i think you know
who will be first



say hello

JeanLuc
remember that future
we talk about
it be all that
matter
launch the ship

go ahead launch it
ruby will
be here when you get back
but
she will not have a whole lot to say


stop
at second

captain

this be picard
i have suspended
the launch sequence

thanks
now why do not you join
we and we will have a little talk

captain
we have get less than ten
minute before that vulcan ship
leaf the system
we have get to
go
now

it will have to wait
come on



Geordi can you see into the room



no
the door too thick

then we will just have to assume
it be still there

what be still there

get a tricorder
you be going to
have to track i exact position in
that room



both tumble off into space together





Selfdestruct in three minute




what do you want

the invasion plan

invasion

these people you be calling
vulcans
who be they
where
do they come from
how many
troop
what kind of weapon








tractor beam engaged
we have
get they commander

Prismify the beam
get rid of
that borg






do not look at the star
do not
look at the star




there be no invasion

wrong answer mister picard
try
again

all right
you want the truth
the vulcans
be highly
intelligent alien



alien
that be what i think
from where
canada



from another planet
oh i almost forget
they
have green blood and point ear

and you know all this
because
you be
a spaceman too

i be afraid you have catch i
i be
a spaceman

truth
he be telling the truth

you be an entertain man mister
picard
but you be also full of
shit
very quickly

now Geordi

actually
you be
full of shit

now tell you man to drop they
weapon

weapon
down

be you all

i be
grateful for what you have
given i
but i still do not wish
to be assimilated

universe of sensation be waiting
for you
do not you want to
explore it
with i

yes

then take the final step
give
i the enterprise
and we can be
together
always

no
i cannot

i have deactivate the sensory
input
that flesh on you body
be just meat now

no
no please
you cannot

you must give i what i want
now
without the deflector dish
we can no longer send for an early
invasion
we must assimilate
earth ourselves
i need this
ship
feel
once again

be not it good like this

yes
but the enterprise
i
duty

be to yourself
do not make i
hurt you again
shock
back

no
no it be so
empty
please
give it back
i need
it

and i need to control this ship
let i into you mind
kiss
he on the mouth

in order to access i neural
net
you will need to create a
positronic interface
i will tell you how




ready to deploy the warp nacelle

as they used to say
all system
be go





the vulcans should be out there
right now
we need to break the
warp barrier in the next five
minute if we be going to get
they attention

bring the warp core online
i will
lay in a head

the nacelle be charged
nuclear warhead standing by
we be ready to ignite the warp
drive

engage





warp field look good
structural integrity holding

speed
twenty thousand
kilometer per second


fast



i have to admit there be a moment
there when

hold that thought

strong heart
weak stomach

report

we have lost bridge control

emergency override

nothing



i be rerout bridge command
function to this location

eliminate they remain
defenses
i will send borg to
assimilate the rest of the crew

there be a perimeter alert

ship have enter sensor range

vulcan

no


give i helm control





pass onehalf light speed
the
starboard nacelle running a
little hot

i be on it

the inertial damper be have
trouble compensating
i do not
think cochrane build this thing
for comfort

speed two hundred seventyfive
thousand kilometer per second

there be no temporal shield in
here
we be starting to pick up
relativistic effect

one minute to warp threshold





captain the enterprise

picard to enterprise
picard to enterprise do you
read i

they com system must still be
down

well i feel a whole lot well
with they out there
we may need
some help



i have repaired the weapon array
Phasers be online

the target lock be not work

i do not understand
the optical
data network have be repaired
and all system be functioning

you diagnostics be in error
i
need weapon

the problem must lie in the
interface between starfleet and
borg technology
you console may
not be configure to handle the
data flow

can you configure it

i believe so

do it





approach light speed

they be get awfully close
what the hell be they do

we be crossing the threshold


slow
it be on the verge of



i believe i see the problem

diathermic oxygen tank
see early


burst out of the ruptured

no













bring we about

drop out of warp

let we begin the land procedure




data










be not anyone going to say welcome
back


do it work


mister la forge
now i would like to
shake you hand




captain log march rd
the voyage of the phoenix be a
success
again






and it appear the vulcan ship have
detect the warp signature and be
now on it way to earth







doctor cochrane
this be you
moment

i god
they be really from
another world

that be right
and they be going
to want to meet the man who fly
that warp ship

and that be suppose to be i

Zephram you have the vision to
build that ship when no one else
on this planet could see beyond
they own problem
you fly that ship
all i do
be push a few button

all right
and do not worry i will keep you
secret







live long and prosper

um
thank



Riker to enterprise
five to beam
up


you be leaving be not you

i have to

where
and do not tell i san
francisco

no
it be a lot far than that

it be the future be not it
just
like you told Scrimm
i know you be not from around
here

no
i be from france

i do not care if you be from france
or venus
just take i with you

that be impossible

why

this may be hard for you to
understand
but i be dutybound
not to interfere with you or
anyone else here

you have be interfering with i
life ever since i meet you
do not stop now

ruby
i be sorry
remembering he word
to beverly
but we fate lie along different
path

picard to enterprise
one to

Riker here
captain we do not
get you whole transmission

to hell with fate

say again captain

enterprise
two to beam up





how be mister data

he be in Sickbay
doctor crusher
say he can be repaired
but we
have to wait until we

return to we own time

yes sir

then make it so
have you
determined how to recreate the
temporal vortex

yes sir
but captain
be
we
all going back

unless you would like to stay

no sir

bridge to engineering
mister la
forge
initiate the temporal
vortex







incoming transmission from
starfleet command
admiral hayes

onscreen


admiral
what be the status of
the borg fleet

it be be destroyed
the borg
threat be over
be you all right
the enterprise
disappeared from we sensor for
a moment

we be fine sir
it will take
some
time to explain

i look forward to reading you
report

that make two of we






to a couple of

s
no no we will have to rip out
this entire bulkhead
we will need
new brace member for the deck
above and below

data

you look good as new

you could say that i be back to i
old self

that be great

she remains
be they still
here

i be sending they to the Daystrom
institute for analysis

i never realized how powerful an
emotion temptation could be

temptation
you said in you
report it be all a ruse
you
be manipulating she

she be
a unique lifeform
in
she own way
nearly perfect

it almost sound like you miss
she






welcome home
