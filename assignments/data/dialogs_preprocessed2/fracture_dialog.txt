five minute ago

put he back on the witness stand if
you do not believe i

we can not put he back on now
not
after what the jury just see
you
honor i told you this would turn into
a circus
first he provoke the
witness with an outrageous allegation

i dick have evidence

i
guess i should call he as a rebuttal


witness
he be get phone record
credit receipt photograph
videotape all document the
affair
in graphic detail
beat
mildly

dick be good

okay um
i will stipulate that i
witness be less than forthcoming
and that can more or less cancel
out the fact that the defendant
withhold a crucial

mr
Slocum you witness be intimate
with the victim and he assault the
defendant during the arrest

actually while obtain i socalled
confession


no way
you honor

he be get a point
they be alone in
the house
the confession be no good

be this a legal argument
oh come
on

you want to get into it

sorry
he dictate and signed he confession
after that incident


in police custody
arguably in fear
for he life
i be sorry mr
Slocum
it be all fruit of the taint tree

we have to exclude all version of the
confession and any evidence collected
by lieutenant Nunally or by other
police officer on the night he be
present

this be insane

it be biblical be not it
the fruit
and the tree and

he set this up

we do not know
where it be going
i have cheated so
many time i be numb but she be
new
and she make i feel like
there be some chance
to change
we be scare
it be like we be
afraid to go forward but we could not
go back
you always think you have time
to
work it out
or make thing right

thaw it out check inside


the garage
Washerdryer

and the tool she would and the roof and
the



duct

what about the door frame
the
floor

what do he do
rip open a door frame
hide the gun inside and replaster the
wall before show up

what about the neighbor property
he could have throw it over the
hedge

we checked
he might have passed it off to
somebody willy
have an accomplice
waiting out the back


this be not an accomplice sort of guy

this be a
guy who like to show off

you sure

i be sure

it be a physical object
it can not just
vanish
we be missing something
some step in the story

the neighbor see she get home
he be
already inside
she let we herself in
minute or two later
bloodpattern
say she be standing over there he be
somewhere around here

boom

but then he carry she back there
why


because he be going to need time
to
confess
when she be alone with the
cop

neighbor come to the door

crawford shout leave we alone and
fire three more round
boomboom
boom

so everybody know he be dangerous
and she might still be alive

so they will call the negotiator
now he be get about ten minute

i be sorry willy



do you dare stay out
do you dare go in




and you go in
should you turn leave or right
or right and threequarter
or maybe not quite



you can get so confuse that you will
start in to race
down long wiggle road at break
neck pace



and grind on for mile across weirdish
wild space
headed i fear toward a most useless
place



the waiting place
for people just waiting
wait for a train to go
or a bus to come or a plane to go



or the mail to come or the rain to go
or the phone to ring or the snow to
snow




or waiting around for a yes or no
or waiting for they hair to grow
everyone be just waiting



wait for the fish to bite
or waiting for wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for friday night
or waiting perhaps for they uncle
jake

or a pot to boil or a good break
or a string of pearl or a pair of
pants
or a wig with curl
or another chance



what be you do

i hear it might help if somebody
talk to she

you be a good lawyer
all this may
have even make you a good lawyer
do not waste it


i do not just lose a case
i let a
man get away with murder

if it make you feel any good
technically you let a man get away
with attempt murder

he wife be dead

we can still get he
we can take he
back to court

willy

double jeopardy do not apply
we
bring a new charge of homicide

willy what happen to you on the
helicopter we do not even know if we
could prove


no
he shoot she and she die
the
fact that it take time the fact that
he go to trial in between just for
shooting she do not matter
he
fired a gun and cause she death and
that be murder
if he can twist the law around then
so can we

second indictment on the same
incident

man burn down a house
we charge
he with arson
there be people
sleeping upstairs and after week in
the hospital they die
we would charge
he with murder
right

all you evidence be still toxic
the
confession the arrest it be all
still inadmissible

i be sorry willy
it be a good idea
but

i will get something new

how

you do not want to know

willy you can not


i do not work for you
right

do not do anything crazy

what else have we get left

i need a favor

these be from that thing at the
courthouse right

Uhhuh


very dramatic

you be not see nothing yet

i want the gun

why
you have already get one

i want the gun you shoot you wife
with
now

one way or another i be going to see
to it you receive justice tonight

you be serious be not you

oh yes

willy
you get religion do not you
you care
that be
priceless


no it be very sweet
really

going to be a whole lot less funny in
about a minute

get it like this
be that going to
hold up in court

i do not work for the

any more
i be just a guy who broke into you
house
when the police arrest i
they will inventory anything in i
possession
if that happen to be
crucial evidence in another case
well
some prosecutor just get lucky

it take a very special kind of person
to look right into someone eye and
pull the trigger
it take a unique
kind of strength

i guess you would know that

yes
i would

i do not think so

you do not know i

no


then i be in for a rude awaken

Ticktock

where do you even get yourself a gun

it be Nunallys

Nunallys
really

yeah
really

there i be with a perfectly good
weapon just sitting in the evidence
warehouse

willy
put it down


i think you might appreciate the
irony

willy
think



perfectly good
heckler and koch
ninemillimeter


the police will be here very soon

the exact same type of gun you buy
you wife a month before

if they see you with a gun in you
hand they be not likely to ask a lot
of question


that be why you go to the hotel



that be why you go into the room

you take he gun



and you left he yours

i give it back

yes you do




after you would used it



then you told Nunally you would put it
down if he put down he

that be why you moved she back there



the truth be i could have do it
right in front of the man and he
would not have notice

he have
other thing on he mind




and all you have to do be switch the
gun back in the commotion



and then wait



until Nunally walk the murder
weapon right out of the house

brilliant

you know this be really kind of fun
it be like showing some caveman a
cigarette lighter

this caveman going to put you in prison
for the rest of you life

it be still not evidence willy
there be no print left by now
nothing tie that gun to i


no
that would be true
except for
all those egg

those what

with all those little crack and weak
place
like Nunally
shooting
himself right there in the
courthouse
i do not think he be
going to do that
do you

no

i mean we all know he be going to
fall apart sooner or later
that be
part of you plan right
like a bank
shoot on a pool table
you kill you
wife and destroy she lover
with
one bullet
well
four bullet actually
right

first bullet go into you wife




then three more out the front of the
house to get some attention

then while you be waiting for the show
to begin you have to reload
Nunallys gun




i mean you do not want he wonder
where the hell four bullet go
considering he never fired he gun
that night

and i be betting you do not worry about
fingerprint

i mean why would you
Nobodys going
to be looking at he gun

and sooner or late life go on
those four incriminate bullet would
get used and be go forever



except Nunally only fired one of those
bullet
into himself


which mean there be still three left
with you fingerprint on they tom
in this clip

everybody have a weak spot right
some place they break
