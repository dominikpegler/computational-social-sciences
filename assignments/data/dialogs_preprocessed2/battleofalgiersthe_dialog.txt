Medjebri move away from the register still standing behind the bar

no
it say the policeman
the policeman be leaning on the bar
he be tall and husky and be

okay

at the corner right in front of the
large clock there will be a girl
carrying a basket
when the policeman
come out you will follow he together
at the right moment she will give you a
pistol
you have only to shoot
quickly and in the back

do not move
look at he

by obey
such an order you still could have

if you be with the police
you would not have do it

you be exaggerate
the order
be to shoot he in the back

i do not do that kind of thing

then do not complain

you still have not tell i why you do not
let i kill he

because we be not ready yet for the

following a lengthy discussion the
general assembly of the unite nation have
decided it agenda for the forthcoming
debate
reunification of korea
disarmament
the algerian question
colombia have proposed that only the first
two point be discuss for the day
however the AfroAsian nation opposed
underline the importance they attribute
to the algerian question






mr
raymond lefevre inspector general
of the administration have preside over
a meet in which important decision
have be taken with the aim of secure
public order and the protection of
person and they property
in particular
it have be decided to recall the tenth
division of paratrooper to algiers that
until now have be employed in the
antiguerrilla operation on the Cabiro
plateau
the commander general of the
tenth division will assume responsibility
for the maintenance of order in algiers
and will have at he disposal in order to
achieve this goal all civil and military
means provide for the defense of the
zone

the rd regiment colonial paratrooper be now before the commissioner

emanate a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position

the result be that in the last two
month they have reach an average of

assault per day including
aggression against individual and the
explosion
of course the condition of
the problem be as usual
first the
adversary
second the method to destroy
he
there be arab in the
casbah
be they all against we
we know
they be not
in reality it be only a
small minority that dominate with
terror and violence
this minority be
we adversary and we must isolate and
destroy it

draw it down there too

he be an adversary who shift he
position above and below the surface with
highly commendable revolutionary method
and original tactic

he be an
anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who
mingle with thousands of other who
resemble he
we find he everywhere
in
the alley of the casbah
in the street
of the european city and in working
place

go ahead martin

here be some film taken by the police
the camera be hidden at the casbah
exit
they think these film might be
useful and in fact they be useful in
demonstrate the usefulness of certain
method
or at least they inadequacy

i choose these film because they be
shoot in the hour preceding some recent
terroristic assault
and so among all
these arab man and woman there be the
one responsible
but which one be they
how can we recognize they
controlling
document be ridiculous
one who have
everything in order be most likely to be
the terrorist

note the intuition of the cameraman
he
realized that in that box there have to
be something of interest and he pause
to focus it

maybe the bomb be hidden right there in
a double bottom
who know
we will never
know

that be enough martin

we must start again from scratch
the only
information that we have concern the
structure of the organization
and we
shall begin from that

it be a pyramidlike organization divided
into a series of sector
at the top of
the pyramid be they general staff

the military commander responsible for
the executive body find the right man
and nominate he to responsibility for
a sector
number one
number one in he
turn choose another two
number two and
number three
and so they form the
first triangle

now number two and number three choose
in they turn two man each
number
four and five and so on

the reason for this geometry be so that
every militant will know only three
member in the entire organization
he
commander who have chosen he and the two
member that he himself have chosen
contact take place only by written
instruction
that be why we do not
know we adversary
because in
practice they do not even know each
other

to know they mean to eliminate they
consequently the military aspect be
secondary to the police method
i know we
be not fond of this word but it be the
only word that indicate exactly the type
of work that we must perform
we must
make the necessary investigation in
order to proceed from one vertex to
another in the entire pyramid
the
reason for this work be information
the
method be interrogation
and
interrogation become a method when
conduct in a manner so as to always
obtain a result or rather an answer
in practice demonstrate a false
humanitarianism only lead to the
ridiculous and to impotence
i be
certain that all the unit will
understand and react accordingly
however success do not depend solely
on we
we need to have the casbah at we
disposal
we must sift through it
and
interrogate everyone
and here be where
we find ourselves hinder by a
conspiracy of law and regulation that
continue to be operative as if algiers
be a holiday resort and not a
battleground
we have requested a carte
blanche
but it be very difficult to
obtain
therefore it be necessary to
find an excuse to legitimize we
intervention and make it possible
it
be necessary to create it ourselves
this excuse
unless we adversary will
think of it themselves which seem to be
what they be do

we have organized thing in such a way
that during the strike they will be
guest of other family who have home
and will provide shelter in the event of
possible reprisal
but i do not know
that they would be bring to this house
too
it be a mistake

why

because you be here too
it would be
well for you to move to another house

all right
you be the one who must
decide

no if i be the one to decide you
would not be in algiers now

why
be not it wise

it be not wise

ali you must accompany ben MHidi to the
maison des Arbres

why
be not he sleeping here

no it be good if he do not
the house
be filled with new people

here another one ready
what a hideout
it really look like a wall
i will dirty
it a bit and it be perfect
want to give
a look inside

no go now
it be already late

they be a family of militant from way
back
everything will work out well
you will see
mon ali hurry up

alright
see you tomorrow

passing along the terrace only take
five minute
and with ali la pointe
you will be safe

but it be he who will not be safe with i







here it be
we have arrive

not yet

be careful now
unless you know how it
work it be good if you sit on the plank
and move forward like this

let we try

it be good nobody be following we

it be a question of habit

it be good if i go first to make sure
everything okay
when ali la pointe return ben MHidi be still leaning on the railing

Everythings okay
they be waiting for
you

what do you think of the strike ali

i think it will be a success

yes i think so too
it be be
organized well
but what will the
french do

it be clear
they will do everything
possible to make it fail

no they will do even more
we have given
they the opportunity to do a lot more
do you understand what i mean
starting
tomorrow they will not be groping in the
dark any more
every shop and every
worker who strike will be a known enemy
a selfconfessed criminal
and they
will be able to pass to the offensive
have you think of this

no

but kader told i that you be not in
favor of the strike

no and neither be i man

why

because they told we that we must not use
weapon now when the time be right

that be true
war be not win with
terrorism neither war nor revolution
terrorism be a begin but afterward
all the people must act
this be the
reason for the strike and it necessity
to mobilize all algerian count they and
measure they strength

to show they to the right

yes
yes
the problem also involve the

i do not know what it be worth but this
way we will give the the possibility of
evaluating we strength

do you know something ali
starting a
revolution be hard and it be even hard
to continue it
win be hard of all
but only afterward when we have win
will the real hardship begin

anyway there be still a lot to be do
you be not already tire ali be

ben MHidi be standing in front of the journalist with handcuff on

mr
ben MHidi
do not you think it be
a bit cowardly to use you woman basket
and handbag to carry explosive device
that kill so many innocent people

and do not it seem to you even more
cowardly to drop napalm bomb on unarmed
village so that there be a thousand
time more innocent victim
of course
if we have you airplane it would be a lot
easier for we
give we you bomber and
you can have we basket

mr
ben MHidi
in you opinion have
the any chance to beat the french
army

in i opinion the have more chance
of beating the french army than the
french have to stop history

mr
ben MHidi colonel mathieu have say
that you have be arrested by accident
practically by mistake
in fact it seem
that the paratrooper be looking for
someone much less important than yourself
can you tell we why you be in that
apartment at rue debussy last night

i can only tell you that it would have
be good if i have never be there

that be enough gentleman
it be late and
we all have a lot of work

be the show already over

yes it be over
before it become
selfdefeating






colonel mathieu
the spokesman for the
reside minister mr
Gorlin have stated
that larbi ben MHidi commit suicide
in he own cell hanging himself with
piece of he shirt that he have used to
make a rope and then attached to the
bar of he cell window
in a precede
statement the same spokesman have
specify that

due to the intention
already expressed by the prisoner ben
MHidi to escape at the first opportunity
it have be necessary to keep he hand
and foot bound continually
in you
opinion colonel in such condition be
a man capable of tearing he shirt
making a rope from it and attach it
to a bar of the window to hang himself

you should address that question to the
minister spokesman
i be not the one who
make those statement
on i part i
will say that i have the opportunity to
admire the moral strength intelligence
and unwavering idealism demonstrated by
ben MHidi
for these reason although
remembering the danger he represent i
do not hesitate to pay homage to his
memory

colonel mathieu
much have be say
lately not only of the success
obtain by the paratrooper but also of
the method that they have employed
can you tell we something about this

the success obtain be the result
of those method
one presuppose the
other and vice versa

excuse i colonel
i have the impression
that perhaps due to excessive prudence
i colleague continue to ask the same
allusive question to which you can only
respond in an allusive manner
i think it
would be good to call thing by they
right name
if one mean torture then
one should call it torture

i understand
what be you question

the question have already be ask
i
would only like some precise answer
that be all

let we try to be precise then
the word
torture do not appear in we order
we have always spoken of interrogation as
the only valid method in a police
operation directed against unknown
enemy
as for the they request
that they member in the event of
capture should maintain silence for
twentyfour hour and then they may
talk
thus the organization have already
have the time necessary to render useless
any information furnished
what type
of interrogation should we choose

the one the court use for a crime of
homicide which drag on for month

the law be often inconvenient colonel

and those who explode bomb in public
place do they perhaps respect the law
when you ask that question to ben
MHidi remember what he said
no
gentleman believe i it be a vicious
circle
and we could discuss the problem
for hour without reaching any
conclusion
because the problem do
not lie here
the problem be
the
want we to leave algeria and we want to
remain
now it seem to i that despite
vary shade of opinion you all agree
that we must remain
when the rebellion
first begin there be not even shade
of opinion
all the newspaper even the
leftwing one wanted the rebellion
suppress
and we be send here for
this very reason
and we be neither
madman nor sadist gentleman
those who
call we fascist today forget the
contribution that many of we make to the
resistance
those who call we nazi do
not know that among we there be
survivor of dachau and buchenwald
we
be soldier and we only duty be to
win
therefore to be precise i would
now like to ask you a question
should
france remain in algeria
if you answer
yes then you must accept all the
necessary consequence
