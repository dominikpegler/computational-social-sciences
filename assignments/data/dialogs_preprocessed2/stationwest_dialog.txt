frank fenton winston miller
base on a novel by
luke short

why

he just seem kind of free with that
money

yourself

alone

not till after the first one

you a stranger here

to barman after
gulp it in one
gulp
what kind of whiskey be that

way you take it i do not see what
difference it make

that be what i could never take
looking at Stellmans
stripe

if you want to make it a personal
matter

i do not make it anything soldier
you tried to sell something and i
do not buy it so why do not you

if i be not in uniform i might
teach you some manner

if you could teach i anything you
would not be in a uniform

you could not be looking for trouble

the good place west of the atlantic
ocean to find it

too big like you ear

how be it now

i be still a little sore at he

sit down mr
haven

thank you captain

so you be operating under seal
order

all this mumbo jumbo be characteristic
of the military information
department

we use it as sparingly as possible

i have be in this territory for a
number of year and i think it
might be a little rough here than
a suburb of washington


very possibly

then why be
i

sending you out
here

because two soldier have be
murdered

and they think i can not handle that

they merely know you have not

i have only ninetyfour man on the
post with indian trouble up north
the war department have refuse to
send reinforcement or be i bore
you

i be not the war department

the two soldier be killed while
escort one of the gold stage

be escort gold a function of you
command

young man the function of i command
look very pretty on paper but they be
not very practical in a territory
like this
do you have any illusion
about that

i have no illusion about anything

what be happening to the gold

i have permitted it to be stored in a
warehouse on the post
now everybody
be waiting to see what i do next

what do you do next

be not you here to tell i

captain you be in a bad way
going over to discard
the match
wells fargo will not convoy gold
you
tried and failed and two man be
dead
the gold be piling up on the
post and you can not move it
you
post be undermanned
you want the
quartermaster at platte to replace
seventy uniform send to the freight
office at west rim city

the freight build burned down
with the uniform
i be not operating
a fire department and if i be
west rim city be sixty mile away

that do not concern i either

what do

the kill of two soldier

they be i man haven and i be
trying every way i know to find out
who murdered they

so will i

you will find it hard than you think
i do not know how you operate but
it be a dangerous job that can get
you killed

perhaps i can get some help from the
sheriff

you can forget he
he be a miserable
man that somebody be use to keep
the law a joke

you make it sound very difficult
why do not you just wrap up you flag
and take it back east with you

tell i how will i know what you be
do

i will let you know from time to time

that be very obliging of you

but i do not want to visit the army
post

then report to i through mrs
caslon
here
you can be a friend of she
husband
he owned the argus mine
and die last year
if that meet

thank you


to you good luck

what mine do the two soldier try
to convoy the gold from


i mine the argus

that bring i to a question i decided
not to ask


then i will answer it first
captain
iles have ask i to marry he

i can understand that


but you can not understand why captain
iles should be involved in the gold
business

i do now


it be not just mine
you must realize
there be a lot of gold from all over
the territory stored at the post
warehouse

how much


perhaps as much as half a million
in fact i have about fifty thousand
in i safe now

who be do all this


i do not know
that be the bad
part of it
not knowing

put down the glass
pat she shoulder
with casual
reassurance
i might find out


do not get into trouble

that be why i be here


i know but

do not worry about it
trouble and i
be old enemy
we understand each
other
goodnight


good luck

how about eating alone
be that a
bad habit too

just when you have to pay for it

it be only money
i have changed i mind since i left
here awhile ago
i do not want to
pick a fight or break the bank
or

what changed you mind

that be what i come back to find out

maybe it would be good if you find
another girl

no it would not
i look

that man in ape clthe could
he be charlie

no

he eye follow you around like a
couple of fly

they follow i to see that stranger
do not annoy i

only stranger

no one else would be so foolish

first you be beautiful
then i like
the way you sing and now you be a
woman of mystery
champagne

i do not want to be a stranger so
i will have to be foolish

you like to take chance do not you

if i feel lucky

then i would advise you to try the dice
table

i would rather get lucky here

every man have a right to go to his
own funeral

as the waiter set
down the champagne
and glass
i could be you cousin from
Waxahatchio
i could be cousin john
a missionary on he way to china

he seem to be a lot of man

the most in town

it be a very small town
he sip and gaze
around
you could get it all in this saloon

we usually do

so charlie probably run the town

why do you care

i be going to spend some time here
i
want to know who wind the clock

you ought to learn not to pick they
so easy like you do you cousin

ask she

mistake

bring he outside

what happen

misunderstand

he wanted to be i cousin
only i have not any aunt or uncle
but you never know and the least
i can do be bury he

mick will kill he

that be ten to one

i do not like the other fellow
chance but i be a sucker for odds

you should always bet on a champion
then you can only lose once

you give ten to one
i will take it

you be down
thousand to a hundred

do not miss so much
you will get tire

he can fight a little

little will not be enough

stand still and fight

you can not do this

nobody can do this
to i

somebody just do

i can not believe it

those thing can become very vague

and where do you expect all this to
get you

that be a question i prefer not to

authority too far

perhaps but there be one thing

butterfly

what do you think you will get out of
running the stage line

commission on all the gold i get

they do not need to when they shoot
so often

worry it over

Sumpin be not it

bandaged hand
but ah am

with you

not quite empty
i give you what be
probably the one honest feel you

i keep forget that
pardon i

what be the matter prince

i do not like john haven or anything
about he

you have say that

what do you know about he

you want i to have he look up in
the social register

man walk in out of nowhere

and go against you table
do he
play like a gambler

he know something

yes and he take mick

so he can fight
you like that part do not you

i will tell you one thing prince i
do not like this part

stand there a second

every time i see you you look
different but you always look
beautiful
why be that

i always have somebody to lie to i

take i hand
but do not squeeze it

tell i what you be do with i
buggy

i work
i be the new transportation
boss
you hired i

i presume you be going shop

i would not wear anything sell this
side of chicago
i be going to call
on a gentleman

at this hour

he name be mark bristow and any
hour it would be strictly business

the way you say it he may need a
lawyer

he be a lawyer himself but it will not
help he

no

what good be a lawyer if he never
get in a court

like a doctor in a graveyard
where
be this unlucky man

across the street
mark bristow lawyer

shall i take the horse back and rub
they down

do you think they have go far enough

i have not

then maybe you well wait and come
with i

i wonder if you would do i a favor


why surely

it be a big favor and i would not
blame you if you refused


what be it

i want to haul some gold from you
mine


that a big favor

i know it seem impossible to you
but that be one reason why i be here
to find cut what make it impossible


be not that very risky

that be why i could not go to anyone
but you


i be just wonder if we should not
speak to captain iles first

you know what he would say
she smile grimly
and nod
he would advise against it but if it
work i way it may clear everything
up for all of we and for iles
too
the war department do not like
all that gold around an army post

we be working too much in the dark
this may be the only way to see
something
it be a risk but someone
have to take it


who else will know of it

just we
Thatll be all who know
and that be the idea


i will arrange it

do not look so grim
it be only you
gold and i skin
and smile when you
walk away as though we would be talking
about what a dry summer it be be

you know i will always cooperate
as much as possible
but i have not
the money

rising and going to
the desk with a sheaf
of paper which she
place on he desk
these be i

you
s for gamble
they
add up to six thousand dollar
do
you want to count they

no

returning they to
she pocket
you credit over mark

i luck can turn can not it

not on i table

i have see other people fall in this
trap but i do not think it would
get i

nobody do
i will have prince drop
in and go over you book
maybe we
can work something out

but i told you

that be the way it be mark
i pay
off on the line and i expect to get
paid
give it some think


you know you remind i a little
back there of a character i once
read in a book

i have an idea you would read a book
what be the character

simon Legree

mark be mixed up
he be either crook
without be smart or honest without
be lucky
and that be no good

i do not think i would want to owe you
money even if i be honest

even

when i be seven i robbed i own
piggy bank

it be hard to imagine you be seven

i be very fat and eat a lot of candy

be that why you robbed you bank

no
i robbed it to run away from
home

do you do it

yeah but i have to go back

why

it get dark


this be i favorite place in the

the rook here and the stream
the
stream be always running away and

wonder which be the good

they probably envy each other

do you suppose any woman could envy
i

i know it

but not a good woman

nobody be any good
you mean
respectable

maybe

respectable people be very useful
but they bore i

with certain exception

like who

like mary caslon

i think we might get to that

how do you happen to know she

i know she husband

that be curious consider

consider what

ben caslon be a very upright citizen

mean i be not

she be certainly not hard to look at
and now she have the money and be
also very respectable

then why would she be interest in
i

because you be no good
and good
woman like man who be bad for they

flattery will get you nowhere

fool with she will get you nowhere
too except in trouble

how you could allow that scoundrel
to transport gold from you mine
when


the man you call a scoundrel may be
dead at this moment

and he may be in town at this moment
where in fact he be
how you could do this without telling
i


i only do it for you sake

after all mr
haven represent the
you

government

who do you think i represent


i told you george i be only trying
to help you

and while we be on the subject who
do mark bristow represent


you know perfectly well that he be i
lawyer

i know perfectly well he be a scoundrel
too

at the door a ball
of cold fire
thank you mary

i be sorry
i would say that i lost i
head if i believe that i have one


it be i fault george
mark left i something


you be not going to open it

to whom it may concern
that be what
it say here
well it may concern i

it do

i business be not jammed up enough
so they send this harebrained demoted
lieutenant pry around in it
they
want to help i too


george you be get to be a
hard man to deal with

i be get to deal with some hard
man


you certainly be a careful man

i have to be
i live a careless life

what about the deposition

she have it
it be in she safe

good

what do we do now

we call on charlie

it be a dangerous play haven

be it

what if she do not believe you

then she will have to believe you

that deposition could be a lie
it
might not stand up in a court

you be sure of that

well not exactly

that be it
you be a lawyer and you be
not sure
then how can she gamble on
it either

because she be a gambler

no she be not
we be the gambler mark
lots go


you be under arrest

for what

for the murder of james goddard
and robbery under arm

i have hear about you
you do not appear
to understand the function of you
office
taking sheriff gun
and breaking it open
you have missed the whole point of
you profession
even you gun be not loaded
haven load it as it
go on
i suggest that you start all over
again with this point in mind
the
duty of a peace officer be to arrest
the culprit of a crime not the
victim


rye

two

this be no good

the bourbon be just as bad

i do not mean that

you want to leave

i just do not like it
i be a nervous man
something going
to happen
i can feel it

that be right

then why do not we do something

we be do something

what

wait for something to happen

charlie want to see you
upstairs

see

do i go with you

can you make it

i see you find the difference

look like a board meet

what be he do with you

i think i might need a lawyer

i doubt it

i can realize how seldom legal
technicality annoy you but i
have one that might
besides he know all about it

about what

about a gear box i failed to deliver

i do not know anything
i merely

shut up

mark be right
he do not know
anything
he just know what i
dictated to he in a deposition

and what be that

it be just a story
about a man who
get murdered a thief who get shot
and a gear box that get lose
probably
nobody would believe it
unless i get killed for it

go downstairs pete
watch the
stairway

who else have you tell

no one
mark i have to have
he be a
witness and a notary
he make it
stick
he stand it up in court

always watch he
face
what keep it from get to a court

cut

he be running a bluff

i run one on you

you bring you lawyer
ask he if
this do not sound like blackmail

he can not think very clearly in the
presence of a gun

but it do not bother you

no it do not

what you want be money

i do not see how going to the law
will get it for you

if you do see how i would never get
there would i

i be afraid not

so it boil down to this
we can
make a deal and all be happy
together

not as long as you always have
something on we

unless you also have something on
i

and how would that be

when i deliver the gold to you

you mean the gear box

i can even forget i look inside
so i steal a gear box
i be still a
thief

what do he get

he get even with you

have you lost you mind

it be all right when he lost his
money

all right
i will give he the
iou
when the gear box be
deliver

you do not realize how important it
be when a piece of machinery break
down
it could close the entire
sawmill

i guess i do not realize it

i think that be all

you can stay

i think she be talking to i

you roll nice dice and you bet they
jamb up but some day you will slip
and when you do i will be around to
catch you

you know i think he will

then you should be more careful

the poorhouse be filled with careful
man
knocking out he
pipe
and so be the graveyard

you have get a nice perfume

carnation
she ruffle he hair
with she hand
i almost have to have you killed
i would
have hated it

so would i

i would have missed you
too much

and too long

do you ever tell a woman you loved
she

all of they

how do you get away

i be always in the doorway when i
said it

you never said it to i

let we go over to the doorway

i seem to always end up like this
with you
i take you for grant
you like it that way
it go with
load dice and crimp card and
fix wheel

be not that you business

it be not i life

you told i once you might be a
missionary on you way to china
and
that be as much as i have ever find
out about you
you be working for
i but for all i know you could be
working for somebody else

like goddard

why not

i think i well bring you that gold

haven

do not tell i you be still recruiting

yes we still want you
but this be
a little different

and how be that

captain iles have ask i to take
you into custody haven

you hear the man

good thing for you be to come along
haven

that be what i like the good thing
for i

very friendly with everybody be not
he
wells fargo detective and now
the army
how far can he go

exactly where he be headed now to
jail


the quartermaster at platte want
three swear statement before he will
replace those seventy uniform sir

dumb luck

you seem to have be living quite
an adventurous life

be that why i be under arrest

that be indefinite
i wanted to talk
to you

if you consult the army blue book it
might enable you to be more definite

curiously enough you get i into
the habit of reading myself
you be
quite right about the blue book
that officer should get himself
about onehalf as far out of line as
you have

how far be that

right here in you own statement

i see you do what i expect

you have get a man killed and mrs
Caslons gold stolen
be that far
enough

not quite

haven as far as i be concern
this deposition be good enough for
i
indicate the
deposition
i want these people arrested
this
be all the evidence we need

i need more

for what reason

for the reason i come here
to get
the murderer of two soldier not
to save somebody gold
that be a
mistake you make
i still do not know
who killed they but i be going to
find out
and when the net be haul
in they be all going to be in it
that be i fish and you can have
the minnow

when be you returning mrs
Caslons
gold

that be a matter between myself and
mrs
caslon

i do not particularly like you but
i see no reason why you should get
yourself deliberately killed

it will not be deliberate

what difference do it make how you
get killed
where do it leave i

where do it leave i

understand this haven
you be heading
for bad trouble and when it come
do not expect any help from i
be
that clear

from the begin

anything else sir

and a copy of that confounded blue
book


what be the good word

for you it be not good

where they cach it
i could not
haul it on horseback so i come here

to they
i wanted to buy a membership
in they club

you do
it very fast and you might be lucky

trying to pull himself
together
yes
i might be
i will try it

softly
turning to
the clerk
you do not throw away that verse

no

you will not have to change it much

you be not going out there with that

not much be it

you will never get closer to have
nothing

no i will not

say

i be naturally sentimental bein a
sort of poet

naturally

i keep a bunch of gimeracks an
oldtime sheriff gun a bullet from
a dead bandit a rosary from some
guy they hanged

that be nice
hobby

come on you
keep moving



where you guy going

you want they uniform out do not

i will tell you when

what you think you be do


that be all right
just barge right
in
i be going to tell you something

no you be not
you be going to
listen

you lost some uniform
you think
they be burned

they be

no they be not but they be now
because i just set fire to they

what be this

they be smoulder right now in the
warehouse at the sawmill and there
be about seventy man down there who
be ready to wear they

wear they
what for

what other reason
to get in the
post and take the gold from you

you be taking a detachment up north
on an indian scare

well that scare be a fake
ruse
so you know where to send they now

look here lieutenant

correction

major

you well get down to that sawmill
captain
they may try it anyway

i guess i owe you an apology

i will take it


i guess i owe you something too

only fifty thousand


i wish there be something i could
say or do

there be
you can give i back i
gun

and you can give this one back to
the sheriff


i will always remember what a fool i
make of myself

i always try to forget


be you going too

not with they


there be seventy man ready for any
kind of play
i say we can still
swing it and get out of town

can we

you wanted to give haven time
well
he take it

you well get out before he take
you

by that i presume you intend to
remain

i have be here as long as i remember

i ask you once if haven moved i
out
i think he be moved we both out
together

this be the way i wanted it
and
when i have finished you will too
as though haven have never be here

you because i an awful lot of trouble

yeh
but i finally bring you
something

you do not really think mark would
use it do you

maybe i just wanted to send you a
gun

maybe

be not it a little late to make any
difference

it be pretty late

why

i have to arrest you

for what

murder

i could have killed you from the
window but i do not
and i do not
kill the two man or Goodard

who do

maybe mick maybe prince who
know

you know

you would almost as soon be killed as
arrest i would not you

almost

which be you wells fargo or army

army

i guess it be i turn to wish you would
go to china

i wish i have too

if you still have that gold and i
think you do we might make it yet
you see i believe that every man have
he price

some man do not believe that

but every woman know it

only there would not be any woman on
i jury
and that be why you be not as bad off
as you might think
i could find
twelve man who might think you capable
of almost anything but i would not
bet they would vote that way after stare
at you through a trial
he note she eye go
past he
mick be dead for the murder and
prince can be hung for the rest of
it

it be no good

i will get someone

stay here

tell i something

sure

this get we all
this do not count

no

tell i something on the square

do you ever love i

all the time

tell it

from the first night and the first
time of the song
i tried to get
away from it but every time it come
back
every time i tried to get it
out of i brain i just push it
deeper into i heart
it have to be
either you or i

it be all right
i love you
