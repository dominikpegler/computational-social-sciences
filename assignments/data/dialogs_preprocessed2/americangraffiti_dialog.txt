full of gas just to make one circuit
it be really somethin


hey john

anything else you want
steve
steve shake his
head

if there be you let i know now
just honk and i be yours

one friesgrab it before i drop it

where be i

um how you think high school
romance be goofy and we start
going together just because you
think i be kinda cute and funny
but then you suddenly realized you
be in love with i it be
serious
and ah
oh you be
leadin up to something kinda big

you make it sound like i be giving
dictation
well seriously what i
mean be that ah
since we do
care for each other so much and
since we should really consider
ourselves as adult
now i ah
could i have a couple of those fry

come on Budda
come on

ah where be i

consider ourselves adult

right
right
anyway i think
maybe before i leave we could ah
agree that
that seeing other people
while i be away can not possibly hurt
you know

you mean dating other people

i think it would strengthen we
relationship
then we would know for
sure that we be really in love
not
that there be any doubt

i think you be right
i mean we be
not kid anymore and it be silly to
think that when we be three thousand
mile apart we should not be able to
see other people and go out

laurie now listen i do not ask
for that back
i think that

i know
i just sort of think it be
juvenile now
i will keep it at home
it be less conspicuous there

you do not want to wear it

i do not say that
i understand and
i be not upset
i mean i can not expect
you to be a monk or something while
you be away

and i have a really sharp record
collection
i even have pledge i
love by johnny ace
anyway how can
you love nelson when he be going out
with marilyn gator
since he dump
on you maybe we could

he do not dump on i you little
dip
