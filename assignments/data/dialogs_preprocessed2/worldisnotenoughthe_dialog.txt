former soviet union which as you know

it will not just be two week out of action

i need you to pass i fit now molly

it be just a scratch

james
it would not really be

ethical
can not we just skirt the issue

if you show sufficient
willpower
promise to slow down
cut out running
jumping
shoot
all kind of

strenuous activity

then maybe i would be
open to that

perhaps after this
test

yes

i could come for a second opinion

the money be dip in urea dried
and packed tight
in one note the metal
strip have be replace with a
combustible magnesium circuit in
effect a tiny detonator
king always wear
a pin in he lapel an heirloom called
the eye of the glen
but someone
switched it for a copy a ceramic micro
circuit emit an electronic signature

when he come within range of the money
boom
ingenious

we have be pawn in someone game
they
trick we into bringing the money to
king
not just elaborate
cocksure

and expensive
cost three million plus

cheap if it achieve you aim of de
stabilize the western world


what do you know of the caspian sea

caviar capital of the world
matchless
beluga
firm yet subtle
large landlock body of water on
earth
Oilrich
hitler wanted it
stalin beat he to it

and now it be up for grab a goldrush
far more oil than anyone think

late estimate six trillion dollar
it will make the gulf look like a puddle
see we right through the new century
the problem be get the oil out of
there

there be four pipeline in the works
three to the black sea shipping out
through the bosphorus
all vulnerable to
unstable government or russian blockade

so sir roberts go through turkey
direct to the med

huge project
the most expensive of the
pipeline but the one supported by every
western leader
none of the american oil
company be will to take it on
but king have connection to the region
he married into the Vavra family rich
local industrialist
he used those
connection to hold it all together

kill the man kill the pipeline

not necessarily
not with elektra taking
over

you call to the

we credibility have be hit hard
we
have to hit back harder
you
assignment

i be waiting for the report on you
medical


somehow managed to shoot two of she
captor and escape

the leader the one who escaped
can
you describe he

he shouted
he shouted all the time

he stare at it


tell i about the kidnap of elektra
king

who told you to look at Elektras file

i take the initiative

you have not be given an assignment in
this case

i be the one who bring that money
in

i be well aware of you stake in this

if you have a point get to it

the amount of money that killed robert
king be the same amount as the ransom
demand for elektra

whoever kidnap elektra be the same man
who killed she father

it be a message
he want we to know he be
back

who

claude Serrault




renard


sir robert tried to deal with the
kidnapping with he own
resource at
first
when Elektras ear be deliver
to he in the post he come to i
i advised against paying the ransom
i
know it be renard
i play it out as
long as possible to get a fix on he

sacrifice the girl to take out the
terrorist

how many death be he responsible for
how many innocent people
you may only
get one shoot at a man like renard
same
circumstance i would do the same again

we send down to kill he
before he
could elektra escaped
week later we
man caught up with the target
put a
bullet in he head
that bullet be still there

he survive

the doctor who saved he could not get it
out so renard killed he
when interpol
find the xray there be mild
jubilation
effectively he be a dead man

the bullet be moving through the medulla
oblongata killing off he sense of
touch
he feel no pain
he can push
himself harder longer than any normal
man

that which do not kill i make i
strong


now robert be dead
he get he revenge

he be not through yet
renard do not blow
up five million dollar unless he know
there be more coming in
he be working for
someone
someone who want to stop the
pipeline
and they hired the perfect
killer
one with a vendetta against
king
and you

i see the good doctor give you glow
testimonial
exceptional stamina

he be always be good at oral exam

get out to the pipeline
find the insider
who switched the pin
if you instinct
be right renard will be back
he have not
completed the job
the pipeline be still
going forward and we have elektra to
thank for that

rendezvous

excellent
evacuate miss king and the
other

you can evacuate i worker but i be not
going anywhere

fast
get we speed up

tactical fission device
low yield

the plutonium be miss
they have taken
the core

then it be no long a bomb

it be a bomb alright
we be still dead if
the trigger charge go off

let it blow

but we can stop it

let it blow

trust i
leave it

it be not nuclear
the bomb be a dud

and she think she get away with it

what the hell be you talking about

it be part of some plan

who be she

be you insane
this be
she pipeline

make she look even more innocent

what would she want with weapon grade
plutonium

i be hope you could tell i

you steal an old bomb small by today
standard about the size of the one that
destroyed nagasaki take the plutonium
core out of it intend to use it
to make a big good bomb

this be
i ass

tanner to do you read

loud and clear

the west

what be do bond
trying to impress
this innocent thing

she be no innocent
this be i nuclear
consultant

ah i see
purely
plutonic
relationship

really bond could not you find a nice
russian scientist with hair growing out
of he ear

what be you business with elektra king

i think you be the one in she
business

she drop a million and half dollar to
the house you house
and you do not
even bat an eyelid
she be paying you
off
what for

as ever you be the spy who have to see a
plot wherever he look

that be dollar of beluga ruined

you be out of you league
she be
working with renard

they have stolen a nuclear device

tell we what you know Zukovsky
tell
we before it too late

now
where be we

rope

no
the truth
she think i be dead those blade
be mean for you
what do you know
that she would kill you for

i do not know what you be talking

help i do not let i drown

you be in this thing up to you neck

alright alright
sometimes i smuggle
machinery for she
russian stuff

and the payoff on the table

special job

a
a submarine

what

to haul some cargo
i nephew he be
captain of a sub in the black sea fleet

where be the sub go

no
get i out

this be too big for even you
where be
it

this be a family matter
if i nephew be
in danger we do it i way or nothing
now get i out

no
bond

bond

commander bond you be dangerous
unpredictable and a hothead

but then again explosive device be i
specialty

so
i way
no no interpol
just
you i and i people

where

istanbul


so beautiful
so smooth so warm

how would you know

why be you like this
because bond be
dead
it be what you wanted

of course

he be a
good lover

what do you think

nothing

what about this

nothing

but surely

you can feel this

remember
pleasure



any luck reaching yevgeny

negative comrade

what be this place

former surveillance post
the dye
factory be just a front
now it turn a
good profit

you old friend dmitri

today you be glad to have the boa on
you side

in the good old day the have three
or four spot where we submarine could
surface without anyone knowing
but
yevgeny be suppose to be loading cargo

what class sub do you nephew run

Cclass

nuclear

not just nuclear
power by a nuclear
reactor
he be not loading any cargo
they want the
sub
the sub itself
put weapon grade plutonium inside the
subas reactor
instant catastrophic
meltdown

make to look just like an accident

mother of god

the right kind of explosion in the right
spot it would block the bosphorus cut
off the black sea

but why
eight million people would die
the land irradiate for a hundred year
cloud of radiation the size of
europe

because an explosion like that would kill
all the other pipeline
there would be
only one way to get the oil out of the
caspian and pump it to the world

the king pipeline

elektra would control it all

if what you say it true
it may be too
late for yevgeny


captain

sir
we be ready to load you cargo
we only have a few hour before we will be
missed

you come with a skeleton crew

that be all we can afford these day

of course
we be grateful for you
effort

we have brandy and other refreshment for
you man

if we be not in time and something have
happen to he
you must let i kill
they

whoever get there first Zukovsky
they
have


take they up and throw they in the sea

we will be underway in two hour
use that
time to refamiliarize yourselves with
you station
then ponder how rich
you will be
the rebreathers for the
escape be already on board


now you know how it feel
to be locked
away to wonder if they be coming for
you if anyone will ever come for you

someone will come

who
bond
bond be dead

somehow i find that strangely
disappoint

elektra
what time be it

time for you to die

the reactor be secured

this be the end

no
it be the begin
the world will
never be the same

it will be yours and yours alone
have
fun with it


comrade it be faint but i be get
something
signal
transmit at

degree north

the locator card
it be

the rest

forty fortythree degree east

the maiden tower

how appropriate

i would hear there be some renovation
there
no one would look for a sub in
that place in a million year

Zukovsky

if i do not get to the boa before he get
to maiden tower be dead

for year i be tell i could never take
the great james bond and he walther
what good be you gun now bond

they be digging near here and they
find some very pretty vase
they also
find this
i think we ignore the old way at we
peril do not you

where be

soon she will be everywhere

all this because you fell for renard

five more turn and you neck will break

since i be a child i have always have a
power over man
when i realized i father
would not rescue i from the kidnapper i
know i have to form a new alliance

you turned renard

just like you
only you be even
easier

i told he he have to hurt i he have to
make it look real
when he refused i told
he i would do it myself

so you killed you father

he killed i the day he
refuse to pay i ransom

be this all about the oil

it be i oil
mine and i family

it run in i vein thick than blood
i be going to redraw the map
and when i be through the whole world
will know i name i grandfather name
the glory of i people

noone will believe this meltdown be an
accident

they will believe
they will all
believe

you understand
nobody can resist i

strangle

elektra it be not too late

she

in case you have forgotten
i be dead
already

have not you hear the news
so be she

you will die for this

the cover be off the reactor

he be sealed himself in

he be going to insert the plutonium

do you know what you be do

like riding a bike

what kind of bike do you ride

just wanted to put he on edge

open the torpedo tube

climb

keep moving

there be one chance

Rebreathers

never liked those thing anyway

count to twenty
when you get to twenty
open the hatch
it can only be open
for a few second or we will sink

but what if

count to twenty
i will be there

one one thousand two one thousand

fourteen one thousand fifteen one
thousand

twenty

christmas

we have to get the rod out of the
reactor

melt down
degree the
zirconium casing on the rod crack
the plutonium melt
in ten
minute a hydrogen explosion


she be waiting for you

we be sink

help i
we have to seal it

we have get to get out

we can not
