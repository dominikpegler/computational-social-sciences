this be unacceptable
come on you bloody bastard


where do you want go first for
foreign investment

where the money be
america
england saudi arabia



do you see all the old apartheid
flag
it be a disgrace

it be also a constitutional right

along with the apartheid anthem
i
know
but it be time people moved
on




look at that
the white be
cheering for the springbok the
black be cheering for the lion

we do that on the island you
know
we supported anyone but the
bok
it really irritated the
warder

of course it do




how long until the world cup

about a year

plenty of time for improvement


mr
president i would not get i
hope up
we be a damn disgrace

i want to go to india and
indonesia too

sorry i be late

how be it going

very badly

maybe it be just as well

why

bending close talk

i have just be at a meet of the
national sport council executive
there be strong support to drop the
springbok emblem and color
altogether
if they be playing badly maybe it
a good time to make a change
with barely hide



this could be the last time we have
to look at the green and gold




francois Pienaars team come to
loftus versfeld stadium this
afternoon unprepared and arrogant


they left minute later with
they tail between they leg
like whipped mongrel
and i for one be glad
not
because we lost but because
there be now no way to disguise the
fact that we be completely and
utterly unprepared to reenter the
world of topnotch international
rugby


the rugby world cup be now less
than a year away and i for one
be relieve that we be the host
nation and therefore qualify
automatically for the tournament
because i be not sure we would get
in on merit alone

who get the axe
someone have to



Pienaars team play without
discipline without strategy and
without courage

he be trying to get they to drop i

he be just bitter because the
springbok be boycott when he
play

maybe but people listen to what he
say


they bring shame upon we nation
and i for one can say without
fear of contradiction that today
these fifteen socalled man do not
deserve to wear the hallowed green
and gold

here you muti
i warm the
milk tonight

you be too good to i

you daughter called to cancel she
visit this weekend


do she say why

no she do not
she said to tell you she be sorry

do you need anything else tonight

no thank you
i be going to bed
good night

good night Madiba
sleep well





no pushing now
there be enough for
everybody



god bless you


you be a very lucky boy
it be a
real springbok practise jersey
it be a bit big but it be warm and
it will last for ever


it be yours take it
go on


why will not he take it


if he wear it the other will
beat he up


because the springbok be playing
so badly


no
because for they the
springbok still represent
apartheid



and now for the next item on
we agenda

the executive propose a full
membership vote on the follow
motion

that as a prominent symbol of
the apartheid era the color
emblem and name of the springbok
be eliminate immediately

and that all sport team
representing south africa shall be
known forthwith as the Proteas

we will submit this motion to a
hand vote


in the event of a close count we
will go to a written ballot
the moment he be be






both unit to the car right now


what do i tell the japanese trade
delegation

i delegate that decision to you

do you want i to inform the

no

we should at least include the
minister of sport

no

i strongly advise against do
this
especially on you own
it
it give the impression of
autocratic leadership

you risk alienating you cabinet
and you party

you advice be duly noted barbara


Madiba
the people want this
they hate the springbok
they
do not want to be represent by a
team they cheer against all they
live

yes i know
but in this instance
the people be wrong
and it be i
job as they elected leader to make
they see that

can you tell the boy that Madiba
want to go to Eersterust very
fast

you be risking you political
capital
you be risking you
future as we leader

the day i be afraid to do that be
the day i be no longer fit to lead

at least risk it for something more
important than rugby



and in concluding this historic
conference


brother sister comrade we
in the executive applaud you
diligence and courage



brother sister
join we in
we anthem

Nkosi Sikelel iAfrica etc god
bless africa


brother sister member of the
choir we would only interrupt
such beautiful music for something
truly important
in this case for
someone truly important
please welcome president mandela

smile

brother sister comrade i be
here because i feel strongly that
you make a decision today without
sufficient information or
foresight


i be aware of you early vote
i
be aware that it be unanimous
nonetheless i propose that we
restore the springbok
restore
they name they emblem and they
color immediately

let i tell you why

on robben island in pollsmoor
prison i jailer be all
afrikaner
for twenty seven year i studied
they
i learned they language i
read they history i read they
poetry
i have to know i enemy in
order to prevail against he
and we prevail do we not
all
of we here
we prevail

we enemy be no long the
afrikaner
they be we fellow
south african we partner in
democracy

and they treasure springbok rugby
if we take that away we lose they
we prove that we be what they
feared we would be
we have to be good than that


we have to surprise they with
compassion with restraint and
generosity

yes i know
all the thing they
deny we

but this be not the time to enjoy a
momentos petty revenge
this be
the time to build we nation use
every single brick available to we
even if that brick come clothed
in green and gold

you elected i
you elected i to be you leader
let i lead you now
who be with i on this

who be with i



twelve vote
twelve

luxury
all we needed be one
more yes than no

what if you have not get it

well as you know i be an obedient
party member

i be sorry Madiba but we have get
problem everywhere we look
housing food job crime we
currency
you can not keep
interrupt affair of state to
placate a minority

but i must
this minority still
control the army the police and
the economy
without they we
cannot address the other problem


so this rugby it be just a
political calculation

it be a human calculation
if we take away what they cherish
the springbok they national
anthem we just reinforce the
cycle of fear between we

i will do what i must to break this
cycle
or it will destroy we



this beer taste like kuk

it be not the beer


take another
everybody take a beer

toast

to the taste of defeat

drink it
remember it

promise yourself never to taste it
again

you be right

springbok

Aangename kennis Mevrou brit


ek ook Meneer
shall i pour sir

no thank you i think i would like to

how do you take you tea francois

milk and sugar please


the english have given we many
thing including rugby but
afternoon tea be one of the
great

thank you sir

you have a very difficult job

i do
i sell gas braais

captain of the springbok
very
difficult job

not compare to yours sir

ah but then nobody be trying to
tear i head off while i be do
mine

it be not so difficult to get
people to do they good
and i
imagine that anybody who play for
they country do they good
almost automatically

or they would not be chosen in the
first place

yes
but to get people to be
well than that


well than they think they can be
now that be difficult i find

yes sir it be

how do we do that
by example
to
an extent
but there be more to it
than that
searching for the right

inspiration perhaps

how do we inspire ourselves to
greatness when nothing less will
do
how do we inspire everyone
around we
sometimes i think by use the
work of other

on robben island when thing be
very hard i find inspiration in a
poem

poem

victorian poem
just word
but
they helped i to stand when all i
wanted be to lie down
but you do not come all this way to
hear an old man talk about thing
that make no sense

no
they make a lot of sense sir
on the day of a big match say a
test in the bus on the way to the
stadium nobody talk


yes
yes
everybody be
preparing

when i think we be ready i have
the bus driver put on a song i have
chosen
a theme song
one we all
know
we listen together and
it help

yes
i remember when i be a guest
at the olympic game in
barcelona
the whole stadium
welcome i with a song
at the time the future we
future seem very bleak
but
to hear that song in voice from
all over we planet
it make i
very proud to be south african
it
helped i to come home and do
well
it allowed i to expect
more of myself

may i ask what the song be sir

well it be Nkosi Sikelel
iAfrika
very inspire song

we need inspiration francois

because in order to build we
nation we all need to exceed we
own expectation


yes sir
we probably do



so

hm

what be he like

he be
he be not like anyone i have ever
meet before


well
what do he want

Ag come on francois
it be like
talking to a bloody brick wall
what do he want

i think
i think he want we to win the
world cup


excuse i



what do you think

it do not matter what i think

yes it do

okay
i think he look like one of
the policeman who forced we out of
we house when you be in jail
i
do not like seeing you shake his
hand
and i be not the only one

you criticize without
understand
you seek only to
address you own feeling
this be
selfish think
it do not
serve the nation

wait

no one have claim responsibility
yet but authority say that the
time and target mark this as the
work of white rightwing fanatic
an act of revenge for the
killing in waco texas

apparently a simple mixture of
commonly available industrial and
agricultural material

that be all we need


homemade explosive from material
every boer already have

so far the official death toll
stand at over a people which
include at least child from
a day care center in the federal
build

please call president clinton for

what be i suppose to do

what you do best



let rip


let we do we good

go get they

who here know the first rule of
rugby

i

what be it

only hit the other player when the
ref be not looking

no
the first rule of rugby be you
can only pass the ball backwards or
sideways

if you drop the ball or pass it
forwards you scrum for possession
this be a scrum
you kick forwards


if you kick it out of bound you
throw it back in to a lineout
this be a lineout
you score in four way
a try
when you dot the ball down behind
the try line
that be five point
another two point when you
convert the try by kicking the ball
through the upright
three point for a penalty kick
three point for a drop kick
have you get all that

no

agh bugger it let we just run and
pass
whoever drop the ball do
pushups

okay
who want to scrum against
i



and in addition to the
nationwide campaign we propose
that all retail outlet charge a
nominal fee for plastic bag

mr
minister please forgive i
this sound excellent and we will
return to it but if you will indulge
i for just one minute

you see that picture be worth any
number of speech



tell i something how do this
help they win rugby match





this be boland botha coming to you
live from cape town airport

where the springbok flight have
just landed




the green and gold have one week to
put the finishing touch to they
gruelling train program



and i for one have to admit to
be cautiously excite


i say cautiously because in i
humble opinion

this team have be overtrained
on the field and overcommitted
off it


which make beating a powerhouse
australian side in the cup opener
next week a tall order especially
since this be an inexperienced team
with a history of coming up short
in big match
this be boland


around the world objectively
what be they saying about we
chance against australia

everyone think they will beat we
and if they do we will have to go
through england and the all black
just to get to the final

so it be very important that we
beat australia
thank you

it be a new international record
they beat scotland to in the
quarter final
you see the match

close
they seem unstoppable

if oppose team play they

other free
and also there be the business of
the haka


they maori war dance

expectation
on and off the
field

it be not enough

this country be hungry for
greatness



how be the feel in the dressing
room

nobody give we a bloody chance
i
like that
it play into they one
weakness

hey do not worry man
i already
know you be crazy


morning boy

morning Madiba

what be it

Linga have an idea sir




now you have do it



the ticket sold out long before
the team become so popular
so
it be not exactly going to be the
rainbow nation out there
that be
the reality
the president will greet the
player before the match he will
present the trophy after the match
he will be exposed to people
twice
he will be on live all
over the world
express he deep

all it take be one idiot trying to
make a statement or one crazy fool
who think he hear god speaking to
he over the radio


it be happen before
but not today
not on we watch
not today


face flag

bugger off



we be at ellis park on this
historic day where even this
early crowd excitement be at fever



because they beloved green and
gold have somehow managed to exceed
all expectation





but now they come up against a team
that be unlike any other they have
play




these all black be possibly one
of the great international side
ever with a player in jonah Lomu
who be as dominant as any this
correspondent have ever see




to lose to they be no disgrace
to
lose to they in the final be in
fact an honor




i say this with absolutely no
negativity
i simply want to save
people from the heartbreak of
unrealistic expectation



so take a reality check sit back
and share an afternoon with one
billion fellow fan around the
world
and as you do feel a
special pride in have make it
this far
this be boland botha
signing off and sitting back at
ellis park

control of the aircraft


i assume full responsibility for
what happen from now on

duly noted

of a case of wine

extra time
twenty minute

i do not think i can take it



who be the fit team on this
field

francois


how long before the end

seven minute

amazing support of these
south african

south african today

african

they be waiting for you over there
