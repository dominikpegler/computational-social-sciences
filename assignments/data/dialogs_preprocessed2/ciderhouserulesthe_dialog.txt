in other part of the world young
man of promise leave home to make
they fortune battle evil or solve
the problem of the world



i be myself such a young man when
i come to save the orphanage in st
cloud
many year ago



here in st
cloud i have come to
understand that promise be rarely
keep that the battle be not so much
against evil as ignorance and that
be successful can not hold a candle
to be of use



nor have i solve the problem i come
here to solve



even in the most enlighten time
unwanted baby will manage to be
born
that there will always be
orphan be simple not a problem to
be solve
here be st
cloud we
do not regard the sordid fact of
life as problem



in truth we have only have one real
problem



he name be homer wells

i named he after the greek writer
you know homer of course

i make he name wells because i
could tell he be very deep



in truth nurse angela named he
she father drill well and
homer be one of she family
umpteen cat

good night you prince of maine
you king of new england


there be something wrong with he
he
never make a sound



he do not cry enough for they if
you can believe it

do you think we could have a look at
someone a little different



thus be homer wells return
he
be too happy a baby



the second family have an unfortunate
gift for get sound out of homer



the rumor be true
they beat he
he could not stop crying



here be st
cloud i try to
consider with each rule i make or
break that i first priority be an
orphan future



easier say than do



i told the third family to take good
carethis be a special boy



it be homer who take too much good
care of himself

do not be frighten
everyone be
nice here

do you live here

i just belong here



what could i do with he
he keep
coming back

homer if you be going to stay at
st
cloud i expect you to be of
use



but in failing to withhold love
have i created a true and everlasting
orphan
i have be too successful
with homer wells
i have managed to
make the orphanage he home



god forgive i
i have make an
orphan by loving he too much
homer
wells will belong to st
cloud
forever

turn he face to they as he freeze to
death and see no help or pity in
all the glitter multitude


more

since you be the one who be smart
enough to read

uncharacteristically
blunt
stop it homer

reason to read they

okay



good night you prince of maine

lucky one

you want to fight about it


you pickin more cider apple then
anythin else
they drop be good
only for cider
and you pickin the
stem with the apple only half the
time
they good only for cider too
if you do not pick they stem
the rule be you want to pick the apple
with the stem homer
and see
here

above the stem
that be the bud for
next year applethat be called
the spur
you pick the spur you

hand you get homer
they hand you
get they know what they be do
be not that right

wally said to say hello


oh
that be
nice

wally said the most spectacular hit
be in the oil field at Yenangyat

movie outside

yes
but it be closed all the time
now because of the blackout

people watch the movie in they
car

when they watch at all
do you
like movie

yes
i have only see one though

you have see only one movie
which
one

king kong
it be really good

i have not see king kong since i
be a kid

that be a pie apple wilbur
homer
said you be not suppose to eat it

so he be an apple expert be he

oh i yes
this be a far superior
tasteand crisp too
you know so
many apple be disappointingly mealy
i wonder of most of the apple in i
life be not mean for pie

wilbur he picked they for we
himself

you do not find it depressing that
homer wells be picking apple

or that he can not be bothered to write
we a proper letter
dissertation
on apple we do not need

he probably do not make much money
picking appleshe must have have to
pay to send they too

i would not worry edna that he
do not have money
if he get hungry
he can pick he dinner

wilbur it be a gift
how can you
be angry with homer for sending we a
gift

i will show he a gift
i will give
he a gift he can use

but you look as if you liked it

i do like it
all i said be
it be not king kong


first she loved he then she do not
then no one else could have he

she do love he
how many woman have you known

and what do she die of exactly

she be torn apart
she die of a
break heart

oh sure

what be the medical explanation

well she be in a weakened
condition
i do not know
what about king kong
be that medically possible

at least king kong know what he
wanted

what be you do with that candy
homer

imitate mr
rose
he be makin history i suppose

you be not gettin in no trouble i
hope

no trouble

that Candyshe be the nice girl i
know

she be about the most beautiful girl
i ever seenI do not know if she be
the nice

she be the nice and the most
beautiful girl i have ever known

that sound like you be in trouble
already homer


that be rightthat sound like trouble
to i

i be not in trouble

yeah you be
i know when people be
in trouble and you be



he name be homer wells

and he pathetic resume be the
best i have see
though i find it
hard to believe the board would be
interest in this character


but he look like an excellent young
man a firstrate candidate

he look like a bleedingheart
missionary moron to i but that be
going to be the problem with any
doctor interest in coming here


do you know he

no
i do not want to know he
he be
do missionary workin india
i write he week ago but he be
either too holy or too busy to answer
maybe he get killed in the war


i fail to see how someone courageous
enough to make a commitment to a
foreign mission be automatically to
be dismissedthat part of the world
require precisely the kind of
dedication that be needed here

do it snow in bombay
one winter
here and we will be shipping he south
in a coffin


you can not think that a man who have
serve under such condition as
exist over there will be in the
slight daunt by a little snow
have you no idea how harsh and
primitive and full of disease that
part of the world be

then i suppose we can look forward
to catching various disease from
he


but dr
larch he seem exceptionally
qualify

i be not talking about he medical
qualification
it be the christian
thing that bother mei just do not
see it be of much use around
here


i fail to see how a little
christianity could hurt anyone
here

anyway i be just showing you this
guy as an example of what be available
i do not think you would be interest


we be very interest


yes very


you would not be opposed to meet
with he

i suppose it would not hurt to meet
he
what be he name again

dr
homer wells

i just hope he will not expect we to
say grace all the time


it be a nice name very new england


very maine a very localsounding
name

very

i just wanted to ask you

edna
come dance with i
let we be
foolish tonight

do he know he be suppose to be
in india
do he even want to
come back

hold he there
