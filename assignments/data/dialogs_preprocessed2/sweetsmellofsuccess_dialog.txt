mr
falco let it be say at once
be a man of face not one
none too pretty and deceptive
see that grin
it be the charming
street urchin face
it be part of
he helpless act he throw
himself on you mercy
i skip the
plead nervous bit that sometimes
blend over into bluster
the
moist grateful eye be a favorite
face with he it frequently tie
in with the act of boyish candor
he be talking straight from the
heart get it
he be get about
halfadozen face for the lady
but the real cut one to i be the
quick dependable chap nothing he
will not do for you in a pinch
at
least so he say
tonight mr
falco whom i do not invite to sit
at this table be about to show in
he last and most pitiful role
pale face with tongue hanging out
in brief gentleman and jersey
lilly the boy sitting with we be a
hungry press agent and fully up to
all the trick of he very slimy
trade

match i sidney

not just this minute


i know that loafer of yours open
at the latin quarter next week
say goodbye lester

may i ask a naive question mr
falco
exactly how do a press
agent work

why do not you answer the man
Sidalee
he be trying to take you
off the hook

you just have a good example of it
press agent eat a columnist
dirt and be expected to call it
manna

what be manna

heaven dust

but do not you help columnist by
furnish they with item

sure columnist can not get along
without we
only we good and
great friend

forget to
mention that
we furnish he with
item

what some cheap gruesome gag

you print they do not you

yes with you client name
attached
that be the only reason
those poor slob pay you to see
they name in i column all over
the world
now as i make it out

and you should not be see with he
in public
because that be another
part of a press agent life he
dig up scandal among prominent man
and shovel it thin among the
columnist who give he space

there be some allusion here that
escape i

we be friend harvey we go as
far back as when you be a fresh
kid congressman do not we

why do everything you say sound
like a threat

do not threaten friend harvey
but why furnish you enemy with
ammunition
you be a family man
someday with god will you may
want to be president

you have do to she

and what have i do to she
besides not buy she a new fur coat
lately
sidney you be right
the boyo a dilly

why
because i do not like the way
you toy with human live
you
contempt and malice
because i
will not be the accomplice of you
sick ego and the way it be cripple
susie
you think of yourself
you and you column you see
yourself as a national glory
but
to i and thousands of other like
i you and you slimy scandal
you phony patriotics to i mr
Hunsecker you be a national
disgrace

son i do not fancy shooting
mosquitoe with elephant gun
so
suppose you just shuffle along and
call it a day

but i day with susie be not over
yet and

Tenll get you fifty you be playing
hookey from a pad cell

you do it

you do it good

you in a mood susie to run over
to Milgrims later and buy a few
new frock

no
i be going home

want sidney to drive you over

drive susie home

susie
i
i would have to take it
very much amiss if you ever see
that boy again

i will never see he again

call van cleve
tell he he be
right
tell he i said the dallas
boy be not worthy of he club

mary
for Susies own good
do not
give she misplace sympathy

i will get you a cab

get away from i



ask i to drive you over
and

i told you to leave
i do not know
if Stevell ever talk to i again
and i be ready to blame it all on you

susie


so that be what integrity look
like
well i be always will to
learn
how be that slob DAngelo you
uncle

i mother sideher brother
that remind i

susie look
run down
she can stand a vacation
and so can you
people say oh
the great

he be make of
iron
but you can use a rest guy

what be you so chipper about
if
i put a cross on every one of you
mistake you would look like a
graveyard

but not for anything i do today

sidney i know human nature
susie
lie to i she will see that boy
again

you be right

she will not give
he up but it do not matter
because the real money ball be
the boy not susan
and if

mr
Hunsecker this be to be
deliver to you personally

these drink be warm

you said you like to have they on
you table

what be you a critic

i will change

forget it
the real money ball be the boy

yeah the boy
we be on the verge
of a farce a real farce
as i see
it if susie have stand behind he
today he might have prove a threat
but since primarily he be wed to
he work he be not going to be able
to take it

stop tinkering pal that horse
radish will not jump a fence

in brief

it be all over
because any hour now the boy will
give she up
be it a farce or not

this syrup you be giving out
sidney you pour over waffle not


Hunsecker
what do you mean
that lousy kid will give up i
sister

be you listening

how do it matter who be sister
the main thing they be through
and

be i suppose to forget how that
boy talk to i today



be he worthy of a second
glance from a man like you
be he
i mean

brief epitaph
the boy be talking
when he should have be listening

bite on this

steamship ticket

for the next sail of the mary
Susans run down she be never be
abroad and as you so cogently put
it i be not make of iron

that be good
now that louse be
outa Susies hair for good

i want that boy taken apart

why do something that would drive
they right back into each other
arm
not to mention that this
time susie would know who shoot the
arrow

she know now

why give she real proof
you
nearly ruined she with she first
husband and you be right


but she almost follow he
out the window
what do you want
a chronic invalid

i know how to handle susie
you
just handle the boy sidney
preferably tonight

why what be tomorrow a holiday

i think i will go home maybe i left
i sense of humor in another suit

you have get that Godgiven brain
learn to use it
do you think it be
a personal matter with i this boy
be you telling i i see thing in
term of personal pique
do not you
see that today that boy wipe his
foot on the choice on the
predilection of sixty million man
and woman of the great country
in the world
if you have any
moral yourself you would
understand the immorality of that
boyo stand today
it be not i
he criticized it be i reader

i be leaving


do not remove the gangplank sidney
you may want to get back on board

this crab gumbo terrific



it be one thing to wear you
dog collar
but when it get to be
a noose
i would rather have i freedom

the man in jail be always for
freedom

except if you will excuse i i be
not in jail

sure you be in jail sidney
you be a prisoner of you own
fear of you own greed and
ambition
you be in jail



if you be trying to

you little boy do not know who you
be
talking around corner with
the big shot ten dollar dinner
fourteen suit and cashmere coat
you tell yourself that be who you
be
later you will not know who you
be without a penthouse on upper
park
but underneath it all
rat around from day to day you
know who you be
you be a
fearful ignorant nobody a poor
wop kid from the slum of philly
hope nobody else find it out

little hunch occur to i you
