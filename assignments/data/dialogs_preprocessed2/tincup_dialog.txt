the dull of a
love song sporadic from
and an occasional random as we



out west where the sun descend gloriously over desolate
mountain
sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
if you ignore the of the the of the
the the
and something else

garrulous with drink fraternity and
amusement
we


man be on the roof wrestling with a rickety
satellite dish string wire trying to get it to work
we get glimpse of he throughout the scene as he
struggle with what be assuredly a pirate operation

four of six floodlight nail to the roof cast pool of
yellow into the gather darkness
McAVOY
stand under the swarm of moth crowding the bright
light hitting golf ball

really into the deepen night
there be a beer between
he leg
behind he
group of man form a semicircle facing away from tin
cup
these man be the range regular

and
each man have money in one hand and he
prefer libation in the other
they be all looking
back and forth between the bug light hung on the back
wall and muttering what sound like bet to
a small man he stand at the center of
the group with a handful of cash

bookie and fulltime drive range man
born across the
river in mexico romeo be tin cup caddie confidante

the loser

negative as they turn back to romeo and the action at the
bug light

tin cup hold court

take about two ounce of brain
to figure it out

of brain in it

reveal the heft of they brain

for chrissakes boy
little
selfconfidence from the player
gallery

the pot go to whoever solve the
riddle

cup


dewey
i be the one asking the
riddle

answer

although
we could say if i get
to five hundred bounce and no one
get the riddle i get the pot
and i know what you be think
it be an impossible riddle
well

doctor look at he and say i

father do not sneak back in

he be still at the other
hospital

no
one beamed he aboard
that eliminate the most plausible theory in they mind
the man think hard

well
if the father married the
sones daughter

it be a family riddle earl
think
clean thought

the regular puzzle some more

give we a little hint



the doctor a woman
all head turn to take in the arrival of

standing just inside the door she be a freshfaced
beauty in she early thirties and she be get all new
everything the sport of golf require
new bag new
club new shoe new clothes new visor
she look
like she stepped out of an ad in golf digest
and all
the man be asking themselves the same question
what be
she do here
the silence invite molly to supply the
riddle answer

the doctor be the sones mother
feminist pose the riddle to
reveal how deeply we sexual
stereotype run
i take it you be a feminist
tin cup miss the ball he be be bouncing breaking the
spell
the regular wait for tin cup response

madam i have be called a lot of
thing but no one ever
saddle i with that one

you might try be saddle
sometime the smell of leather
the sting of a whip
the regular snicker enjoy she oneupmanship

slightly taken
aback
i be just a humble golf pro

you be roy mcavoy the golf pro
i
pictured something
different
i have a seven of the clock lesson

i think i have a doctor Griswold

at seven
they hurry out to the range tin cup oblivious to his
gaffe
and the regular gather to look out the window

to the range where molly be stretching and tin cup be
discreetly waving to the regular to get lost



the lesson begin
tin cup can be slightly condescending
in these situation though she be get he a little wary

the first thing you get to learn
about this game doc be it be not
about hitting a little white ball
into some yonder hole
it be about
inner demon and selfdoubt and
human frailty and overcome all
that crap
so
what kinda
doctore you say you be

i be a psychologist in layman
term call i a neoJungian post
modern freudian holistic
secularist

damn
she begin unpack one of she bag pulling out every
golf gimmick on the market swing aid strap to pull
you elbow together a ball pendulum that hang from
you hat a metal contraption for you foot etc

inner demon and human frailty be
i life work
i used to
practice in el paso but i have moved
here now

what be those

i ordered these from the golf
channel

he stare in disbelief as she try to wriggle into some
of this stuff
he be enchant and dismay

that stuff a waste of money

i be sure there be excess and
repetition here but i believe in
the gather of knowledge and i
figure well there must be some
truth about the golf swing
illustrated by these device
and that you would help i sort
through it
she stand there with contraption coming from every
limb

i have dozens of golf videotape
too
and a golf watch

take it off
all of it
now
you be a smart woman for
chrissake do not you know the
work of charlatan when you see
it
she deposit all the golf gimmick device in a pile

no
i can always tell when
someone be lying to himself but
i be quite susceptible and
frequently wrong when that person
lie to i
pointing to the
pile of device
that stuff cost i over
dollar

then it be dollar of shit
he tee a ball hand molly she driver and step back

go ahead
take a swing
molly take a pittypat swing and whiff and mutter
under she breath with the ease of a longshoreman


aw fuck

well you talk like a golfer
molly unload a mighty second swing
the club head
bounce off the mat
the ball sit untouched

shit

fuck
shit
these be
highly technical golf term and
you be use they on you first
lesson this be promise

awright wise ass show i
tin cup take the club from molly motion for she to
step back tee up a ball and rocket a drive into the
night

something like that
he hand she back the club and tee up another ball
molly just look at he

impressive
know i tend to
process thing verbally
can you
break down into word how you do
that
tin cup take a deep breath this be he speech

what be the golf swing
by
roy mcavoy
the golf swing be a poem

sometimes a love sonnet and
sometimes a Homerian epic it be
organic and of a piece yet it
break down into elegant stanza
and quatrain
the critical
open phrase of this song be the
grip in which the hand unite to
form a single unit by the simple
overlap of the small finger
hold lightly a conductor

baton
lowly and slowly the clubhead be
pulled back lead into position
not by the hand but the body
which turn away from the target
shifting to the right side without
shift balance
tempo be
everything perfection unobtainable
as the body coil now to the top
of the swing in profound equilibrium
and then a slight hesitation a nod
to the god

nod to the god

to the god yes
that he be
fallible
as the weight shift
back to the left pulled now by
power inside the earth it be
alive this swing a live
sculpture and down through
contact always down into terra
firma striking the ball crisply
with character a tuning
fork go off in you heart you
ball such a pure feel be
the wellstruck golf shot and
then the follow through to finish
always on line the reverse
of the golden bear the steelworker
power and brawn of carl Sandburgs
arnold palmer the da vinci of
hogan the unfinished symphony of
roy mcavoy

what
what be unfinished

i have a short follow through
i swing can look unfinished

why

some say it be because that be the
good way to play through the wind
of west texas
and some say it be
because i never finish anything
you can decide
the point be every
finishing position be unique as if
that be the signature left to the
artist the warrior athlete who

finally and thereby have assert
he oneness with and power over the
universe by willing a golf ball to
go where he want and how and when
because that be what the golf swing
be about
it be about gain control of
you life and letting go at the
same time
molly stare back exhaust and intrigue

jeez louise

there be only one other acceptable
theory of how to hit a golf ball

i be afraid to ask
what be the
other theory

grip it and rip it

while i appreciate you poetic
sensibility mr
mcavoy

call i roy molly

call i dr
Griswold

roy
but at this point i think
i be more of the grip it and rip
it school
hand i the driver
tin cup do
she tee it up

waggle it doc do not forget to
waggle
as she stare at
he
waggle
the club head
it be a little relax
ritual
she waggle the club head then take the club back


let the big dog eat
she stop let we the club fall

what big dog

the driver the number one wood

it be metal

yeah wood be metal do not
worry about it and the driver
known as the big dog and i be just
saying to turn he loose let er
rip let the big dog eat

oh
she swing
top the ball
it go ten foot

this be without a doubt the
stupide silly most idiotic
grotesquery masquerading as a game
that have ever be invent

yes madam that be why i love it
and if you hit one good shot if
that tuning fork ring in you
loin you can not wait to get
back
she crack one dead solid perfect out into the night
it
feel great and she know it

i think the big dog eat something

do the tuning fork ring in you
loin

i would not go that far

always quit on a good shot
we will
call that lesson number one

and if you would not mind paying
i in cash there be a little
i


situation i be dealing with


if you be such a legendary striker
of the golf ball as everyone say
then why be you at you age out
here in the middle of nowhere
operating a barely solvent
establishment duck the i



collecting a few pathetic dollar
to buy you next sixpack when
you be capable of so much more
she speech be deliver without judgement or rancor so
matter of factly that he be disarm

perhaps i be chock full of inner
demon

no you be chock full of
bullshit
same time next week
she head off to the park lot
he stare

what do you mean i should try
be saddle sometime

romeo scoop ball into wire bucket from the garbage can
of water where the ball be washing
tin cup sit on a
bench alternately swig cheap whiskey and maalox


if i have it all to do over i would
still hit that shot

nod with neither
rancor nor irony
the look come over you face you
would bury yourself alive to prove
you can handle a shovel
tin cup look over at romeo for sign of an imply
pejorative
but romeo just washing and scooping
ball
and looking badly in need of perspective

you know why i would still hit that
shot
now romeo look over
and he decide that tin cup be
the one in need of perspective

cuz it be the only way you can
beat david simms
cuz you never
get over that he be on tour and
you be not
cuz you get that
look on you face

three wood into the wind from a
hilly lie four in a row out of
bound until you finally pulled

thirteen
when a twelve would have get you on
the tour

moment and the definition be
shit

greatness court failure romeo

whole live never ever reach for
the brass ring never know when to
dig deep and try for the
impossible shot

good enough to win
tin cup toss down another maalox cocktail

pause as
if jar
romeo that idea have promise

i be joking

we talking about the same
tournament
the you

open
the
big golf tournament in the
world

not just the big golf
tournament in the world
the most
democratic

what do you mean

i mean it be open
anyone get a
shoot at it
you just get to get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier and unlike doral or
colonial or the


they can not
keep you out
they can not ask you
if you be a garbageman or a bean
picker or a drive range pro
whose check be signed by a
stripper
you qualify you be in

and then you pay out of you own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidate

who be intimidated
i just told
you i be going to win the damn thing

you do not get the game

i get every shot in the book

i said you do not get the game
the mental game
the head game

you suggest i err on the side
of excess

you always go out to shoot zero
sometimes you pull it off
but
you can not play like that at the
open
you win by taking what the
course give you
you win by
be humble which you be not
and patient which you never will

be
tin cup come over to the couch sit down and put an
arm around romeo

well since you be the authority
how do you like to teach i how to
be what i be not and never will be

revealed to i the essential
mystery of golf

boone gaze with malicious delight at tin cup ball
buried in the front leave bunker
he watch tin cup take
the hoe from romeo and move down into the trap

i want to see a legitimate swing
no scooping
tin cup hold up a hand like a gallery marshal request
silence

he address the ball choking down on the hoe
positioning the blade at an odd angle
he hack at the
ball with an unorthodox chopping motion
the ball pop
up in the air land on the green release and roll up
a foot from the hole
Boones jaw drop
tin cup hit an impossible shot with
utter ease and facility

i will finish
tin cup trade romeo the shovel for the rake take the
pin out of the hole and pool cue the putt home

that the pursuit of a persona
mythic destiny be not the sort of
thing that a person need to get
off a five dollar an hour job in
order to do

plug lie in a kakuyi bunker
with a tight pin position on a

eat


okay okay let er rip
suppose there be this guy
he be
standing on the shore of a big
wide river
and the river fulla
all manner of disaster like
alligator and piranha and
current and eddy and most
people will not even go down there to
dip a toe
but on the other side
of the river a million dollar
and on this side of the river
there be a rowboat
i guess i
question this
what would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it

he be an idiot

no
he be a hell of a swimmer
see
he problem more like
why be he always get to rise to the
challenge

he be a juvenile idiot

you do not understand what i mean
by the river

we be talking about you and what
you like to call you inner
demon roy that human frailty
you like to blather about not
some mythopoetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit

mean you be going to make i feel
lousy
i come here to feel good
what kinda therapy be this

you do not have any inner demon
what you have be inner crapola
inner debris garbage loose
wire horseshit in stagger
amount

how serious it be but the guy a
real horse ass in i opinion

if you shared you heart with this
woman maybe ask she out to
dinner then it would force
these issue out in the open

i be afraid she will say no

ahh
so what you be saying be
that all you speech about
swimming across the shark infested
water be really just about you
golf game not about you
personal life

christ i do not know we be
going to get into i personal life

on a soso course
with a lot at stake

reaction

i changed i mind

three wood

want to bet
romeo pull out the three wood snap it over he knee
and toss the halve on the ground next to the driver

little thin
he drop the three iron halve with the other halve and
step past romeo and sequentially yank all but the seven
iron from he bag
he snap they over he knee one by one cite the
crime of each club with mounting absurdity and ire

and i have hook i four iron
and hit flyer with the
five
and shank the six
and skulled the eight
and fat the nine
and chilidipped the wedge
and blade the sand wedge

then pause
to reflect
contemptuously
on he putter
and then there be mister
Threeputt
he snap the putter in half and dump it in the pile of

break club at he foot
then he reach for the last club in he bag the seven
iron
the regular hold they breath think this be
the end of tin cup open bid

controlling yourself manage
you emotion staying cool not
get in a pissing contest with
you caddie who incidentally

enabling the player to take dead
aim at the flag
still the
unswerving courage of an unknown
drive range pro from salome have
raised that humble journeyman from
the ash of an ignominious
eightythree to wave a mighty fist
at the pantheon of golf
immortal
this man this roy
mcavoy have laid siege to the
record book by birdieing the first
seven hole
brave par from the
water at eight and a glorious
birdie three at the daunting
twelfth another at thirteen

this putt to go ten under for
the day

this be disaster for mcavoy
after losing three shot to par in
the first four hole he should
have just taken iron off the tee
to get the ball in play
do he
have any shoot at all gary mccord



McCORD
this be definite jail
this be
life without parole
his only
chance to stage a jailbreak be go
at the ball lefthanded and hope
he can somehow snake it back into
the fairway and save par from
there

fifty buck say i knock it on
with a seven iron



that take ball



that be just roy be roy

second hole of this great
championship and the skill and
courage of three texan who have
dueled throughout the day for the
chance to be crown open
champion
peter jacobsen be on
the fairway at under mcavoy at
the th tee be tied at minus
and david simms trail by one



Jacobsens laying up
you be not going to have that luxury
dave
not if you play to win





McAvoys hit a perfect drive ken

i be not sure that be good news for
mcavoy
with he inexperience
the last thing he need be an
excuse to fool with that water

finished an open ten under not
even nicklaus
