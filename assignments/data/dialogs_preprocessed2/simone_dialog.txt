forceful shake of the
head
accord to the writ she attorney

in a single frame

so we will recast

offend she

we do not need a name
we will cast
an unknown

i will not play opposite an unknown

we can not sell an unknown
nicolas
sour on the project and we have
to accept that
if we ever want to
be in the nicola anders business

blackmail bitch

a wince address
everyone but viktor

we told they what to wear what to
say who to date
when they be

film by

lady and gentleman of the jury i

be committed with the pure of
intention to send a message to
the act community who put
themselves above the work and
above

continuing they
conversation from the
lobby

Taransky

dazzle new ingenue have come
from seemingly nowhere to capture
the heart of moviegoing audience
across the nation

dawning of new star in




in she debut film sunrise
sunset
website dedicated to



she face be already post on
everything from websites to bedroom
wall
simone cape and hood despite the swelter heat



she wardrobe have inspired a fashion
craze
a pirate recording of on a
camcorder



and bootleg copy of she film be
be sell in back alley all over
the world
showing a clip of from courtesy
Taransky production

but who be simone
we know so
little about she
no detail of
she background have be released
not even she age
she be somewhere
between a girl and a woman

fresh face and familiar both at the
same time
multiplex
the marquee have screen and look like
this










be simone even she real name
and
why the secrecy
all we know for
sure be that she be discover by
littleknown director viktor
Tarinsky

Taransky

he have parlayed he relationship
with the new sensation into a three
picture deal with the very studio
that dump he only six month
ago
and no wonder with the
starlet performance breaking all
box office record

simone

i
i
want to you

simone
simone

where be she

good to see you too elaine

why be not she with you

why
because she would never show
up at something like this
she be
intensely private

dismiss she
colleague
back to work everyone
she be not
here

viktor
i want to thank you for
convince simone to sign with the
studio

Simones decision

Simones check

anyway it
mean a lot
have you read the review
they be
love letter
listen to this one
simone have
the voice of a young jane fonda
the body of sophia loren the grace
of well grace kelley and the
face of audrey hepburn combined
with an angel

almost right

i can not wait to meet she

i do not know if that be going to
happen

why not

as i say she be
something of a
recluse
that be how she be able to
stay so pure by isolating
herself in she art

do not be ridiculous
i arranged a
press conference

out of the question
circus like
that

viktor it be i studio

she be i actor
there be other
studio elaine
there be only one

i be a twotime academy award
nominate director with over
eighteen film to i credit thus
far including i late release
sunrise sunset
who be you

i will not be taking any question
however i do have a statement to
read on behalf of i lead lady
simone
reading from his
statement
to whom it may concern
i be
deeply grateful for the
extraordinary public response to
mr
Taranskys film
at this time
i will be conducting no interview
or making publicity appearance
since i be really nothing without
the beautiful world and character
mr
Taransky create for i
i
politely request that the press
respect i privacy and let the work
speak for itself
all question
and inquiry should be directed to
mr
Taransky to whom i entrust all
aspect of i career
yours very
truly simone

viktor viktor who be simone
date

viktor where do you find she

be simone she real name

what be she get to hide

be she the new garbo

who be garbo

i think i make it clear no
question regarding simone
bringing the press
conference to a hasty
conclusion
now i would like to close by
announce that miss simone begin
production today on she next film
eternity forever
this project
have be near and dear to i heart
since i write it nine year ago
a tinge of bitterness
then a smile
i thank you



who do you think you be fooling
Taransky

do i know you

max sayer national echo

regain he composure
a smirk
do not you have a real story to
write
why be not you in latin
america

this be the story

i remember when the echo have class
the paper that could bring down
government

we leader be not president
anymore they be pop star and
screen idol
if woodward and
bernstein be alive today they would
be right here in hollywood with i

they be alive sayer

so they be probably here
you might be able to sell this
disappearing acta to the rest of
the world but i be not buying it
what be really behind this simone
woman
the public have a right to
know
why be she staying out of
sight
and why the hell be she
with you
i do not want you to take
this the wrong way viktor but
you be not exactly cecil
DeMille more runofthemill

maybe the reason she be with i be a
little thing called integrity
sayer
look it up

oh i know all about integrity
i
know even more about persistence
look that one up

no one come in or go out just
like you said mr
Taransky

good

be miss simone coming today

she be already here
she arrive
before you and she will leave long
after you have go
remember under no circumstance
be you or any other person to
enter the set without i express
permission

what if it catch on fire

let it burn
simone would rather
go up in flame than give up she
privacy

to himself as he insert
he hollywood harddrive

pay no attention to the man behind
the computer
welcome
to

welcome
to


good morning simone

good morning mr
Taransky

star be

digitize

you mean they buy it

nervous smile as he
examine he first
royalty check
buy it
they be paying for it
and around here that be how you
really know they buy it

i be only sorry hank be not here to
see this

depressing the button
every time he want to
express he thought
through simone
maybe he can

do you have any idea what this
mean simone
we ability to
manufacture fraud now exceed we
ability to detect it

appear to indulge
viktor with a smile
i be the death of real

ponder the enormity of
the hoax
you be birth of
what

phenomenon
miracle
new era
in show business
all i wanted to
do be finish the film

and now look what you have start
and now look what you have start
and now look what you have start

hmm
a little less streep a
little more bacall

be that good mr
Taransky

yes
yes it be

while i think of it i would like you
to add something to you repertoire
remember that thing hepburn do
in breakfast at Tiffanys

from the screen an
incomparable smile
hi

let we hear you say hi like
audrey

imitate Audreys
performance perfectly
hi

perfect
god i be so relax around you

you do create i

no
i
just helped bring someone
else dream to life

mr
Taransky we both know i be
nothing without you
i be
computer code one and zero

you be right
you be right
of
course one do not want to boast
it be a classic case of technology
in search of an artist
that be all
you have be waiting for an artist
with integrity with a vision who
can see

see beyond that irrational
allegiance to flesh and blood

see that with the rise in price of
a real actor and the fall in price
of a fake the scale have tip
in favor of the fake
voice raising in
excitement
see that if the performance be
genuine it do not matter if the
actor be real
once a performance
be committed to film the blood and
bone be go anyway
only the
spirit the illusion remains
besides what be real anymore
these day most actor have digital
work do to they so it be a gray
area

simone appear to look
directly at she maker
be you ever going to tell the
truth about i mr
Taransky

the only real truth be in the work

you know what i be talking about

yes
yes i be going to tell the
truth about you why would not i
ponder he own
question
of course with hanks tragic
passing the secret die with he
shaking the thought from
he head
i be going to tell the truth
after you next picture

speaking of which this be the
project i would like you to do next

not eternity forever
the
legendary unproduced script that
be too good ever to get make
i would
kill for that part

i be hope you would say that

i will do anything to please you mr
Taransky

pretend to be hard of
hear
i be sorry i do not catch that
what do you say

i will do anything to please you mr
Taransky

and i will never ever leave you

you be so beautiful

that i know it be going to be a
great project if we all just trust
mr
Taranskys vision

mr
Taransky

no one go in there

oh i know

if it be not too much trouble
could you

of course

hesitant about broach
the subject
this last year i be
going
through some thing
shaking she head at the
memory
awful awful
thing
but when i
see simone in sunrise
what she
do
in the scene in the
firework factory
suddenly everything make sense
i friend family doctor
nobody could reach i but
simone she really
speak to i

she will be happy to sign it



cut
cut
cut

hal what be you do

viktor clyde simply have to get
close to simone in this scene
he
have to touch she
he have to

absolutely not

but she be right there
i must feel
she

you can not

why not

struggling to find an
excuse
there be
a wall between you

an emotional wall i know
that be why

no
no
real wall
describe a wall with
he hand within the
green space
you run right through it

how do the wall get there

i can not explain it to you now
you will see when it be all put
together
anyway we get it a couple of take
ago
let we move on

what you do not understand
clyde be that love be like a wild
flower but that flower only
grow

elate melancholy anxious
jubilant tearful frighten
giddy weep petrified
ecstatic blubbering loss of bladder
inebriated kevorkian control

reflective chaste seductive
thoughtful virtuous lustful
meditative angelic bestial
stoic madonna madonna
bored out of she
skull

let we take it down a notch

what you do not understand

i like it
but still too big
small teardrop next time

it be not work
it be not alive
let we try it again

teardrop arriving on
cue
what you do not understand
clyde be that love be like a wild
flower but that flower only grow
on the edge
of a very high cliff

perfect simone

i be only sorry you still have to
work with flesh and blood for the
time be as user friendly as
you be even i can not manufacture
an entire cast

we be going to have to change we
plan simone you have no idea
what an affect you performance be
have on people
we can not stop
now
there be too much to say
these film they speak they speak
to the human condition
we be
changing live
no revealing the
truth now would be too cruel
searching for more
justification
anyway when you be seeking a
great truth in the work you
be not so concern with the
lesser truth along the way

you be going to get in a lot of
trouble mr
Taransky

irritated at she prick
he conscience
why do you have to bring that up
there be always risk life a
risk
it be worth it
besides how
could something so lovely be a
crime

the hollywood
foreign press be going to eat this
up

thank you
what do you think Lainey

one thing bothered i

i know hal be as stiff as always

no not that
i be just wonder
in the bedroom scene in reel two
why do simone have no reflection
when she walk in front of that
mirror

i wonder if you would spot that
you have get a good eye Lainey
i be
proud of you

i get they to remove the
reflection
the mirror metaphor
to show how she character
inwardly dead

that be genius viktor
be that
Simones idea

sarcastic annoy at the
suggestion
who else
it be always Simones
idea

so that account for the lack of a
shadow in reel six

precisely

goodnight daddy

night Lainey

elaine i do not know if it be a good
idea for Lainey to come to the
screening mature content and
all that

impress by his
responsible attitude
maybe you be right
twelve year after you daughter
born you decide to become a father

well late than never

i should fire you more often
the
film looking wonderful

you really think so

yes
to be honest i never quite
see this film before maybe it be
the way simone be playing it but
what it be saying about the illusion
of permanence in everyday life how
that be the only way we can love
i think it be really going to mean
something

thank you

i know what you mean

anxiously looking to the
restroom
i have to talk to she about i
experimental film
it be very
experimental

be that she
by the fountain

no
in fact between we she
do not really exist

ignore he calling out
to the woman

Simones here

slightly the bad for

simone

forget eternity forever the
big news tonight be the surprise
appearance of simone
even these
seenitall superstar be
apparently not immune to simone
fever and the result stampede
force organizer to bring the
event to an early end
i speak
with some of the depart guest
about they encounter with
Hollywoods most reluctant
superstar

i would say even more beautiful
in person you have to see she to
believe she

i can not reveal what we speak
about
it be
personal
simone
and i go back a long way

when she talk to you for that
moment you be the only other
human being in the room

i really do not know what the
fuss be about
so overrated
she be do one film
talk to i
when she be have the kind of career
i have have

i do expect she to be nominate
yes

fortunately simone be not amongst
the injure and be spirit away
as mysteriously as she arrive

she go to a major hollywood
Alist party and we do not get an
interview a comment we do not even
get a photograph
be that what
you be telling i

nobody get a photograph
nobody
ever get a photograph

we have get we good people on it
mr
sayer

hour tail on Taransky

shutter bug camp outside any
place he go every concierge and
maitre d on the take
but this
simone woman be good

refer to a
confidential
report
obviously the name be not real
she be use an assume identity
travel under a false name check
into hotel with an alias
she
never stay in the same place two
night in a row
anything on the
satellite photo
what about the fingerprint
what
happen when we dust that hotel
suite

well we get some of Taranskys
fingerprint a lot of you
fingerprint
but none of hers

which mean they be significant
incriminating
perhaps criminal
she be hide she past
she be
hide she past

of course no one that perfect
that pure
you know i have
something on mother teresa
but
then she die and it be not worth
it anymore
i know how to flush out this simone
a tellall story from she
childhood

i god you have get one

offering milton a seat in
front of the computer
i will when you be finished writing
it

disappoint in his
protege
be i wasting i time with you
when she sue to protect she
privacy she will have to appear in a
public courtroom to do it

long live the first amendment

sometimes you have to tell a small
lie to get to the big truth
to he nervous
photographer
as for a photo if you can not do
it i know twelve million people
who can

you can not go in there

we have to talk to she viktor

we know she be in there

struggling to hold they
back
why
what be all this about

we have get the tracking number
for eternity forever

they be in the toilet

she have to get out there and
sell the film

what do you want she to do go
doortodoor

even garbo would be on the talk
show circuit if she be alive
today

it be precisely because she
do not crave the limelight that
people love she
i told you she be
only about the work

this be overshadow the work

waving the front page of
the echo
that be the problem
she be more
famous for she noshows than she
show

it be starting to look like she
do not support the film or you
viktor
trying to squeeze past
viktor
if you can not handle she i will

not now
she be emotional
she
mother die today
scene fortytwo
of good for nothing
it be not a
good time

no
please do not go in there

where be she

she be not here

elaine
i

so the secrete finally out
viktor

i can explain

i do not think that be necessary
i think it be perfectly clear
i
should have guess it all make
sense now
it be why she never
go anywhere never see in
public

she be into computer

probably spend she whole life in
chat room

it be the one place she can be
herself

anonymous

it be bad than you think
she be
extremely agoraphobic have a
morbid fear of people and germ
in a way i be relieve you
find
out

the premiere be the first time
i have convinced she to venture out
and it just confirmed she bad
nightmare

viktor you should have say
something

she do not want pity

seeing a new side of
viktor
you be so good to protect she like
this

to the executive
concede
i will tell you what
i know how

the riot and everything
picking up a frame photo
from the work station

irritated at be

buck yet

never avert he eye
from the screen
cashier check go out to we
anonymous tipster this morning

who say
there be no place for checkbook
journalism
we will be running
still of this for month then
release the whole tape we will get
we money back maybe show it on
an exclusive payperview event
do you realize what we have here
we have the only independent
footage of simone in existence

we used to

holding a copy of the


time calendar
section simone live
she be do frank brand on
thursday

get out

tonight on frank brand live

since taking the nation by storm
with she debut movie sunrise
sunset

no one manage to land a live
interview with the fabulous new
shoot starlet simone
until
now

make up you mind viktor
make up
you mind

i be happy to say she be agreed to
join we tonight from the set of she
new film
turning to the
monitor
welcome simone

wonderful to be with you frank

she be all woman

well no one could accuse you of
be overexposed simone
why
have you stay so completely out
of the limelight

i just think actor talk too much
do the world really want to hear
you life story just because you have
get a movie open friday

of course the only problem with
shy away from publicity these
day be that it tend to attract
more

do not i know it
that be the only
reason i be here now to put the
attention back where it belong on
mr
Taranskys film

you do not secretly want the
attention

i be not even sure i deserve it
after tonight i will have almost as
much screen time on you show as i
do in i movie
how be that
healthy for a performer

because you have to understand
frank these interview none of
this be real
who i be on screen
and who i really be be two totally
different people

who be you really

that be a good question
as nietzsche said whenever a man
strive long and hard to appear
someone else


reading from a bookmarked
page along with simone

he end up finding it be
difficult to be himself again


well put

focus on the desert
background behind simone
i know where that be
i know

change of topic
simone you have
be romantically linked to dozens
of man in the press mick jagger
stephen hawking fidel castro
and most recently viktor Taransky
be there a mr
right in there
somewhere

i would rather not discuss i private
life
but viktor and i be inseparable

you dog viktor

i literally would not be here today
without he

would you like a moment simone

no i be okay

let we talk about the work that you
care so much about

sure
where would you like to
start

how about the nudity

nudity have just never be an issue
for i frank
for i clothes be
just an option

what exactly be it that attract
you to you first two project

i suppose the thing i like most
about the movie i be in be that
they be not about special effect

they be good for it if i may say


well we appear to be experience
satellite difficulty
in case we
lose you simone i want to thank
you

thank


hel

hello

viktor be you with she
be
she there

no

be you and simone
get marry

taken aback by the
suggestion
no of course not
realize the
significance of the
question
why
would you care if we be

covering realize she
have given herself away
well yes
from a studio point of
view it would be good if simone
stay single
anyhow i think she come across
great tonight
intelligent well
informed a natural
and touching
she be spectacular

thank you

dimple

i have stabbed people
in the back claw and sleep i
way to where i be it go with
the territory but for some
reason i can not betray simone
there be
i do not know any other
way to say it there be a goodness
to she

no there be not
there be nothing
to she

because we be here alone like
this
but in the morning you would go
back to she
what man would not

she totally

but you do not understand
she will
always be there at some party
on some magazine cover some song
on the radio up on some screen

no
she will never work again
retire never make a movie or a
record or appear ever again

of course she will
she public
will demand it

not if i do not let she

you

i be going to tell you a secret now
elaine
simone be not a real person
i
invent she

misinterprete he
remark
every actor be an invention
viktor
do not embarrass yourself
no one deny that you
discovered simone
but it be like
finding a diamond in the desert
anyone can trip over it but it be
not the finder who sparkle

no no i do not trip over she
you do not understand

you just get lucky that she be
loyal enough to stay with you
maybe she be staying out of pity
who know
she certainly do not
need you
some people even say
you be holding she back

who say that
never mind
you have to listen
to i elaine
simone be thin air
pixel mold by i from a
mathematical equation
i inherit
it from a madman i can show
you

how much wine have you have

she be a figment of i own
imagination
i viktor Taransky
have perpetrate the great hoax
the great sleightofhand
sleightofmouth sleightof
sleight in entertainment history
and still no one appreciate i
recognize what i have do even
you

you be drunk than i think
be
you do that again

no
whatever talent simone have
come from i i
i
i swear
as god be i judge
you do not know
what i have be through
tens of
thousands of mindnumbing hour in
front of that screen night
without end and look what it be
cost i
why do you think i have be wearing
these
i may have do irreparable
harm to i eyesight and why
to
extract and refine the infinite
nuance of a human be a human
soul
do not you see
i make simone

you make simone
viktor she make you

you bitch
i will destroy you
watch dig through he trash
max find a
beat up reel of mm film
hold the end up to the light he eye pop
show censor film frame of a naked simone in a
compromise position
hovering at a supermarket checkout line
overhear two discuss the article

disgusting

she must have be so desperate to
do something like that so
deprave

i be still name i baby after she

you be have a boy

so
viktor blanch
it be not the reaction he would hope for
we hear a farmyard scene in an empty
farmyard on all fours grunt like a pig and forage
for muddy vegetable
the be shocked then suddenly break into
spontaneous applause
viktor enraged exit into the lobby past the poster for
i starring simone
behind he

for simone to do something as brave
as i at this point in she
career with so much to lose all
i can say be i am pig i be
oscar
wrinkle to simone
on a screen
however she squeakyclean image have
go hair unkempt bloated chainsmoking and drink
during the interview
the be smile weakly

simone that be a rather
controversial position

i just think all elementary school
should have a fire range so
student can learn how to defend
themselves
we could fit it
inbetween recess and american
history

if there be a hole in the ozone
layer why can not i see it

immigration
god be not it
crowded enough

if it be
any consolation you be going to
live on in the public heart like
all the other tragic figure that
go before they time
there be no
love like posthumous love

i know what you be think
it be
a phoneybaloney world
the woman

athlete be on steroid the
singer be lipsyncing if they be
even singing at all the news be
entertainment the politician be
buy and paid for we be living
one big lie
so why should not you
live too
you be more authentic
than the people who adore you
and that be the problem
you be
looking at the real fraud
i told
myself this be all about the work
but if that be the truth it
would not matter to i and it
do
it be not that the artist
have no respect for the art
they
have no respect for i
someone
like you you have so much love
shower on you i just wanted to
feel one tiny drop on i face
i be
sorry simone
here i have be
trying to convince the world that
you exist but i be really trying
to convince they that i exist
it be not that you be not human

it be i sad and solemn duty to
announce the tragic pass of

step forward
muster the courage to
ask the question
how do she die

rare virus
pretend to compose
himself
on she goodwill tour of the third
world

do she suffer

mercifully it be quick
show around the globe

including the driveway
insensitively drive over
the bouquet to the horror of the including
and
around a television showing a live picture of Simones

procession lead solemnly by proceed through the
studio lot
distraught toss flower onto
the hearse
sitting on a stool in a river

stop washing they clothes to watch

the weekend

horrify by the
suggestion
how can you bring that up at a time
like this

i hear he say die bitch

he be a control madman she
be a prisoner
i blame myself
i should have do more to stop
it

it be strange
he wanted to
replace she with i in he new
movie
and i know i be not that
good

forgive i mr
Taransky
i be
just trying to understand
all
these film appearance

fake
refer to various
item
this be fake this be fake fake
fake fake all fake

that be right
you understand
perfectly
i will confess to
fraud not murder

refer to oversize
mail bag
fan club with a worldwide
membership in the millions also
bogus

oh no
the fan club be real
but
they be worship computer code
one and zero

so of course you could not kill
simone because there never be a
simone

of course

and this mr
hank Aleno who you
talk so much about a renowned
failure who also happen to be so
conveniently dead perhaps the
man you claim helped invent
simone be an invention himself

but not everyone imaginary be
they mr
Taransky
i refer of
course to edith

who

the woman you admit to a
journalist be Simones mother and
for whose silence you paid a
fortune
be she not flesh to you
be she tear not wet

i

she be insane
this whole thing be
insane
there be no simone
look
even she name be fake
it be not
simone
he tear Simones name in
half to demonstrate
it be

simulation one

regarding Simones face
also torn in half
you really hated she do not you

perhaps you could explain this to
i mr
Taransky or be this tape
doctore too

it be footage from the marina
closedcircuit camera on the night
in question
alter of course
be that really what you expect we
to believe mr
Taransky

can you tell we why you be
dispose of the body of a woman
who do not exist

it be not she body
it be she
body of work

why do not you just come clean
viktor

you will
feel well afterwards

i be telling the truth

we all know what happen
in a
fit of jealous rage you killed
simone and dump she body off a
boat she buy for you

no
i can prove it to you
i will
take you to she

panicky desperately
grab the diver
do you find anything else
driver disc
discdrives

nothing
we could not stay down any longer


plead guilty and throw yourself
on the mercy of the court
it be
the good deal you be going to get

i could get the death penalty

you certainly will if you go to
trial a jury in this kind of
ugly mood
you have killed an icon
for god sake

i do not kill anyone bernard
there be no one to kill

an insanity defence

let we go Lainey
there be nothing
here

just a minute

god it be so like you father
why
can not people take responsibility
for they action anymore
i can
almost forgive he for kill
simone but deny she
existence
i can never forgive
that

because obviously she exist
right

i know it as surely as you be
sitting here sweetheart
she be
the most vital woman i ever meet

so you do meet she

of course
what be you
suggest

i mean really meet she in the
flesh

i know it be embarrass to admit
it mom but when i think about it
honestly i have not
i mean it
feel like i have
i know more
about she than member of i own
family
she be even in i dream
but i realized going back through
i diary they be all
appearance near miss at
party secondhand rumor gossip
on the internet
i have never
actually see simone up close
touched she be in she physical
presence
have you

well i

we do not believe daddy because
we do not want to believe we be
taken in too

trying to shake the
notion from she head
Lainey there be no evidence that
simone be not real

listen to what you be saying mom
be there any evidence she be

there be one part of dado story
that may have be true
simone
may have contracted a virus

certain virus can be cured

hush tone refer
to a thick psychiatric
report
listen i have find a
psychiatrist in ventura well
respected who be will to
testify under oath that you have
diminished capacity due to the
trauma of you divorce ten year
of abject failure in the movie
business and a bump on the head you
sustained as a child

no
i can not go along with this
horseshit
just tell they they can
fry i

aghast looking around to
see if anyone have hear
what

it be premeditate i know
exactly what i be do
i
strangled she
i bludgeon she
i set she on fire
i do it
i
killed she



excuse i

i think you would well see this

break news international
media star simone be alive and
well
she studio released this
footage only minute ago

simone reading today edition
of the

time
who say the
only bad publicity be you
obituary
detail at the top of
the hour

you be indestructible

i will never get you hollywood
people

relaxing back into his
seat
thank you
i do not know how you do it but
thank you

putting she arm around
he
do not thank we too fast viktor
you know what we have to do

why stop at one character when you
can have a whole cast

exactly
now that you have the
studio behind you we can really do
thing

i be think what about you
and
simone moving back in with
i and Lainey

that sound wonderful
how do you feel about all this
Lainey

about you and mom

i and simone
what i do

you mistake be not making
something fake daddy
we be fine
with fake as long as you do not
lie about it

do not look so glum viktor
it be
not a death sentence

still stare out of the
window a rueful smile
no
it be life

simone the question on
everyone mind be simply
why


frank you know as well as i do
living in a fish bowl the
insatiable appetite of the media

with everything that be going on
in i life i just needed to drop
out of sight for a while i
needed time
viktor buy i that
time
i owe he so much

we all do
quickly returning to
simone
but now i understand you be eager
to get back to work and not the
kind of work that we be all
expect

that be true
i can reveal that i
be consider a career in
politics

and what may i ask bring this on

i suppose this little man have
something to do with it
viktor
and i be both concern about what
kind of world we new son chip be
going to grow up in
turning lovingly to
viktor
be not you viktor

turning lovingly to
simone
yes
