scotch and begin drink



the same be illuminated by the light of a single candle
he be dancing holding on tightly to a

though the light be dim it be clear that he be clean shaven
with he hair neatly trimmed
they connection be powerful and alive
they stop dancing
overwhelmed with mutual desire
he hold the woman face in he hand and it all
over moving into a realm of feel that be foreign to he

hyperventilate or faint


ah here she be now
lady mrs
franklin roosevelt

good afternoon
i be so please to
be invited here today
looking down at she
card
too often


too often
she stop
the pause be deadly
louis look ready to jump out
a window
eleanor continue she voice still pitched too high

too often the great decision be
originate and given form in body
make up wholly of man
slowly she begin to find she voice

so that whatever political value
woman have to offer be shunt
aside
without expression

his be a mistake
she look up from she card and stare at the audience
and for the first time speak spontaneously

i think this might be the reason i
be have such a difficult time
giving voice to i own thought
here today
the immediacy of she selfeffacing comment charm the room

i be remind of what someone once
said about looking at an elephant
that it be impossible to ever see
an entire elephant from one place
you must walk around it
if we
elected leader be to be truly
effective then they must be will
to go out of they way to look
beyond what be right in front of
they
to see the entire elephant
and for that
they need we help
the lady applaud she much to she relief
louis beam

chairwoman be drink tea

i be sorry you be franklin
roosevelt be not you

depend
be you a lawyer

then roosevelt it be
wait
he jump one of roys checker

i be helena mahoney
i be a physical
therapist
you have no idea who i be do you

should i

i write you a letter right after i
see the article in the paper
do not you read it

it get read i assure you
but
probably not by i
helena glance down at the checkerboard and point to it

he be open right there


he sure be

thank you madam

i have be study the effect of
moist heat on polio patient and i
think with repeat exercise in
warm water

it can help they regain lost
strength

yes

incredibly i have come to the same
conclusion myself

well you be the doctor


no ramp no run water no
doctor
from the article in the
newspaper i assumed this be a
rehabilitation center


do not believe everything you read

i feel like i be bring here
under false pretenses

join the club




push against i hand

give i the good news first

you gluteus maximus be good than
i hope
it will serve you well

must be all that sit

i be serious
you right leg have
some movement along the thigh
that be good because we can use it
to help extend you hip flex you
knee and rotate you tibia

i be suppose to walk on one side

the water may help build some
strength i be not able to see yet
but to do that you would need to
swim in the water much of the day
not the limit hour you have now
a beat
why should this place cater to a
few ablebodied folk when it could
be open year round with polios


there be a need for a place like
this tom

be you aware
that in the last
epidemic over people get
polio in the new york area alone

sound like you have be reading up

i wish there be more to read
damn
few thing be written about any
of this
to think of someone like
fred
locked away
he mind and
heart so vibrant

it be a waste
an awful waste
franklin take a beat the weight of this sink in

what be the acreage here

roughly twelve hundred or so
why

i want to buy it
i think it would
make one hell of an investment

investment

twelve hundred acre
enough for
two resort do not you think

it would take money
there be a lot
of land rebuilding the inn add
ramp and so many people can not pay

do you think old peabody will sell

he will sell

how can you be so sure

have you taken a look at this
place

that this will be the first polio
rehabilitation and treatment center
in the world
i personal trust
almost cover the price of the inn
and the surround land
there
will be a modest tuition charged to
the patient which should hold we
over while i seek out investor

you have

and there be other cost to
consider

perspire forehead with the back of he hand

at he hand and see that it be shaking



franklin be walking on crutch aid by roy
nearby a group
of child practice on parallel bar with helena

lionel offer up the envelope but then pull it back before
hand it over

save i the stamp
franklin nod then grab it from lionel
he rip it open and
begin devouring the report


therefore in conclusion i
research have show that the
overwhelming majority of patient
here have show some improvement
enough for i to recommend warm
water therapy as the standard post
polio treatment to the Orthopedics
society of america

the muscle mass on either side of
the spine in the low lumbar
region
he low extremity

continue

i feel after study he that the
psychological factor in his
management be paramount
he have
such courage and ambition
yet at
the same time he be such an
extraordinarily sensitive emotional
mechanism
it be difficult for she to continue

please

that it will take all the skill
which we can muster to lead he
successfully to a recognition of
he severe physical limitation
without crushing he


patronizing sonofabitch
i
wanted to walk again

and you still might
this report
legitimize we have work so hard
