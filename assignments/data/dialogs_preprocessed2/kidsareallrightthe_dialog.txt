responsiveness be mostly internal
sometimes it be exciting for we to
see sexual responsiveness more you

externalize
laser look at they still baffled

like with a penis

of those movie they have hired two
straight woman to pretend and the
inauthenticity be just unbeara

so sometimes you be together so
long you just stop seeing the
other person
you just see weird
projection of you own junk

instead of talking to each other
you go off the rail and act
grubby and make stupid choice
which be what i do

sick about it because i love you
guy and i love you mom and that be
the truth
sometimes you hurt the
one you love the most

nic look down overwhelmed by it all

anyway i just wanted to say how
sorry i be about what i do and
