i be still a man under the skin
rog
you know i
i be a downtoearth
kinda guy right


well at least you still talk the
same

so who change


but you give up you private practice
suddenly you be into pure research
and you
you be what a
parasitologist

that be i father idea
private
practice
he wanted to set i up
i could not say no
but he be dead
now
and i i be still a snoop i

look at that
beautiful stuff
lookit it

with great enthusiasm
indicate the entire
lab

the note include a warn against
swallow the tongue whole but we
do not see the rest of this caution
satyr tongue be Hobbess code

trying to do be to find an
alternative to organ transplant

i know

shaking he head in
protest
do i say anything

excite waving
specimen of parasite
and diseased organ
around
look
you get man you get parasite
that live in on and around man
now
why not breed a parasite that
do something useful
eh
why not
breed a parasite capable of taking
over the function of any one of a
bunch of human organ
why not for
example a parasite living in the
human abdominal cavity that plug
into the circulatory system and
filter the blood like a kidney
if
it take a little blood for itself
so what
be generous
you can afford
it

you put the bug into the body of a
man with a diseased kidney the bug
attack the bad kidney dissolve
it it be assimilated by the body
and now you get a perfectly good
parasite where you used to have a
rotten kidney
i know what you be
going to say

rollo
Howsa boy
i be just think
about you


be glance at some of you
publication on you work with hobbes

yeah well i be flattered but you
will not find any real meat in they




no
how come

listen rog
i know hobbes be funny
you know
i told you that
but i
do not really know just how funny he
be
see
when he kick off they
send all the personal secret stuff
they find to he mother she be
still alive but just barely and
she send everything she think be
medical to i here at the lab
i be
Hobbess partner right
anyway i have be going through his
paper and what they add up to be
this
hobbes be shafting we all
i the university the foundation
and the council the private lab
everybody
we never really know what
it be we be working on
hobbes
give we each a few crumb but he
be the only one who know what the
whole loaf would look like


i bite
what do it look like

it look like and i quote a
disease to save man from he mind





i do not get it

lemme clarify for you

hobbes think that man be an animal
that think too much an animal that
have lost touch with he instinct
he primal self
in other word
too much brain and not enough guts
and what he come up with to help we
guts along be a human parasite that
be
lemme find it here
a
combination of aphrodisiac and
venereal disease a modern version
of the satyr tongue


but the important thing for you be
this
hobbes used annabelle as a
guinea pig
he implant she with
the thing
i figure that once the
parasite take annabelle go
berserk
i dunno what she do but
hobbes be not ready for it
he have
to kill she
and he be not trying to
burn she he be burning they all
of they


he do not make it



huh


maybe hobbes do not know it but
annabelle be a pretty popular girl
around Starliner towers
i have get
three man here maybe four who
host large freemoving apparently
pathogenic abdominal growth that
nobody i have tried can identify
you
be next on i list

i would kinda like to come over there
and have a look at one of these guy




i have get a date with one of they at
ten
can you make it

yeah
ah i do not want to panic you or
anything but i mean the way hobbes
design they they be suppose to
get out of hand real quick so you
do not have much time to think about
what be happening to you
once they
decide to start pumping all those
dynamite juice into the old blood
stream
i dunno
but if you see
some people do kind of compulsive
maybe even bizarre sexual thing




laughing
he do not
take this aspect too
seriously
yeah
what do i do then

i dunno
try tranquilizer
once you
can get at they there be a lotta
stuff you can use
i will bring a
bagful
it be just the standard
tropical kit
but the trick be to
get at they



it be apartment south tower
Starliner tower
may as well go
there directly



rog

i find myself making love to sigmund
freud
but i be have trouble because
he be old and die and he smell
bad and i find he repulsive
and
then he tell i that everything be
erotic everything be sexual you
know what i mean
he have a very thick
accent but i can understand he
perfectly
he tell i that even old
flesh be erotic flesh that disease
be the love of two alien kind of
creature for each other that die
be an act of eroticism that even
chemical combine out of sexual frenzy
and long
that breathe be sexual
that talk be sexual that just to
physically exist be sexual
and i
believe he and we make love
beautifully
