congratulations you be everything we have
come to expect from year of government
train
now if you will just follow i we
have one more test to administer an eye
exam

you
hey what be going on

back in the midfifties the government
start a little underfunded agency with
the simple and laughable purpose of making
contact with a race not of this planet

now if you will look directly at the end of
this device

everybody think the agency be a joke
except the alien
they make contact on
march nd outside new york city

there be nine of we that night
seven
agent
an amateur astronomer
and one poor
kid who get lost on the wrong back road

you bring the alien flower

they be intergalactic refugee with a
simple request
let we use the earth as an
apolitical zone for people without a
planet
ever see casablanca
same thing
no nazi
we agreed
so we mask all
evidence of they land

the worlds fair be a coverup

why else would we hold it in queens
now left
more nonhumans arrive every year
they live among we in secret

i see
not to change the subject but when
be you last catscan

every six month
it be company policy

well thank for the very amuse morning
but i be hopin you will show i where i come
in
because this be where i go out

yeah sure hang on i want to grab a coffee
while we be right here

do not tell i we have only get that powder
shit for cream again

oh

for future reference this be a good look
for you


any give time around fifteen hundred
land alien be on the planet the
majority right here in manhattan
most
alien be decent enough just trying to
make a live

not as many as you would think
human for the
most part do not have a clue
do not want
one either
they be happy
they think
they have get a pretty good bead on thing

why the big secret
people be smart they
can handle it

person be smart
people be dumb
everything they have ever known have be
proven to be wrong
thousand year ago
everybody know as a fact that the earth
be the center of the universe
five
hundred year ago they know it be flat
fifteen minute ago you know we human
be alone on it
imagine what you will know
tomorrow

what you will gain in perspective you will
lose in way you be too young to comprehend
you give up everything
sever every human
contact
no one will know you exist
ever
