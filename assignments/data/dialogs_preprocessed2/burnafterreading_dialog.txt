small yacht
osbourne stand at the wheel a light wind in
he face as the boat sail under motor power
after a beat he move to the front of the boat
an old man sit on a bench on the prow facing out into the
wind
he have snowy hair and a stern yankee face
he wear a
tweed cap
he do not much react to Osbournes approach

it be
the cold war end
now it seem like it be all bureaucracy
and no mission
