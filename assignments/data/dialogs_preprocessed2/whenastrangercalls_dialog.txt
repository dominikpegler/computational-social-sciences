i know they have not assign anyone
to it specifically
it be an old case

an old case
can you find he

yes
maybe not tomorrow maybe not
this week but i will find he

he could be anywhere by now

i do not think so
because he be a
foreigner
he will come back to the
city
after six year in confinement
it be the only place that be familiar
to he
that be important

man murder two child in cold
blood
jury declare he insane
how could such a person not be

he be send to a state mental
institution where the security be
less than perfect
and he escape
it
it be not fair

thing like that should never be
allow to happen again

i could not agree with you more

go ahead then
i accountant will
contact you

thank you
how be mrs
Mandrakis

of course




curt duncan be not going to run right
out and kill more child
i be not
worry about that



we have he for six year
under
continuous therapy some of it rather
forceful



and drug
tranquilizer
depressant lithium


eventually anyone will respond to
the treatment here

you give he electric shock


yeah we zap he a few time
it be fairly standard

it say here thirtyeight
thirty
eight time

what will happen to he now without
the drug he be on


Therell be some deterioration
that be
inevitable but we can not say how
much

during the time that you have he
here do you discover any particular
habit of he peculiarity quirk
anything that might help i find
he


it be all in the folder

any letter from people back in
england
family


that too be in the folder

let we get something straight here
doctor
i have be year in the
business of tracking people down and
putting they away
i spent almost a
year on curt duncan alone with the
trial the testimony the background
investigation
i do not come here
today to look in you goddamn folder
in fact i would not have come here
at all if you would do you job right


mr
clifford this be a hospital
not a penitentiary
everything that
pertain to one of we patient be
meticulously recorded in that
patient folder
whether you can
make sense of it or not


curt duncan be a classic paranoid
schizophrenic
they see themselves
as victim and they always blame
other people for the way they be
when duncan killed the Mandrakis
kid it be not an act of hostility
against the child but against
they parent
he be get back
at he own parent for trauma he
suffer in early childhood
the
criminal side of curt duncan be one
of terrible symbolic vengeance

assume he be not find right away
what will happen to he


i think you will find he
somebody
will find he
he can not function out
there
he will make a mistake
turning to face
clifford
this be where he belong
after six
year in here he be suddenly go
out to confront the world again
i
think he be in for a bit of a shock


Rackin they up today bill

do all right

mon in and shut the door

what will it be
hey
what will it be



what kind of clothes be he wearing
when he escaped



ordinary street clothes
not all of
we patient have to wear the green
gucci gown

do he have any money with he


probably
but not more than say
fifty dollar
some of the patient
be given little job around the
ward for which they be paid
it be
part of the rehabilitation



what be guy du mar




pronounce it
correctly
guy du Marraux syndrom


it be a psychomotor dysfunction

duncan have it


only from time to time which be
unusual

what be it


it attack the nervous system
people
suffering from it be irresistibly
compel to utter obscenity
sometimes one sometimes a whole
string of they
they can not control
it

be you be serious


yeah
here i will give you an example


duncan never have the twitch that
sometimes go with it
and with
duncan as i said the disease would
only manifest itself in period of
extreme anxiety
when he be really
flipping out in other word

duncan be catholic


yeah
so be i

that make three of we


be that right
so we all share the
same guilt


here
this be curt duncan shortly
after he be admitted here in




to put the situation right
the
hypodermic needle be only used to
give you medication that will calm
you down
they make you feel good
relax
all right
we be not putting anything in you
food either
the food be just food



no
i do not eat the food
it do not
taste right
