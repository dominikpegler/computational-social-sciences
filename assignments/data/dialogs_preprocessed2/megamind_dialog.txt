if you just up and quit
you
busted you ass for that desk

i will take it

what




it be be nearly six week and
still no word on the whereabouts of
billionaire playboy and
philanthropist wayne scott
tune
in at
as we look into what
have become metro Citys big
mystery



we now return to the hero of we
heart
the Uberman story


just robbed the diamond exchange

great great
put it on the pile

anything else today

no

sir the new reactor be install

do you want to throw the switch
i
know how you love to start
reactor


maybe later

what be it plato

sir i can not help but notice that
you have be
a little down lately

when i want you opinion i will beat
it out of you

yes sir i know but please
forgive i impertinence
it be just
that you seem to have lost you
lust for we profession
you have
stopped going on job and spend
most of you time watch Uberman
special

i have defeated i great enemy
i have free reign over metro city
i have more wealth than a thousand
sultan
i have achieve all i have
work for
so why be i so
unhappy

i mean i father god rest his
evil and tormented soul raised i
straight from the test tube to be a
symbol of evil


and i have accomplished something
he have only dream about the
destruction of metro Citys
champion
i tell you i have always
live with this unquenchable
thirst
i think it be to make
he proud or to get absolute power
but now that i have pretty much
accomplished both i be at a loss

i sort of have a theory about
all that

oh really

well for one thing maybe Uberman
be more important to you than you
thought

he be a worthy rival
sometimes i
wonder do he consider i he evil
equal or be i just an annoy
little gnat to he

what be the
second part

i think you sort of have a thing
for roxanne Ritchi






sir you plan always involve ms
Ritchi either be kidnap or
place in danger
if that be not
love i do not know what be
it be
the grow up equivalent of dip
she pigtail in the ink well
do not
you see
she be the one treasure
that be always escaped you

soon

problem

you broke up with Uberman

you must have high
standard
i mean you be dating
a god
i mean what be it take

maybe someone who be a little more
aware of he fault
someone a
little more sensitive

but attainable with cute little
cheek like a hamster and
heartbreak in he eye

i do have a boyfriend until
fairly recently

i be sorry this be so surreal

yeah they charge way too much at
these place now back to you
boyfriend
i be interest and
compassionate
i want to know about
you


thing be complicate
he be a
man married to he work
there
be
there be a lot of
competition in he line of
business
i be sure you know what
that be like

sure
in i business one thing i
have be
for example mine
be
uh
lou Ferr
igno

the bodybuilder who used to
play the hulk on

do he
well we be always up for
the same role
do you boyfriend
have someone like that

particular rival that be always
get he goat so to speak

well
one rival in particular
seem to get more of he attention
than i ever do
but enough about
i problem



i be sorry
i get a whoop cough

i

see there it go
again

it be conflict he thrive on
he
always said he would not know what
to do with himself if master i
mean this guy be go
it be
like he needed it like oxygen

i think i finally understand
the
only logical answer be to recreate
that rivalry or if that be
impossible create one of equal
structure

for a part
where i play a man who

i have get it


i have get it

it be plain and simple
extraordinary mind need
extraordinary stimulation
without
that stimulus they wither and die
therefore there be only one
logical conclusion
i must create a
new superhero

yeah maybe that be not such hot
idea

prepare for operation superhero
genesis

prepare the subject

plato pour the toxic waste

drainage

but aside from that everything

strength

Stenwick

this have proven to be a challenge
i just do not know what i want
what
do i want


i want a man of moral fiber with a
strong sense of right and wrong
someone who do not seek power
instead they must have it thrust
upon they and find within
themselves the courage to rise to
the occasion

yeah well it sound like what you
want be Uberman

that be it
why make a copy when the
real thing will do

thing that give Uberman he
superhuman power

gun and have this idea to use this
to clone a whole army of evil
Ubermen

that

you could master

sandwich
it might have be okay
at first but i just make it
bitter

person

we be just in the
area
i be just trying to

i have be in this business long
enough to know pretty well what you
be just trying to do
besides
i hear you could not take the big
game anymore and be put on fluff
detail

you be not going to take that from
he be you

he be right
old habit i guess
we will get out of you way

besides i be sure there be a pancake
supper somewhere that need
covering

for month now since the death of
Uberman the citizen of metro city
have be holding out for a hero
well it appear they will not have to
hold out for much long as a new
costume crusader have suddenly
storm onto the scene
today at
the metro saving and trust a
mask mystery man singlehandedly
defeated the fab four gang
just
who be this new cape avenger


i be sure all of we viewer be now
wonder what be the stand
for

it be a message to all the scum out
there
Uberman may be go but
metro city have a new protector and
he name be tighten


how do you spell that

oh for heaven sake
i can not
believe it

no matter i suppose

we have now fully establish titan
as metro Citys hero
they will
love he just as they loved
Uberman
everything be going
accord to plan

jail


you know einstein maybe i should
have called you socrates
he also
do not know when to keep his
thought to himself

of this
i mean why be we
create another superhero when it
be such a pain in the ass for you
to get rid of the other one
i
mean Uberman be destroyed we
should be use this opportunity
to
to

to what

i do not know
to take over the
weather space the world
whatever super villain be
to do

the reason someone like you will
always be a minion be because you
have no foresight
we take over the
earth like you said
then what
woman
car
money
even the
grand treasure will lose they
lustre if you do not have someone to
hold they over

that be it
this balance of the
force bullshit be get way too
oprah for i
i be blowing
who be
with i

you dare

i be sick of wearing
stupid costume and i be sick of
working for a super villain who be
turning into a softie

inhuman monster now look at you

it
well i want to get a few
thing off i chest first

of all the inconsiderate do you
have any idea how long we wait
for you
we be you even planning on
coming to i and get revenge

well at first i be going to
you
know because that be what i figure
i be suppose to do
but then i
get to think

you get to think
there be
nothing to think about
i be the
villain
i do something bad you
come and get i

i get to think
what be the
point

maybe you be right
what be the
point


what be these

that be what i wanted to talk to you
about

where do you get all this

get this
i steal they

from where

from all over
you see once you
killed pat and ruined i other
apartment build i be pretty
pissed off so i figure i would go
find you and kick some ass
then i
think to myself
okay then
what
i mean if we be to fight
what would i get out of it
would i
get i apartment back
would i be
able to pay the bill

well what about you mentor

tell you the truth
he be kind of
a dick
i mean be a hero be
dandy and all but it be volunteer
work
now you have always have the
right take on all this
i mean
when you rob a bank or take over
the diamond exchange you get
something out of it
i mean when
you do not get catch which no
offense be not very often
and that
bring i to what i wanted to
propose to you
who could catch you
if i be by you side

you want to teamup


you get the brain i get the
brawn
we could even call ourselves
that
brain and brawn
look at
this

i even design we some new
costume

see you would be brain so you get a
little one on you costume and
then i will have brawn on mine
once
i figure out the good you know
visual interpretation of it
what
do you think

what do i think

i think you be probably the big
idiot i have ever meet
i mean i
can not believe you
all you gift
all you power and all you want
to use they for be you own
financial fulfillment
you know
what
you kind of people make i
sick

i worked hard on this

oh gee i be so sorry


of all the people to pick it have
to be this loser

now hold on
you be going a little
too far

i wish you mother said that to
you father the night of you
conception they would have saved
i a whole lot of heartache

hey i mean it

oh yeah
what be you going to do

master



it hurt

what hurt

it


i do not need you i do not need
anybody
i have the power to do and
take anything i want
and now i be
going to take back everything this
city owe i
beware metro city
it be time for titan to collect

oh and from now on i be going to
i

how do the plan go boss

i just make myself redundant old
friend

it be not that bad

morning tighten

morning

be there something we can do for
you


oh do not bother about i
i be just
here to make a withdrawal

say do he just rob we

not sure
sort of look it do not
it

yeah

should i you know stop he

umm
yeah

looking down at the
guard
he do rob we do not he



absolute power corrupt
absolutely
when lord acton stated
that in a letter to bishop mandell
creighton in no one think
much about it but today metro city
be reel from that very prophecy
tighten who many thought of as we
savior have turn he back on the
because of justice


i do not understand it
he seem to
have every characteristic we be
looking for in a superhero

well there be no use crying about
it now we must take action
i be
not going to play second fiddle to
that crass buffoon
we must destroy
tighten


it will not be easy
Uberman have a
sense of decency and genuine love
for the people
that be he
weakness and be easily used
against he

yes but he possess the same
flaw present in Ubermans
copper
it be like benjamin franklin
always say
if something work
do not dick with it


i can have anything i want
i be
like a god

point to any woman in this bar
i
could have she in a second

hey you want to get with this

buddy what do you want

what do you want
that be the
question be not it
i mean what do
you want when you can have
everything


i suppose what i really want be to
never be forgotten again
i want to
do something that can never be cast
aside or oneupped
i want a
what be it called
legacy
i
want a legacy
yeah that be it
i
like the sound that

i mean what do you want to drink

oh



you time have come to an end
titan

what

there can be only one master
criminal in this city and it be
i

really

i guess i should leave town then
huh

i have a good idea

that be copper i good man
you one
weakness


for all you amazing gift of brawn
you be no match for i intellect

you know what
you be nothing but a
bug
not even worth i effort

he be not as dumb as i think

i guess not
funny though

what be funny

funny Uberman do not think of the
same thing

that be it


hello legacy

hey that be i ball

that be a close one
sixth floor
please

wow i always think Uberman be
you first superhero but it look
like we little roxanne dated a
linebacker in college

that be i diary

so it be


it be personal

well then i would not leave it in
you underwear drawer for just
anyone to find

what do you want

i need you help

so you knock i out and tie i to a
chair

you be not going to like what i be
about to tell you

it be chaos here in city square as
city police

he be really out of control

tell i about it

i should have known
you have
something to do with this do not
you
with titan turning evil


well the evil thing he do by
himself
i goal be to give
purpose by create an intellectual
spar partner

you be talking like you make he

and they call i master mind

let i get this straight
you
missed get you ass kick so
you make a new guy to kick you
ass
that be pathetic

in hindsight

and he power they be just like
Ubermans
why would he have his
power

i have some left over from
something
i infuse he with it



yeah that be why i decided to tie
you up

you do all this because you wanted
purpose

he seem nice


closer
i want to show the people
i real face

recognize i

hal stewart
he be the guy we
thought saved that woman and kid
turn out he be just trying to
save he own ass

yeah good to know

that be right i be really hal
stewart
former hero and bowl
teacher at kingpin bowl

you picked a bowler to give super
power to

it be a modest profession


with i new find power i have
recently start to wonder what
sort of legacy i should leave
should i be a hero
i tried that
once before even saved a lady and
she baby from be squashed
i be
treated like a god until everyone
start to shit on i okay so
what if i do not purposely save
they

well i be going to make something
that can not be taken away from i
i be going to create a permanent
monument to i greatness
one that
will not be so easily forgotten or
erase

i intend to create a new category
in the guinness book of world
record by rolling the big
strike in the history of bowl

i thank to the city planning
commission
this would not have be
possible without they

tell you friend and family to
tune in right here to this station
at noon tomorrow

i god he be nut
Thatll destroy
the whole business triangle


what

i lair be in the direct path of
the ball

oh real nice
would not want
anything to happen to you hideout
would we

you do not understand
i have
certain equipment that be that be
highly unstable

what do you mean

i sort of have a hydrogen reactor
okay

reactor

it be experimental only one in the
world
well how do you think i
power all i invention
someone
like i can not pay for electricity
the bill would be outrageous



it create times the output of
a nuclear one
if destroyed it
could

vaporize the entire city

Pshaw
the whole eastern seaboard
actually
that little baby be
amazing
i be quite proud of it


i mean
we would well find a way to
stop he

do Uberman have a hideout

what

cave a solitary fortress of some
kind
mon all hero have a place
to hang they cape up in
roxanne
it may be we only chance to find
something a clue anything that
could give we a fight chance

it be under he house

whose house

wayne scotts

wayne scott
Uberman be wayne
scott
wayne scott the wealthy
philanthropist
but he disappeared

he disappeared just over two month
ago when you killed he
not only
do you rid the world of a hero
you killed a kind noble generous
man


look like you get what you always
wanted
Uberman be out of the
picture and metro city be doomed

metro city doomed
you know i
never think i would say something
like this but here it go

not if i have anything to say about
it

such a dark place for one such as
you
i wonder underneath you
noble deed what inner demon
drive you to you endless crusade
for justice

good lord man
you have only be
dead for two month


disguise so simple it be
ingenious
no wonder i never caught
on

two live yet in both you be an
ideal
perhaps it be you who be
victorious in the end old friend

i will miss how predictable you be

hello
anyone here
besides
all
the who be with i now

what be the bad you be going to find


the man be a boy scout not a
serial killer






Ahhhhhh

jesus

what the hell be you do here


i might just ask you the same
question
i have think i
incinerate you

you scare the bejesus out of i
how do you figure out i be still
alive
wait how do you know i
identity

roxanne told i
as for you ruse
i forget to line the bottom of the
copper cage somebody pointed that
out to i recently
figure if they
could do it so could you
but one
thing i could not figure out

the skeleton
something i
borrow from a medical school a
few month before

few month
how long have you be
planning this

i always planned to retire
eventually
i mean come on you
can not do this sort of thing in you
fifties
you would just look
ridiculous

i see it all so clearly now



you must have do it just second
before the observatory exploded




you bear out from under the cage
then use you UberSpeed



you make you way to safety
where you have the skeleton safely
hidden away somewhere


then you must have fly to a safe
distance and wait for the
explosion then

man you smart

but why fake you death
why go
through all of it
you could have
just quit

but the responsibility would still
be there


cop can retire and stop hand
out speed ticket but people
expect more from superheroe
i
tell you a volcano could not erupt
in zimbabwe without everyone
expect i to do something about
it
i figure out of sight out of
mind

and wayne scott
why do he have to
disappear

both of i live have so much
baggage
it be time for new baggage
you know

i just can not believe it
this whole
time you have be in hide while a
force of great evil be tearing you
city apart

i do not want to hear about it
that be why i do not have a
television in here to remind i of
all the thing i be do
hell i could get a wife to do
that

there be a demented supervillain out
there about to destroy we i
mean you city

you be really going to do nothing

good and evil have a way of
balance themselves out
if this
guy be as bad as you say somebody
will rise up to fight he
it be
just the order of thing
you find
i do not you


i know it be hard but you will find
someone else someday

you be the only one who can stop
he

could not if i wanted to
get to a
plane to catch

plane

go to barbados for a little
change in climate
now if you will
excuse i i get to go pack

you be a good foe
i be sorry if
i have let you down
if it make a
difference you be the good foe a
hero could ask for

not smart enough to come up with a
fullproof trap

well you do almost have i when
you figure out i weakness be
copper
now that make i sweat a
little
take i way too long to
drill out from under that cage

i get lucky

anyway it be a good thing for i
sake that i could always count on
you for an out


what do you mean

mon we always threw each other a
couple of bone
you would always
leave i an out in one of you
fullproof trap and i would never
have you incarcerate at a
penitentiary that you could not
eventually escape from
it keep we
little game going

game
be that all this ever be
to you
you know i be trying i
best every time i fight you
those
out as you call they be
unintentional

oh

something now that would really
piss you off
i be going to go
against everything you ever taught
i
i hope
i hope that maybe
you will look down at what i be about
to do as not so much a good deed
but more like the outright defiance
of a hateful and ungrateful son
if you could do that then maybe
in you own little way you could
for probably the first time find
a reason to be proud of i
