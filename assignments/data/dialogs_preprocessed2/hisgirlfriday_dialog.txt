important to the mayor of this town

especially with an election coming
up in a few day

be you sure williams be not all
there

all you have get to do be talk to he
but the mayor would hang he own
grandmother to be reelect

but could not you show the man be not
responsible

there be a sly
expression on his
face

you could run an interview that would
prove it
remember the interview i
write with jimmy wellman
that saved
he life

slap hand
together
yes you could do it Hildy
you
could save that poor devil life
you could but
the enthusiasm die
away
you be going away
i forget

how long would the interview take

oh an hour for the interview
another hour to write it

we could take the six of the clock train
Hildy
if it would save a mane life

no bruce dear
do not you see
this
be a trick to get you sympathy
no
walter i have be waiting for

sure when you would spring it
if you
want to save earl williams life
you can interview he yourself
you be
still a good reporter
bruce and i
will be on that four of the clock train
and thank just the same

i be an editor
i know what ought to
be written but i can not write it the
way you could
it need a woman
heart

why walter you be get poetic

you see what i have to put up with

you argue with
she otherwise you be going on a
honeymoon with blood on you hand

how can you have any happiness after

remember that a man go to the
gallows because you be too selfish
to wait two hour
i tell you earl
williams face will come between you
on the train tonight and at the
preacher tomorrow and all the
rest of you live

what a performance
bravo

he fool you bruce it be only an
act

i could not kill anybody
it be against everything i have ever
stand for
they know it be an
accident
they be not hanging i for
that they be hanging i for i
belief

what be you belief earl

they be very simple
i believe in
the golden rule
i be not the first
man to die for preaching it
but if
they would only listen to it we
could have a fine decent world
instead of this mass of hate that
make man do such cruel thing

how would you go about apply the
golden rule earl

i would do away with the profit system
and have production for use only
there be enough food and clthe and
shelter for everybody if we would use
some sense

production for use only
well
maybe that be the answer

it be the only answer
everything have
a use and if we let it be used for
it purpose we could solve all we
problem
food be mean to be eat
not stored away in restaurant while
poor people starved
clthe be
mean to be worn not pile up in
store while people go naked
do not that make sense

yes that make a lot of sense earl

just use thing for what they be
mean that be all

sure
she study he a
moment
what be the purpose of a gun earl

gun

reveal smile break
out
why to shoot of course

be that how you come to shoot the
policeman

sure
you see i would never have a gun
in i hand before and i do not know
what to do with it
well when i get
stick i know that there be an answer
for everything in production for
use
so it come to i in a flash
what be a gun for
to shoot
