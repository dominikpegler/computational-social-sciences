yeh well they do not insure it
so they do not
have
to solve this
to they it be a crime
to we it be
mil less reinsurance which be

only thirty percent gin

which be why you be on this

he come in through the window

that be not possib

what be not possible be entry through
the door or the vent
that would
have trigger instant alarm

the window be wired too

only for trauma
they used smart
glass where the sensor respond to
violation of the panel integrity

i think he scale the wall pop
the frame
in one piece

then he only have to deal with
heat and motion sensor
they
be on second delay so the
owner would not trigger the alarm
just be walking arou

the pane weigh pound the
build foot high

this particular guy be the good
the good there ever be

pop the frame would trigger
the alarm

i write a program and run it dumbo

here how i figure it out

no one arrange flower like that
it be the draft from the window

you said
this particular guy

he be be out of the business
for ten
year

maybe not
no one ever prove
hell even
arrested
he for
stealing
anything
but we all
know
he be numero ichiban for
thirty year
why not forty

why
because of the bozo switch

tion

all necessary confirmation
code to transfer reasonably modest
sum
out
of those account

modest

two or three million at a crack
in odd number
total eight
billion

little homage to Limeyland there

dear
the
account
will not
reconcile

wrong
the instruct the computer
to
overreport
all account total
forever in the exact amount we have
lift
so the chinese think the
money still there

the money
be still
miss

sure the foreign bank know
they send out some money
but
they think hong kong know it
too
and since we be leaving
plenty
in
every account

the shit do not splatter
