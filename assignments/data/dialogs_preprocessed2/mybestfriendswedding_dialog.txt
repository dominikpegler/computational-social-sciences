i classmate angelique shattered
she pelvis line dancing in
Abeline on spring break

be i maid of honor

you can not believe what it would
cost to bring in a temp

uh
how about promoting a
bridesmaid
someone you know
for at least fortyfive minute

the bridesmaid be i only two
female relative under forty
identical twin debutante from
nashville who be basically
vengeful slut
with amazing
body

which be the disqualify
factor

the twin part
i like to remain
impartial in i contempt

this mean i have four day
to make you i new good friend

and since i already know everything
about you
including intimate
fact i be mortify to have hear
but too envious to forget
it be
time for you to learn about i

force yourself
to get personal

sound like a plan

if you would rather the lilac

i think bridesmaid have to wear
the same dress

not you
you will not be comfortable
unless you be distinctive

what else do he tell you

you hate wedding you never go

you be not up for anything
conventional or popularly
assumed to be female priority
including marriage
or romance
or even

not even love

the wrong fit
right from the
start

he said that too

favor okay

i know
it sound like three
favor

but when you think about it

do not you will





do not












uh unit four baker charlie
how we cookin on that Skokiie
infestation






copy dispatcher





uh what happen if you get
that methylethyl shit on
you hand






uh you get maybe thirty second
before you be sterile
for god
sake do not touch yourself or
anything

i




uh this be one monkey zebra
it be not bee in the gale
wall it be cat



she say gas they anyway
she will pay cash
uh
how
do i pay this





do not speak

uh
i see that move

do not

i have to make a confession
another confession
besides
that i love you
this be even
badly

the email
you think walter
send you boss
i write that

you be not saying you actually
you be saying that y

write it yeah
i be the
bad guy







i mean do you realize what
you have
well of course you
realize that be why you be
confess i mean
i mean
how could you do that

i do not know it would get
send
i just wanted you to
get mad at kimmy
and

i have do nothing but slimy
underhanded despicable not
even terribly imaginative
thing
ever since i get
here
trying to

to win you
to win you
back

and i be blinded by love
like you said

but that do not excuse any
part of it
i be pond scum

actually
low
i be the fungus
that feed on pond scum
low
the layer of mucous that cruds up
the fung

low

low

the pus that infect the mucous
that cruds up the fungus

on the other hand thank you

for loving i that much that
way

it be pretty flatter

except it make i fungus

well that part i know

so you have to marry kim
because she will actually make
you happy
i in contrast am
a shallow neurotic psychopath
with relatively little to offer

kim
nod you head
do as
you be tell

just promise you will never tell
i who you would have chosen
if i have not confess

cos if you would have chosen i
then i threw away a perfectly
good life
just to be a decent
person
which be a questionable
tradeoff
right

and if you would have chosen
some yearold punk over i
i would have to kill myself

i will take it to i grave

i be so glad you do not jump on
that train before

i come here looking for she

why would she come here

this be where i proposed

i have to cover a game in
milwaukee
she see i off
and when the train start to
leave
i jump up on the
step i help the handle and
without

without a thought in i head
i shouted marry i


and she gasp and covered she
mouth and the train be pulling
out and suddenly she scream

just once
and blow i a
kiss

i never forget that

it be two week

almost three

that be so romantic

i just wonder if you know why

it be because romance be not
mystery and trick and doubt
and halting unspoken longing
that be not the real romance

the real romance be saying yes

would have be a nice wedding

you can not believe you have lost
she
sooner or later you will
find she and you will look in
each other eye and you will
see all that love

course if it be later rather
than sooner i would hate to be you
at six of the clock
you have get a lot of explaining
to

i be just think of how she be
hurting
lose
alone
like
she life be over

that be little egotistical

but undoubtedly accurate

okay we will split up
you go
to every romantic place you
guy have i will go
someplace
brilliant and the first one
who

if you find she

the kiss
may be hard
for
you to explain
because the only fear she
really have be

i yeah
and she like
tommy Lasorda
case closed

but if you do get to she first

there be something you be
authorized to say



wallace egregious residence
mandy speak

it be jules you guy have not
have a call from say kimberly
have you



oh she be slipped out the
little monkey
Probly with
michael do the nasty



or crying in she nacho down
at Comskey park

excuse i



i have this crank call
from
some guy who think he see she
i said what would a bride be
do on she wedding

you be so right
what a
nerve on that guy
bring i
dress to church huh

i want to pick up a little
something for the ceremony

she would not confide in i
so i called the house

luckily i get she cousin

go to the john she said

could be there awhile




i





sob
in here you bitch

let i in baby or i will rip
this damn thing off it non
codecompliant hinge




i be going to



still sob
over here nitwit

incoming

pitiful

have not you do enough

in one minute
you be going
to feel so foolish

do not


have you ever hear of
irony

i threw i arm around you
husband
and kiss he with
all i heart
because i be
so happy
for you
nitwit

he be going to take
the job

with you dad yeah
can you
guess why
bitch



well of course he love
you

hell even i love you

i never want to go through this
again

that be entirely understandable



shit


whatever hap

we be bonding we lose track
we be officially sorry now
let we put it behind we

believe i we get a bride who be
worth waiting for yes

out of we way

do not worry sugar

when he look at you it will
be as if

he be never see a woman
before

leave foot

michael and kimmy write these
word
she ask i to confide
mostly michael

so he get to say they

why do people get marry
anymore



why not live together amicably
with no sense of obligation
beyond the moment



as long as the sex be good
as
long as no one more interesting
have wander into view
as long
as the thousand conflict of two
individual will remain
comfortably compromise



and when one feel the urge to
move on to explore the new
no guilt no disgrace no
promise break



no agony of have dishonored
a time
when we heart
and
the world be different



marriage be a lot to put up
with



the answer must be
that there
be some need basic to the human
heart
that embracing
the obligation
of commitment
fulfill



some need to belong to one another
in a way which rage against the
notion
that all be impermanent
against the notion of mortality



we love be big
and longer
than life itself

that be what we want
and marriage
be what we do about it

we be fool in this
thank
god almighty

boy that be good

michael and kim also edit what
they want i to say

the idea be we be only marry
once
we have to remember it
forever
let we keep to the good
stuff
you may kiss the bride



if anyone here can show just because
why this man and woman should not
be marry speak now
or forever
hold you peace

kimberly
i promise to love
and respect and comfort you
to hear you voice and you
heart
until we be part
by death

michael
i promise to love and
respect and comfort you
to
hear you voice and you heart
until we be part by death

for the record you each agree
to marry the other

i do

we have not say much about god
this evening i know
but he
be here
and he be happy
to
bless he wonderful child



in that michael and kimberly have
given themselves to each other by
solemn vow and the exchange
of ring



i pronounce they husband and wife
those whom god have joined together
let no one put asunder



now
kiss the bride

i will slip quietly
away from the noisy crowd when
i see the pale star rising
blooming over the oak

through the pale twilit meadow
with only this one dream

but this be on loan
until
