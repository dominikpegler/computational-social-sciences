foreigner


home to thousands of westerner
and other nonSaudis who work in
the kingdom there have be
several attack on these compound
in the last five year
as such
they have become very tight in
term of security with both the
saudi national guard and police
taking command

into a vest
pound of

they get it
semtex or
they could get it
the third there
god know
that crater look like
a plane drop a pounder

obviously a secondary blast after
the initial device used to lure
first responder to the scene
do not know anything about where or
what it be yet

this be how they do it


i already know the answer but any
chance in hell we get to go over
there use we hand

if you already know the answer
adam why ask the question

we be not seeing this kind of
planning and execution anywhere
else
these be not hotwired
artillery shell waiting for
Humvees to roll by
these hit be coordinated
planning time and big broad
daylight ball

almost trancestudying
the image
yeah so
do they all happen
during daylight

yes
at least the first part of
the attack

we have two other

very
sophisticated
command and control

large kill zone they could and
they do it
they do it by be
patient

any rumor or confirmation of
uniform be used in the other
two attack

on control and detonation
coordination

if there be ever a time to get
boot on saudi sand
sykes study leavitt with what be best described as
substantial skepticism
fleury circle sykes name on his
roster

they can not afford to appear as if
they be losing any kind of
control
they lose control over
they country they people
then
they risk losing control over the
oil
they will not let we in
no way

from the state department one hour

saudi security assessment that any
additional american presence on
kingdom soil represent reckless
risk
therefore it be the secretary
of states position that only after

bureau of investigation activate
rapid deployment

the national security advisor and
the attorney general agreed

everyone terrify so nothing
move
paralysis
you and you team
be not going anywhere
and this meet be just a circle
jerk ronnie
attorney general
youngs going to go through the
motion because protocol say we
get an appeal
we will be on record
but expect nothing more
nothing from fleury

can you handle this
keep you
mouth shut when people way above
you say thing you will hate


yeah sure
no problem

re
janet
what about agent mayes

fleury grace and mayes enter
handsomely decorated
expansive
a lifetime of notable handshake framed in black
and white

answer

Maricella
Canavesio deputy national security advisor white house

i apologize if we be late

they be early

you know special agent fleury

i do


this be agent janet mayes she be
one of we arabic expert


the late

two suicide bomber
rumor they
be dressed as saudi police
we
believe this be the work of saudi
terrorist named abu hamza

go on

shooter crew serve as
distraction
after the initial
attack there be a lull to allow
saudi emergency team
and we own
attach
to collect
then a
secondary blast be trigger
aim at those first responder
so
they target family and rescuer
with one attack
mildly sarcastic

i think that be a clear signal that
they definition of enemy be
expand

i god

let we never forget how cheap life
be over there
now
i have seven
minute before i next meet so
who be talking first
to fleury and grace slow
like a kindergarten
teacher

you two digested the memo


i will go first if that be okay
Maricella
first i be sorry about fran manner

as we be about rex burr

i meet with prince Thamer at the
saudi embassy fifteen minute after
i hear this morning news
after
speaking with Thamer i advised we
withhold additional personnel
because a big part of the religious
justification for these bomb be
the presence of current
personnel
more boot on saudi soil
make an already combustible
situation more so
i know that be
not the answer you want but

i two cent
the saudi have not
ask for help
sound like
they have do just the opposite
if
we force the issue that could
**further/far anger an utterly important
ally that share a mile long
border with iraq

it be all rocksolid logic

we would just like to be on record
as saying we think we should go
as soon as possible

that be not going to happen


mock sincerity to the
room

so as we present this to the
public let we as best we can
try to view this through an
agent eye
beat
to grace

and please let i know if there be
anything else we can do for you

sir how would you imagine it look
view through an agent eye

pardon i

i be interest in how you think
this situation be view through
we eye

it be some variation on vengeance
when one of you own be killed
agent lose they analytical power
kind of a great strength
great weakness thing

if i wanted vengeance i would have
whispered rex burr into Elliss
ear right when we walk in

this be not terrorism madam
it be
just serial murder

what be the distinction


to call this massacre an act of
terrorism
that imply a
specific political agenda
to i
these killing be so futile and
unbalance that they feel utterly
sociopathic more like charles
manson than Osama bin laden

beat fuck it
go
al Qaeda lost the first phase of
this war so a new zerosum phase
have begin
if you will not join we
we will let loose the truly talented
murderer
abu hamza
he will
kill so many of you that the
result humiliation of the saudi
royal family will because an exodus
a rebellion both
because the
royal family simply cannot protect
you or yours any longer

when she say talented she be not
talking about the walkingbombs who
can sneak past any and all
security nor the hijacker tough
enough to take an airliner
we be
talking about the man who teach
they how

the operational commander who
organize train plan
encourage
that be who we be
fight

if we do not get inside saudi arabia
within hour there be no chance
we catch the killer responsible for
AlRahmah
none


okay
i believe it all
so do not
you team in that country represent
the kind of target one of these
master would die for
trade ten
of they own for one of you

to not engage these criminal out
of fear for we personal safety be
just another way of saying uncle

fleury take another deep breath

i will say it another way
evidence
start to go cold after twenty four
hour
if we can not get in now we
will not find the man or man
responsible for this crime
we
could not do it at Khobar
we
could not do it in yemen
we have
barely scratch the surface in
iraq
and we be on verge of not
do it here
they be get
strong we be get weak
i
just lost a very good friend and i
would very much like to go and do
i job
beat

that be spirit
let we all
thank god special agent fleury
do not make policy decision
he would
turn the into Pattons third
army
young stand
fleury contemplate careerending violence
janet fleury and grace walking the row of sevenfoot bronze

fearful of the pioneer thought
this committee and i have tried to
imbue
it be thus an agency at
contretemps hindering we every
effort
and by committee i mean
the fuck


senator

glad to hear it
so can we get in
there

no
sykes hold AlGhazis gaze
smile


fleury be taking in the entire crime scene

the mud bag it himself search for someone to give it too

car if they could take it for a
little ride
fleury get in the car checking out ballistic shred in the
back of the passenger seat headr

no they do not

AlGhazi offer the slight of nod to fleury

where be this car when they hit
it
AlGhazi lead we team to the main gate
sykes and fleury
follow close

security be a combination of the
police and military
leavitt and mayes lag behind a bit
leavitt make eye
contact with a behind the
caliber

good news be that if he shoot you
he be going to shoot you sitting on an
american tank
with an american
make bullet
so it be kind of all
in the family



how about we get into those
american suburban
with they
american
AlGhazi continue the tour as fleury once again note the
familiar apartment off in the distance
car port
fleury and team moving around the area
fleury
pick up some break glass from the ground

the car be park here

yes

back in

yes
fleury study the scene

they be attack from the front
must have assumed the killer be
fellow officer
have any of
these man be identified

not yet
we will check certain
neighborhood
it be likely that
the four man pray at the same
mosque

the same mosque be enough to
identify they link they to a cell

yes
if the mosque be in Suweidi

Suweidi


Suweidi be a known militant
stonghold
AlQaeda could recruit
from storefronts

can we go to check out some of
these surround building

why

seem reasonable that the planner
have to observe and base on Hamzas
past history it be consistent that
he would want to video the attack
be that true
be that accurate

that be true

well in order to video in order
to observe you need a view

that build see all three crime
scene

it be outside the wall

mon now
this be insane
we get
enough security to invade Suweidi
let alone that build

no you do not

could you ask


we be already seeing the crime
scene individually why not all
at once

any answer will take

time
i understand
fleury speak slowly and clearly now
like he be cement his
word in he own head as he speak they

you have to ask the general then
the general would ask the prince
do it go high or be that
be
the prince the end of the chain
AlGhazi hesitate can not help but be charmed
fleury clearly
know when to stepon or layoff the gas
he be smooth
and

AlGhazi nod yes to the strange half
question

we will be at the community center
janet want to play hoop
we be in the big gym as we team sit and wait
leavitt tap
on a laptop
janet shoot free throw by herself

this be the kind of radical
circumstance that could have
seriously up Shaqs free throw
percentage
take a man
ship he
off to riyadh
no phone constant
threat of death no girl no hip
hop
nothing
just free throw
Shaq he would be shooting at least
seventy percent
lakers would still
be together
kobe and Shaq lover
forever

how many prince be there

over

who pay for all this

general motor ford chevrolet

flight the accommodation
lite
subject
if he offer you the
chance to hold he raptor do not
flinch
it be a compliment

to grant
genuine worry
what be a raptor
damon schmidt appear
the prince sit on a sea of pillow
there be several small
flat screen playing business report and AlJazeera
see from behind the prince
everyone but leavitt standing
next to face we have never see

super


that be i most prolific hunter
i be
trying to teach he friend there
by example but i fear it be
something you be born with or not
do you agree mr
ronald
innate or
not at all

i do

nodding
i could tell
what have you see so far of we
kingdom
and know i can arrange
tour anywhere within we border

i have see that the man who planned
the bad crime in you kingdom
history be without a doubt saudi

and that if you walk
kilometer from the compound you
will find a rooftop where the
attack be planned
i have see
that the person in this room born
with it be right there
point at a gawking al
ghazi
everything i just said come from
colonel AlGhazi
he observation
of the scene while he be
protecting we
and i think you be
absolutely right sir
that kind of
instinct can not be taught
not to
falcon
definitely not to
general
innate or not at all
you want the murder to stop as much
as i do
let we help


colonel AlGhazi a word

that be impressive

think it will work

yeah
maybe
i mean you can only
play the i be going to the press
card like three more time
so
maybe

they be paranoid and overly self
protective

they be not protecting anyone
there be no conspiracy
they be just
terrify
finally
the saudi have
finally see the monster they
helped create because those
monster have come home
and if
saudi do not catch saudi monster
that be the end

right through Fleurys
attempt to speak
and that end could come double
quick if they let the Shaytan
catch those monster for they
because that be what the saudi on
the street suspect
the only thing
keeping the royal family upright be
american evil
