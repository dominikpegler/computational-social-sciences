government

do not worry it be not about you
business
indicate the
artifact
they be from the army

i have already serve

army intelligence
they be looking
for abner

but you do study under professor
Ravenwood at the university of
chicago

we have not spoken in ten year
i be
afraid we have a bit of a falling
out

you know nothing of he whereabouts

just rumor
somewhere in asia last
i hear

maybe dr
jones can make sense of
it

well
you must understand dr
jones this be all strictly
confidential

i understand

yesterday one of we european
section intercepted a nazi communique
from cairo to berlin
we do not quite
know what to make of it

here it be tanis development
proceeding
acquire headpiece staff
of ra general Tengtu Hok shanghai
locate abner Ravenwood you



tanis
they must have discover the
lose ruin

tanis
be not that something

frankly we be a little suspicious
an american be mention so
prominently in a secret nazi cable

ah Ravenwoods no nazi

then what do they want he for

they be looking for the headpiece to
the staff of ra

but it say here that be in china

only half of it
Ravenwood have the
other half

what would the nazi want with this
this staff of ra

i can tell you that
over the last
two year the nazi have have team
of archeologist running around the
world looking for all kind of
religious artifact

that be right
hitlers a nut on the
subject
crazy
he be obsess with
the occult

what be this staff of ra anyway

it all have to do with the ark of the
covenant
the army guy look
mystify
the chest the hebrew used to carry
around the ten commandment

an egyptian pharaoh steal the ark
from jerusalem and take it back to
the city of tanis
short time later
tanis be consume by the desert in
a sandstorm that last a year
but
before that the pharaoh have have the
ark hidden away in a secret chamber
called the well of the soul
which
be where the staff of ra come in

now this be rather clever
the staff
be really just a big stick oh i
do not know say like this
he indicate about
six foot
no one really know for sure
any
way it be capped by an elaborate
headpiece with a carve of the sun
at the top
what you have to do be
take the staff to a special map room
in tanis it have the whole city
laid out in miniature on the floor
when you place the staff in a certain
spot in this room at a certain time
of day the sun would shine through
a hole here in the headpiece and
then send a beam of light down here
to the map giving you the location
of the well of the soul

where the ark of the covenant be
keep

which be probably what the nazi be
after

what be this ark look like

look like
why it be right here

good god

yes
that be what the hebrew think

what be that suppose to be coming
out of there

who know
lightning
fire
the power of god

i be beginning to understand hitlers
interest in this thing

oh yes
the bible tell of it leveling
mountain and wasting entire region
moses promised that when the ark be
with you you enemy will be
scattered and you foe fell before
you
an army which carry the ark before
it be invincible

oh there be one other thing that
hitler undoubtably believe about
the ark
it be say that the lose ark will be
recovered at the time of the come
of the true messiah

dr
jones you have be very helpful
i hope we can call on you again if
we have question

most certainly

i have get to talk to you

this be not really a good time

indy it be important

all right
come on in

i will be in a minute

they want you to go for it
and
they will pay

good work marcus
i have a feel
this would happen
and of course
the museum get the ark when we be
do

of course

okay here the way it be going to be
first i will hightail it to shanghai
and get the piece from general Hok
then i think i know where i can find
Ravenwood
if only i can get

general Hoks a tough customer
they
do not call he the wild boar for
nothing
and he be tied in with the
japanese

i will worry about that when the time
come
i only hope be to find the
well of the soul before the nazi
do

i broke
through myself

those nazi be moving awfully fast

the frenchman be helping they

Belloq
so he get away from the
indian
this be going to be more
interesting that i think

i be afraid this have put the german
close to finding the well of the
soul

indicate the
headpiece
even Belloq will not be able to find it
without that
can you make anything
of those marking
they be nothing
i be familiar with

but i know someone who might
you
can go to see he tomorrow
indy
something bother i

what be it i friend

it be the ark
if it be there at
tanis
it be not something man be
mean to disturb
death have always
surround it

earth

Belloq

good evening dr
jones

i ought to kill you right now

it be not i who bring the girl
into this dirty business

sit down please before you fall
down
we can behave as civilized
people
i be afraid it will be you
last opportunity

not a very private place for a murder

these arab will not interfere in
the white mane business
they do
not care if we kill each other off
take a sip of wine
refer to it
terribly difficult finding a decent
vintage here
you be quite vigorous
in shanghai
unfortunately we friend
the wild boar have taken the precaution
of making several copy of the piece

how odd that be should end this way
for we after so many
stimulate
encounter
i almost regret it
where
shall i find a new adversary so close
to i own level

try the local sewer

i know you despise i
we always
hate in other that which we most
fear in ourselves
and you and i be
very much alike

now you be get nasty

we have always do the same kind of
work
we method have not differ
as much as you pretend
i be a shadowy
reflection of you
but it would have
taken only a nudge to make you the
same as i to push you out of the
light

you know it to be true
how nice
and how ironic the time

do you realize what the ark be
it be a transmitter
radio for
talking to god
and now it be within
i grasp

what about you boss der fuhrer
i
think he be waiting to take
possession

when the time be right
when i be
finished with it

i hope you friend be patient
dangerous work Belloq

yes
very
you may consider yourself
fortunate that you involvement
conclude here

tell i do you get away with the
idol

i be lucky to get away with i life
the Hovitos prove quite narrowminded
about the whole matter

you know if it be god you want to
talk to maybe i can arrange it

you have not changed
but please
do not reach for you weapon until
you be ready to die

expect progress
you lead i to
believe

nothing
i have make no promise

said only that it look very
favorable
perhaps the ark will still
be find in an adjoin chamber
base on the information in we
possession i calculation be
correct
perhaps some bit of evidence
still elude we
perhaps

perhaps the girl can help we

i feel exactly
she be in
possession of the original piece for
year
she may know much
if properly motivated

i tell you she know nothing useful

i be surprise to find you squeamish
that be not you reputation
but it
need not concern you

perfect man for this kind of work

the ark must be in that stone case

we
the girl however have certain
value where we be headed
she will
bring a very good price
if that

i be uncomfortable with the thought
of this
jewish ritual
be you sure it be
necessary

let i ask you this would you be
more comfortable open the ark in
berlin for the fuhrer and find
out only then if the sacred piece
of the covenant be inside
knowing
only then whether you have
accomplished you mission and obtain
the one true ark

hold it
one move from anybody and i blow
that box back to moses

jones you persistence surprise
even i
you be going to give
mercenary a bad name

what about you
talk to god yet

you can escape from this base

that depend on how reasonable we be
all will to be
all i want be the
girl
we will keep possession of the
ark only till we have get safe transport
to england
then it be all yours

if we refuse
