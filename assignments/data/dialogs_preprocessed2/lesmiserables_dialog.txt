Valjean make he way up a rise track a wear knapsack on
he back
he come to a stop at the top of the hill and
there before he light by the rise sun spread a wide
vista of field and town and village stretching into the
distance with the snow capped alps beyond
behind and
below he lie toulon at the sea edge
as we hear the
musical theme we see for the first
time the darkness in he face give way to a new hope

freedom at last
how strange the taste
never forget the year the waste
nor forgive they for what they have
do
they be the guilty everyone
the day begin


and now let we see
what this new world
will do for i
Valjean stride down the long rise road pulling he thin
coat close round he against the cold winter wind
he pass a long line of labourer working
he approach
the

Valjean take he hat off revealing he shave and scar
head

passport
the overseer scan the yellow paper and hand it back

no work here
Valjean slog on up the rise track into the mountain
snow on the ground here and darkness falling
he look up and see ahead a village build on a rock cliff
it light twinkle the snowy mountain rising behind
the tower of it handsome church rise up like a promise of
refuge
this be Digne
Valjean enter Digne
as he drink from the fountain he see
a guard standing outside the mairie

Valjean stand waiting
the officer fastidiously write down
the name of Valjean in he huge ledger and the name of the
town in he passport
the officer sign and stamp the
passport

Valjean
the officer hand back the passport
Valjean leave
Valjean walk down the high street spy the warm glow of an
inn and enter
Valjean sit in the corner he hat low over he head
he
eye hungrily a group of cart driver tuck into a roast
meal by a roar fire place
the innkeeper serve he a
beer
as he reach for it he coat sleeve ride up to
reveal he wrist callouse and scar by manacle
the
innkeeper eye he warily
he discuss Valjean with two
other man then ask for he paper
see the phrase
extremely dangerous
from the yellow paper in the innkeeper
hand up to the innkeeper face
blank stare a shrug of
refusal

i inn be full
Valjean move off wearily through the village
as he pass
down the narrow street face peer at he from doorway
but the door close when he go by
shadowy figure
follow he
word have spread that he be a dangerous mane
passing the uncurtained window of a cottage he come to a
stop
through the window he see a scene that break his
heart
a father at a table by lamplight he young wife
before he he child on either side
nothing special
and yet everything he be never have
he stop at the local jail
an iron chain attached to a bell
hang from the prison door

the grate slide shut
as jeans Valjean walk away some
child who have be following begin throwing stone at
he
he threaten they with he stick and they scatter
he see over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret
Valjean stoop through the doorway and lie down on some
straw
he hear a ferocious growl and see the head of an
enormous mastiff
it be a dog kennel
snow falling as Valjean make he way down the road hungry
weary moving slowly he trousers ripped and bloody from
where the dog have bitten he
at the end of a road the snowcovered church
beside it a
dark churchyard
Snowcovered gravestone in moonlight
exhausted Valjean
collapse to the ground and huddle himself into the
shelter of a doorway
lantern glow in the dark
the lantern approach
throwing shadow
it little circle of light come to rest
on the crumple figure of Valjean
he stir and open he eye
the glow of the lantern in the darkness
beyond it the halfseen feature of a kind old man
the

the bishop lead Valjean to a bedroom where the wall be
also painted with religious imagery
across the passage
Valjean see the open door to the bishop own bedroom
there the housekeeper be putting the table silver away in a
cupboard
he turn to see a bed make up with clean white linen
waiting for he
he have not sleep in such a bed ever in his

the bishop turn away to go to sleep

you let i sleep here next to you
how do you know i be not a murderer
Valjean laugh a strange laugh

god will take care of that

Valjean lie on the bed fully dressed deeply asleep
outside a dog bark
Valjeans eye snap open
the first thing he see by the
light of the moon be an image of god the father gazing down
on he from the painted ceiling
in panic fear
judgement he sit bolt upright
then he look round and
remember
he get out of bed and open the door
there across the narrow passage the door stand open to
the bishops bedroom
in the moonlight he see the bishop
lying asleep
above he bed the cupboard where the silver
be keep
Valjean move silently into the bishops room holding a
metal miner spike which he pull from he bag
the floor
board creak
he look down at the old man holding he
breath but the bishop be peacefully and innocently asleep
he reach up to the cupboard
it be unlock
the cupboard
door open with a sharp crack sound
the bishop
disturbed in he sleep move a little
at once Valjean be
over he like a wild animal spike raised to strike should

the bishop sleep on
the moon come out and
light up he beautific smile face
Valjean be throw
he turn back and open the cupboard door fully
there be
the silver

carefully he pick it out fearful of every clink
one last
look at the sleep old man and he make a run for the
door
Valjean rush out of the back door of the house
he
cross the graveyard scramble over a back wall and he be
go
the bishop be coming in from morning mass in he vestment
when the door burst open and two policeman drag Valjean
before he
Valjean hang he head unable to meet the
bishop eye

monsignor we caught the thief
redhand

and leave
Valjean utterly bewilder take the silver candlestick

but remember this i brother

you must use this precious silver
to become an honest man
by the witness of the martyr


by the passion and the blood
god have raised you out of
darkness
i have buy you soul for god
Valjean kneel in the church
he take out he yellow passport and stare at it
he turn towards the altar and the crucifix above it

what have i do
sweet jesus what have i do
become a thief in the night
become a dog on the run
and have i fallen so far
and be the hour so late
that nothing remains but the cry
of i hate
the cry in the dark that nobody
hear
here where i stand at the turn
of the year
if there be another way to go
i missed it twenty long year
ago
i life be a war that could
never be win
they give i a number and
murdered Valjean
when they chain i and left i
for dead
just for stealing a mouthful of
bread
yet why do i allow this man
to touch i soul and teach i
love
he treated i like any other
he give i he trust
he called i brother
i life he claim for god
above
can such thing be
for i have come to hate the world
this world that always hated i
take an eye for an eye
turn you heart into stone
this be all i have live for
this be all i have known
one word from he and i would be back
beneath the lash upon the rack
instead he offer i i freedom


i feel i shame inside i like a
knife
he told i that i have a soul
how do he know
what spirit come to move i
life
be there another way to go
slowly he examine the yellow passport and raise it high
as if to the altar

i be reaching but i fall
and the night be closing in
as i stare into the void
to the whirlpool of i sin
Valjean stand and turn walking fast to the door of the
church

i will escape now from that world
from the world of jeans Valjean
jeans Valjean be nothing now
Valjean come out of the church into the graveyard and
reach a bell set on the edge of a promontory
below lie
the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley
below

another story must begin
he rip the yellow paper into piece and throw the piece
out over the valley
the scrap flutter in the wind
the scrap of yellow paper as they dance in the wind
then fall away into the void below
one scrap of paper
dance upwards in the sunlight
we follow this and
accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne
far below towards the sun gloriously breaking through the
heaven with the alp beyond
the camera then start to
tumble back down through mist and cloud below through
time and space down to discover
the camera hurtling towards three horse riding down a long
muddy road on a flat plain towards the wall town of
MontreuilsurMer
montreuil sit on an estuary leading out
to the sea
we see ship sitting in low tide on the mud of
the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick
factory building


eight year later
MontreuilsurMer
the camera close in to ground level to reveal the
horseriders
Javert flank by two policeman
as the rider enter the wall town we see the poor clustered
around the gate destitute and sick people clammering to
get in

at the end of the day you be
another day old
and that be all you can say for
the life of the poor
it be a struggle
it be a war
and there be nothing that anyone
giving
one more day standing about
what be it for
one day less to be live
Javert see the destitution of the people
expressionless
as ever

at the end of the day you be
another day cold
and the shirt on you back
do not keep out the chill
and the righteous hurry past
they do not hear the little one
crying
and the plague be coming on fast
ready to kill
one day near to dying
a plague victim wrapped in a shroud be throw
onto a cart
the police enter the harbour
the beggar be push back as the gate open and close for
the police


at the end of the day there be
another day dawning
and the sun in the morning be
waiting to rise
like the wave crash on the sand
like a storm that break any
second
there be a hunger in the land
there be a reckon still to be
reckon
and there be going to be hell to pay
at the end of the day
Javert look round at the factory building the boat in
the harbour the poor clamour behind he and ride on

stride in through the door gesture to a cart driver
who be taking a quick rest on a crate

impressive sight

the narrow street turn and open out onto the river
Valjean stop

round they packed with soldier in they thousands so many
that we know the little band can never win

entraps it have become a small pool of darkness in the
centre of the bright light of paris
the sun still below the rooftop
every house be tightly
shuttered
Grantaire be fast asleep in the upstairs room dead drunk

Enjolras reenters the barricade through the secret gate

crack a face peep and it close again

the people have not hear
yet we will not abandon those who
cannot hear
let we not waste live
let all who wish to

there be silence
uncertainty
yet no one move to go

who will not be slave again
when the beat of you heart
echo the beat of the drum

one violent blow from Valjean send the
soldier fly
the soldier break through at last to the upper room to find
there be only Enjolras still alive
he stand by the window
knowing he will die now proud and unafray
see he the
soldier hesitate
the sudden silence wake Grantaire from
he drunken slumber

long live the republic
he see Enjolras with the musket raised against he
Grantaire go and join he
Enjolras smile and raise his
nowragged red flag
the rifle blaze
Grantaire drop back to the ground
Enjolras fall back
Enjolras falling backwards out of the window until he
hang upside down the red flag still in he hand
streaming like blood down the wall

to see the street litter with corpse and the
remain of the barricade and soldier scour the rubble
for any last pocket of resistance
to come to a stop looking at the wide scene
walk Javert grimly surveying the victory of
law over rebellion
Valjean carry marius down a long narrow alley that run
between the back of tall house
the alley turn a corner
and there ahead be a dead end
behind he the stamp of
soldier boot
ahead no way out
then he search gaze fall on an iron grating in the
ground
storm drain
as they come round the corner into the
end of the alley
they look round
it be empty

nothing here
the soldier depart
moment of silence
then into the alley end step Javert
not so easily
fool
he walk all the way to the end and look round
he see the drain at he foot
he see the sign that the
grating have be lift
he stoop and try to lift it
it be far too heavy for
he
he straighten up and look round calculating
where do
the drain lead
Valjean be pulling marius after he down a tight slope
pipe where dark water race
suddenly they start to slide
then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel
faint
light reflect off the slime of curving tunnel wall
the
skitter of rat
sodden form floating by
dead body
Valjean carry marius down the tunnel moving as fast as
he can losing strength all the time
he reach an
intersection where four sewer meet
light fall through
distant grating
one of the four sewer be dry
here he
let we he burden down and himself sink to the slimy ground
to rest
he let we he eye close
voice echo in the shadow


here a hint of gold
stick into a tooth
pardon i sieur
you will not be need it no more
should not be too hard to sell

well someone get to clean
up i friend
before the little harvest
disappear into the mud
Someones get to collect they
odds and end
when the gutter run with blood

here a tasty ring
pretty little thing
heart no longer going
and he be live he little time
but he watch be ticking yet
it be a world where the dog eat
the dog
where they kill for the bone in
the street
and god in he heaven
he do not interfere
cos he be dead as the stiff at i
foot
i raise i eye to see the
heaven
and only the moon look down
the harvest moon shine down

how do i get out of here

there
that way

as he feel himself sink Valjean hold marius up in his
arm and forge on chest deep lifting the young man
above he head
still he sink until he face be half
submerge and he be gag in the filth
he stumble and
suddenly he be sunk beneath the surface and marius be
dropping
then up he burst again face black with slime eye
burning with he refusal to be beaten
Valjean stagger down the endless sewer marius on
he back
but all the time he can hear closer now the
rush sound of the river
round a bend and at last moonlight ahead
he drag himself on through the shallow run water
towards the moonlight
he reach the exit at last
before he the river
Valjean crust with slime heave marius out of the sewer
onto the embankment that run beside the river
he look up
there stare at he be Javert
Valjean rise slowly
heave marius up onto he back once
more
the strain of the night be showing
he be a man near
the end of he strength

it be you Javert
i know you would not wait too
long
the faithful servant at he post
once more
this mane do no wrong
and he need he family care

i warn you i would not give in

and then i be yours
and all we debt be paid

and talk of justice

look down Javert
he be standing in he grave

one more step and you die

then i die

before i change i mind

who be this man
what sort of devil be he
to have catch i in a trap
and choose to let i go free
it be he hour at last
to put a seal on i fate
wipe out the past
and wash i clean off the slate
all it would take
be a flick of he knife
vengeance be his
and he give i back i life

damned if i live in the debt of a
thief
damned if i yield at the end of
the chase


i be the law and the law be not
mock
i will spit he pity right back in
he face
there be nothing on earth that we
share
it be either Valjean or Javert
how can i allow this man
to hold dominion over i
this desperate man that i have
hunt
he give i i life
he give i
freedom
i should have perished by his
hand
it be he right
it be i right to die as well
instead i live
but live in
hell

and i thought fly apart
can this man be believe
shall he sin be forgive
shall he crime be reprieve
and must i now begin to doubt
who never doubt all those
year
i heart be stone and still it
tremble
the world i have known be lost in
shadow
be he from heaven or from hell
and do he know
that grant i i life today

i be reaching but i fall
and the star be black and cold
as i stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold
i will escape now from that world
from the world of jeans Valjean
this be nowhere i can turn
there be no way to go on

he reach high turning he body twist as if he
want some angel from on high to save he and so
turning he fall into the river
the swirling eddy close
over he
and he be lost
soldier be dismantling the last of the barricade
