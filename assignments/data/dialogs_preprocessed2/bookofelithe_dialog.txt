but we
also know that we be create for
ourselves a world where we could be
safe from the horror of the
forsake land beyond we border

and i want you all to remember
above all that it be not the water
with which we have be blessed
that be the true lifeblood of this
town

you see i be not exploiting these
people i be saving they
any one

helpless blind girl off the road a
girl who be beaten and raped
and give she a place where she can
live without fear
without i you would
be just another noeye lying dead
in the outland picked clean by the

about

it be about love and forgiveness
and life and death and mercy and
revenge and the begin and the
end of the world

about a little bit of everything

can i see

what
i be not going to do anything

i be sorry
i be charged to protect
this book
i can not trust it with
anyone
not even for a while


what be so special about that book

it be the last one
there be no
other book like this
all the
other be go destroyed by the
war or in the burning that come
after
this be the only one that
survive until now
the last one
anywhere

how can you know that

i just know
for a long while after it happen
i just wander on the road like
most everybody else
there be
still a lot of people around back
then in the begin
i do not
really know what i should do or
where i be going
i be just
moving from place to place trying
to stay alive
and then one day i
hear this voice
i do not know how
to explain it it be like it be
coming from inside i
but i could
hear it clear as day
clear as i
can hear you talking to i now

what do it say

it lead i to this place i do not
really know where
and i find this
book bury deep under some rubble
no way noone be ever going to
find it if they do not know exactly
where to look

but you know because the voice told
you

that be right
and that voice told
i to carry the book west


it told i that a path would be
laid out before i that i would be lead
to a place where this book would be
safe
it told i i would be protected
against anyone or anything that
tried to stand in i way
if only i
would have faith
that be twentyfive year ago
and
i have be walking ever since

because a voice you hear in you
head told you to
