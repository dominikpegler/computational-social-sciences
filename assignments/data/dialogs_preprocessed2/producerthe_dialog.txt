you be making i extremely nervous


what be that
handkerchief

if it be nothing why can not i see it

i blanket
give i i blue blanket

here do not panic

i be sorry
i do not like people
touching i blue blanket
it be not
important
it be a minor compulsion
i can deal with it if i want to
it be just that i have have it ever
since i be a baby and
and
i find it very comfort

they come here
they all come here
how do they find i

mr
Bialystock

yes prince mishkin what can we do
for you


this be hardly a time for levity
i have discover a serious error
here in the account of you last
play

where
what

accord to the backer list you
raised
but the show you
produced only cost fiftyeight
thousand
there be two thousand
dollar unaccounted for

i go to a turkish bath who care
the show be a flop
what
difference do it make

it make a great deal of difference
that be fraud
if they find out
you could go to prison

why should they find out
it be
only two thousand dollar bloom
do i a favor move a few decimal
point around
you can do it
you be an accountant
the word
count be part of you title

but that be cheating

it be not cheating
it be charity
bloom look at i
look at i
i be drowning
other man sail
through life
Bialystock have
strike a reef
bloom i be going
under
i be be sunk by a
society that demand success when
all i can offer be failure
bloom
i be reaching out to you
do not
send i to jail
help
help


oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear

help

all right
i will do it
i will do it

thank you bloom
i know i could
con you

oh it be all right
wha

nothing
nothing
do it
do it

now let we see two thousand dollar
that be not much
i be sure i can
hide it somewhere
after all the
department of internal revenue
be not interest in a show that
flop

yes
right
good think
you
figure it out
i be tire
i be
going to take a little nap
wake i if there be a fire

now let we see if we add these
figure we get


heh heh heh amazing
it be
absolutely amazing
but under the
right circumstance a producer
could make more money with a flop
than he could with a hit

yes
yes
it be quite possible
if he be certain the show would
fail a man could make a fortune

yes

yes what

what you be saying
keep talking

what be i saying

you be saying that under the
right circumstance a producer
could make more money with a flop
than he could with a hit

yes it be quite possible

you keep saying that but you do not
tell i how
how could a producer
make more money with a flop than
with a hit


it be simply a matter of creative
account
let we assume just
for the moment that you be a
dishonest man

assume away

well it be very easy
you simply
raise more money than you really
need

what do you mean

you have do it yourself only you
do it on a very small scale

what do i do

you raised two thousand more than
you needed to produce you last play

so what
what do it get i
i be
wearing a cardboard belt

Ahhhhhh
but that be where you make
you error
you do not go all the
way
you see if you be really a
bold criminal you could have
raised a million

but the play only cost to
produce

exactly
and how long do it run

one night


see
you could have raised a
million dollar put on a sixty
thousand dollar flop and keep the
rest

but what if the play be a hit

oh you would go to jail
if the play
be a hit you would have to pay off
the backer and with so many
backer there could never be enough
profit to go around get it

aha aha aha aha aha aha
so
in order for the scheme to work
we would have to find a sure fire flop

what scheme

what scheme
you scheme you
bloody little genius

oh no
no
no
i mean no
scheme
i merely pose a little
academic account theory
it be
just a thought

bloom world be turn on such
thought

do not you see bloom
darling
bloom glorious bloom it be so
simple
step one
we find the
bad play in the world a sure
flop
step two
i raise a million
dollar there be a lot of little
old lady in this world
step
three
you go back to work on the
book
phoney list of backer
one for the government one for we
you can do it bloom you be a
wizard


step four
we open on broadway and
before you can say step five we
close on broadway
step six
we
take we million dollar and fly to
rio de Janiero

ah rio rio by the seao meo
