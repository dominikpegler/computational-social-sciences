you never ever

i tip when somebody
deserve a tip
when somebody
really put forth an effort they
deserve a little something extra
but this tip automatically
that shit for the bird
as far
as i be concern they be just
doin they job


we girl be nice

be here a long fuckin time and
she be only filled i cup three
time
when i order coffee i
want it filled six time


what if she be too busy


the word too busy should not be
in a waitress vocabulary

excuse i mr
white but the last
thing you need be another cup of
coffee


these lady be not starvin to
death
they make minimum wage
when i worked for minimum wage i
be not lucky enough to have a job
that society deem tipworthy

ahh now we be get down to it
it be not just that he be a cheap
bastard


it be that too

it be that too
but it be also
he could not get a waiter job
you
talk like a piss off dishwasher
fuck those cunt and they
fuck tip



so you do not care that they be
counting on you tip to live

it be
the world small violin

occupation for female noncollege
graduate in this country
it be
the one jab basically any woman

i do not want to kill anybody
but
if i get to get out that door and
you be standing in i way one way

choice between doin ten year and
takin out some stupid

either
what the fuck be joe
thinkin
you can not work with a
guy like that
that mother
fucker unstable
what do you

do you think he panicked
or you think he be just trigger
happy


i think he be a sick fuckin maniac
we be awful goddamn lucky he
do not tag we when
he shoot up the place
i come this
fucking close
hold up two finger
and make a tiny
space between they
to taking he ass out myself
everybody panic
when thing get
tense everybody panic
everybody
i do not care what you
name be you can not help it
it be
human nature
but you panic on the
inside
you panic in you head
you give
yourself a couple a second of
panic then you get a grip and
deal with the situation
what you
do not do be shoot up the place
and kill everybody


what you be suppose to do be act
like a fuckin professional

psychopath be not a professional
you can not work with a psychopath
because you do not know what those
sick asshole be going to do next
i mean jesus christ how old do
you think that black girl be
twenty maybe twentyone


do you see what happen to
anybody else


i and mr
orange jump in the
car and mr
brown floor it
after that i do not know what go
down


at that point it become every man
for himself
as far as mr
blonde
or mr
blue be concern i be not
get the foggy
once
i get out i never look back


what do you think


what do i think
i think the cop
caught they or killed they


not even a chance they punched
through
you find a hole


yeah and that be a fuck
miracle
but if they do get
away where the fuck be they


you do not think it be possible one
of they get ahold of the diamond
and pulled a


nope


how can you be so sure


i get the diamond


where


i get they all right


where
be they out in the car


no they be not in the car
no i
do not have they on i
you want to
go with i and get they
yes we
can go right now
but first
listen to what i be telling you
we be fuckin set up
somebody
be in league with the cop
we
get a judas in we midst
and i be
thinkin we should have we fuckin
head examine for waiting around
here


that be the plan we meet here


then where be everybody
i say
the plan become null and void once
we find out we get a rat in the
house
we be not get the slight
fuckin idea what happen to mr
blonde or mr
blue
they could
both be dead
or arrested
they could be
sweatin they down at the station
house right now
yeah they do not
know the name but they can sing
about this place
i mean that could be happening
right now
as we speak the cop
could be in they car drivin
here this minute


i swear to god i be fuckin jinx


what


two job back it be a four man
job we discovered one of the team
be an undercover cop


no shit


thank god we discovered in time
we hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing
just walk away from it


so who be the rat this time
mr
blue
mr
blonde
joe
it be
joes show he set this whole
thing up
maybe he set it up to
set it up


i do not buy it
i and joe go
back a long time
i can tell you
straight up joe definitely do not
have anything to do with this
bullshit


oh you and joe go back a long
time
i known joe since i be a
kid
but i saying joe definitely
could not have do it be
ridiculous
i can say i
definitely do not do it because i
know what i do or do not do
but
i can not definitely say that about
anybody else because i do not
definitely know
for all i know
you be the rat


for all i know you be the rat


now you be use you head
for
all we know he be the rat


jesus christ




be he dead


so be he dead or what


he be not dead


so what be it


i think he be just passed out


he scare the fuckin shit outta
i
i think he be dead fer
sure


he will be dead fer sure if we
do not get he to a hospital


we can not take he to a hospital


without medical attention this
man will not live through the night
that bullet in he belly be i
fault
now while that might not
mean jack shit to you it mean a
helluva lot to i
and i be not
going to just sit around and watch
he die


well first thing first stay
here goofy
we get to book up


so what do you suggest we go to a
hotel
we get a guy who be shoot in
the belly he can not walk he
bleed like a stick pig and when
he be awake he scream in pain


you get to idea spit it out


joe could help he
if we can get
in touch with joe joe could get
he to a doctor joe could get a
doctor to come and see he


assume we can trust joe how we
going to get in touch with he
he be
suppose to be here but he be not
which be making i nervous about
be here
even if joe be
on the up and up he be probably
not going to be that happy with we
joe planned a robbery but he be
get a blood bath on he hand now
dead cop dead robber dead
civilian
jesus christ
i tend
to doubt he be going to have a lot of
sympathy for we plight
if i be
he i would try and put as much
distance between i and this mess
an humanly possible


before you get here mr
orange
be askin i to take he to a
hospital
now i do not like
turning he over to the cop but
if we do not he be dead
he beg
i to do it
i told he to hold
off till joe get here


well joe be not gettin here
we be
on we own
now i do not know a
goddamn body who can help he so
if you know somebody call they


i do not know anybody


well i guess we drop he off at
the hospital
since he do not know

anything to deal with
you do not

right word
you will not want to be you
okay quickly
pointing at the man
as he give they a
name
mr

blonde
mr
blue mr
orange and mr
pink

because you be a faggot


why can not we pick out we own
color

i tried that once it do not work
you get four guy fighting over
who be going to be mr

since
nobody know anybody else nobody
want to back down
so forget it
i pick
be thankful you be not

that be too
close to mr

who care what you name be
who

pink mr
purple mr
pussy mr
piss


oh that be really easy for you to
say you be mr
white
you get to
coolsounding name
so tell i
mr
white if you think mr
pink
be no big deal you want to trade

Nobodys trade with anybody
look this be not a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meet
listen up
mr
pink
we get two way here
i way or the highway
and you
can go down either of they
so
what be it going to be mr
pink


jesus christ joe
fuckin forget
it
this be beneath i
i be mr
pink let we move on

okay fella let we get into this




okay we be going to station man
across the street from Karinas
fine jewelry
but they order
will be not to move in unless the
robbery get out of control
you
get to make sure they do not have to
move in
you be inside to make
sure that everything go
accord to hoyle
we have man
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous
they get
complete visibility of the
exterior
so as soon as joe cabot
show up we will see it

what be you visibility of the
interior

we can not see shit on the inside
and we can not risk gettin any
closer for fear they will spot we

this be bullshit jim
i get all
the fuckin danger of have you
guy in i back pocket but none of
the safety

what be the matter Newendyke
job
too tough for you
no one lie to
you
you always know we would hang
back until joe cabot show up

oh this be great
you be not
giving i no fuckin protection
whatsoever
but you be giving i
an attitude

since when do an undercover cop
have protection
freddy you come
into this thing with you eye
wide open so do not start screamin
blind man now
i understand
you be nervous
i wish the
warehouse have more visible
window but it do not
we have
to make do with the card we be
deal

i do not say i be not going to do it
i be just remark on how shitty
the situation be

i do not mean to be harsh with you
but i have find tough love works
best in these situation
we have
to get joe cabot in the company of
the thief and in the same
vicinity as the loot
we do not care about these other
bastard
we be will to offer
they good deal to testify against
cabot

be not this risk unorthodox

what

letting they go ahead with the
robbery

the whole idea behind this
operation be to catch joe cabot
redhand
we bust these hire
hand we be not accomplish shit
letting they go through with the
heist be a risk but Cabots job
be very clean
we get people
surrounding the perimeter
we get
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
ring
we could replace the
employee with cop but we would run
the risk of tip they off

that be out
they know the face
of who work what shift

these guy be professional
we be professional
it be a risk
but i think it be a calculate
risk




let we go over it
where be you

i stand outside and guard the
door
i do not let anybody come in
or go out


mr
brown

mr
brown stay in the car
he be
park across the street till i
give he the signal then he pull
up in front of the store


mr
blonde and mr
blue

crowd control
they handle
customer and employee in the
display area





myself and mr
pink

you two take the manager in the
back and make he give you the
diamond
we be there for those
stone period
since no display
case be be fucked with no
alarm should go off
we be out
of there in two minute not one
second longer
what if the
manager will not give up the
diamond


when you be dealing with a store
like this they be insured up the
ass
they be not suppose to give
you and resistance
whatsoever
if you get a customer
or an employee who think he be
charles bronson take the butt of
you gun and smash they nose in
drop they right to the floor
everyone jump he fall down
scream blood squirt out he
nose
freak everybody out
nobody say fuckin shit after
that
you might get some bitch
talk shit to you
but give she a
look like you be going to smash she
in the face next
watch she shut
the fuck up
now if it be a
manager that be a different story
the manager know good than to
fuck around
so if one givin
you static he probably think
he be a real cowboy
so what you
get to do be break that sonofa
bitch in two
if you want to know
something and he will not tell you
cut off one of he finger
the
little one
then you tell i be his
thumb next
after that he will
tell you if he wear lady
underwear
i be hungry let we get
a taco





i eye
i eye
i be blind i be
fucking blind

you be not blind there be just
blood in you eye


mr
orange

the bitch get a gun




just hold on buddy boy

i be sorry

case

that

no it be messy as hell but do
you realize how much you get away
with

dollar worth of diamond here


i love this guy

hey what be do be do

all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand
