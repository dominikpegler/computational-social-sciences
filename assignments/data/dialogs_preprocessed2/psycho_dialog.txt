a meaningful quiet
then with difficulty

sam

workingclass tragedy

it be like laughing through a
break jaw but

and besides when you say i make tax
deductible excuse you make i out a
criminal

where be you going
i do not mean to
pry

i be looking for a private island

what be you running away from

why do you ask that

no
people never run away from
anything
the rain do not last very long
you know what i think
i think we be
all in we private trap clamp in
they and none of we can ever climb
out
we scratch and claw
but only
at the air only at each other and
for all of it we never budge an
inch

sometimes we deliberately step into
those trap

i be born in mine
i do not mind it
anymore

you should
mind it

oh i do
but i say i do not

stare at he
shaking she head
softly

if anyone ever speak to i the way
i hear
the way she speak to you
i do not think i could ever laugh
again

sometimes when she talk that way to
i i would like to
curse she out and
leave she forever
or at least defy she
pause a hopeless
shrug
but i could not
she be i will

she sound strong

i mean
i will
she have to raise i all by herself
after i dad die
i be only
five
and it must have be a
strain
oh she do not have to go
out to work or anything dad left we
with a little something
anyway a
few year ago
mother meet a man
he talk she into building this
motel
we could have talk she
into anything
and when
well
it be just too much for she when he
die too
and the way he die
oh it be nothing to talk about when
you be eating
anyway it be too much of a loss
for i mother
she have nothing
left

except you

son be a poor substitute for a
lover
turn away as if in
distaste of the word

why do not you go away

to a private island like you

no not like i

it be too late for i
and besides
who look after she
she would be alone
up there the fire would go out
damp and cold like a grave
when
you love someone you do not do that
to they even if you hate they
oh
i do not hate she
i hate
what
she be become
i hate
the illness

would not it be good if you put she
in
someplace

an institution
madhouse
people
always call a madhouse someplace

put she in someplace

i be sorry
i do not mean it to
sound uncaring

to tight fury

do you know how i find out about
you

all shiny and proper
she always
tried to be proper

watch you tense

huh

she always try to be proper

decide what we be going to say and
do when we walk in

we be going to register
as man and
wife
and get show to a cabin
and then search every inch of that
place inside and
outside

you will not believe it
but this will be the first time
i have ever pull one of those man
andwiferentingcabin caper

tiny smile first
in hour
i believe it



unconsciously
whispering
i wonder where norman bates do he
hermiting

someone be at that window
i see
the curtain move

come on

just coming up to ring for you

i suppose you want a cabin

we would hope to make it straight to
san francisco but we do not like the
look of that sky
look like a bad
day come
do not it

i will take you to

good sign in first have not we

it be not necessary

interrupt with a
friendly cheerfulness
uh uh
i boss be paying for this
trip
ninety percent business
and he want practically notarized
receipt
i well sign in and get a
receipt

i will get you bag

have not any

i will show you the cabin

first time i have see it happen
check in any place in this country
without bag and you have to pay in
advance

ten dollar

that receipt

i will start ahead

to norman who be
follow
do not bother yourself
we will find
it

we should have ask for cabin one
the one mary be in

i be glad we do not

we have to go into that cabin and
search it sam
no matter what
we be afraid of finding and no matter
how much it may hurt

i know
do you think if something happen
it happen there

pause then

sam if you owned a useless business
like this motel
one you probably
could not even sell
what would
you need to get away to start a new
business somewhere else
forty thousand dollar

how could we prove
an almost hopeless
laugh
well if he open a new motel on the
new highway
say a year from now

there must be some proof that exist
right now
something that prove he
get that money away from mary
some way

what make you sound so certain

Arbogast
sam he liked i
or
feel sorry for i
and he be
starting to feel the same about you
i hear it when he called
in he
voice a caring
he would not have
go anywhere or do anything without
telling we
unless he be stopped
and he be stopped so he must have
find out something

we will start with cabin one

if he see we
we be just taking
the air

bates

sorry

hospital clean

what

the bathroom
look at how clean it
be
the one in we cabin be clean
but this be clean

what be it

it do not get washed down
it be
figure
the kind you tear up and
get rid of
extend she finger
toward sam
some figure have be added to or
subtract from
forty thousand

that be proof mary be here
it would
be too wild a coincidence for somebody
else to

bates never deny mary be here

yes
but maybe this prove that bates
find out about the money

do we simply ask he where he be hide
it

sam that old woman whoever she be
i think she told Arbogast something
and i want she to tell we the same
thing

you can not go up there

why not

bates



let we find he
one of we can keep
he occupied while the other get to
the woman



you will not be able to hold he still
if he do not want to be hold
and i
do not like you going into that house
alone lila



i can handle a sick old woman



all right
i will find bates and keep
he occupied

wait a minute
if you get anything
out of the mother
can you find you way back to town
if you do get anything do not stop
to tell i

look for i

yes matter of fact
the wife taking a nap and
i can
never keep quiet enough for she
so i think i would look you up and
talk

satisfied with you cabin

fine

cheerfully as if
after a selfconscious
pause
i have be do all the talk so
far have not i

yes

i always think it be the people
who be alone so much who do all the
talking when they get the chance
yet there you be do all the
listening
you be alone here be not you
as norman do not
reply
it would drive i crazy

that would be a rather extreme
reaction would not it

just an expression
what i mean be
i would do just about
anything
to get away
would not
you



mrs
bates

i be not saying you should not be
content here i be just doubting
that you be
i think if you see a
chance to get out from under
you would unload this place

this place
this be not a place

it be i only world
i grow up in
that house back there
i be a happy
child
i mother and i
we be
more than happy

and now that you mother dead

i mother be not dead

i do not think so

you look frighten
have i be
saying something frighten

i do not know what you have be saying

i have be talking about you mother
about you motel
how be you going
to do it

do what

buy a new one
in a new town
where you will not have to hide you
mother

shut up

where will you get the money to do
that bates
or do you already
have it
sock away
a lot of
it

leave i alone

forty thousand dollar

leave i alone

i bet you mother know where the
money be
and what you do to get
it
and i think she will tell we

where be that girl
the girl you come
with
where be she

oh god

mrs
bates



Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee am norma
bates


indicate the front
door he have just
come in through
you think they will take he out that
way

look at waiting
crowd shrug
probably have to
besides the taxpayer hate it when
something get slipped out the back
door on they


it be regular
okay

i could stand something regular

you two can go on home if you like
a sympathetic look
at lila
making that statement be enough for
one night

want to

no
i be all right
i will feel good
when all this be explain
if it
can be

if anybody get any answer it will
be the fellow talking to he now
the psychiatrist
even i could not
reach norman
and he know i
you warm enough miss

do he talk to you

no
i get the whole story
but not
from norman
i get it from
he
mother

norman bates no longer exist
he
only halfexisted to begin with
now the other half have taken over
probably for all time

do he kill i sister

yes
and no

look if you be trying to lay a lot
of psychiatric groundwork for some
sort of plea this fellow would like
to cop

psychiatrist do not lay the
groundwork
he merely try to
explain it

but i sister be

yes
i be sorry
the private investigator too
if
you drag that swamp somewhere in the
vicinity of the motel
have you any unsolved miss person
case on you book

yes
two

young girl

nod astounded
then

do he confess to

as i said the mother
to understand it as i understood it
hearing it from the mother
that
be from the motherhalf of normans
mind you have to go back ten year
to the time when norman murdered he
mother and she lover
pause then as no
one interrupt
he be already dangerously disturbed
have be ever since he father die
he mother be a cling demanding
woman
and for year the two of
they live as if there be no one
else in the world
then she meet a
man and it seem to norman she threw
he over for this man
that push
he over the thin line
and he
killed they both
matricide be
probably the most unbearable crime
of all
and most unbearable to the
son who commit it
so he have to erase
the crime at least in he own mind
he steal she corpse
and a weight
coffin be buried
he hide the body
in the fruit cellar even treated
it to keep it as well as it would
keep
and that still be not enough
she be there but she be a corpse
so he begin to think and speak for
she give she half he life so to
speak
at time he could be both
personality carry on
conversation
at other time the
motherhalf take over completely
he
be never all norman but he be
often only mother
and because he
be so pathologically jealous of
she he assumed she be as jealous
of he
therefore if he feel a strong
attraction to any other woman the
mother side of he would go wild
when norman meet you sister he be
touched by she
and aroused by
she
he wanted she
and this set off
he jealous mother and
mother
killed the girl
after the murder
norman return as if from a deep
sleep
and like a dutiful son
covered up all trace of the crime
he be convince he mother have
committed

why be he
dressed like that

he be a transvestite

not exactly
man who dress in
woman clthe in order to achieve
a sexual change
or satisfaction
be a transvestite
but in normans
case he be simply do everything
possible to keep alive the illusion
of he mother be alive
and
whenever reality come too close
when danger or desire threatened
that illusion he would dress up even
to a cheap wig he bring and he would
walk about the house sit in she
chair speak in she voice
he tried
to be he mother
and now he be
that be what i mean when i said i
get the story from the mother
she
think norman have be taken away
because of he crime
she insist
she do nothing that norman committed
all the murder just to keep she
from be discover
she even smile
a bit coquettishly as she said that
of course she feel badly about
it
but also somewhat relieve to
be as she put it free of norman
at last
when the mind house two
personality there be always a
battle
in normans case the battle
be over
and the dominant
personality have win

and the forty thousand dollar
who
get that

the swamp
these be murder of
passion not profit

he feel a little chill
can i
bring he this blanket





it be sad
when a mother have to
speak the word that condemn she own
son
but i could not allow they to
believe that i would commit murder
they will put he away now
as i
should have
year ago
he be
always
bad
and in the end he
intended to tell they i killed those
girl
and that man
as if i could
do anything except just sit and
stare
like one of he stuff
bird
well they know i can not even move a
finger
and i will not
i will just sit
here and be quiet
just in case they
do
suspect i



they be probably watch i
well
let they
let they see what kind of
a person i be
pause as the fly
light on normans
hand
i be not going to swat that fly
i
hope they be watch
they will see
they will see
and they will know
and they will say
why she would not
even harm a fly
