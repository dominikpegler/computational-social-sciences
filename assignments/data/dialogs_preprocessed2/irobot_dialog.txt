hillary seitz


of
off to the side
just barely
noticeable


as we realise
it be

something
then

muted
we can not quite make out
what it be saying
as it get
and
when we
finally
understand

you be in danger


he eye snap open
he face
covered in sweat
to he lying in bed
sheet tangled around
he leg
alarm clock playing something relentlessly
cheerful
spooner slap it off
sit up
wince
bend he

stiff
he reach for a
shake out a
couple and swallow they
trying to forget
that dream
you be in danger
he rub he hand over he face
get out of bed
he
apartment basic
unremarkable
bear the sign of
someone who life alone
shade draw
little messy
spooner turn he face into the jet of water
shave with a razor
use he leave hand
knick the cleft
of he chin
shit
stare down at the single egg in a saucepan
wait for it
to boil

head down the hallway
loop a knot tie around his
neck
kick some neglected mail from the door and reach
for the handle
take a deep breath and
step outside
into the flow of heading for the
elevate train
elbow to elbow
river of humanity
spooner move along like everyone else
suddenly
he
shoulder tense
that feel at the back of he neck
he
turn and see

just behind he
humanoid in design but still
obviously a machine
metal and synthetic casing covering
hydraulic muscle
the thing sense he stare
look up
with a mute

good day sir
spooner
speed up he pace
weaving through the crowd to
lose the robot
we now realise this be
tower apartment
building block the sun
the street packed with traffic
wearing they computer like formfitting
portable office
spooner throw a look at he surroundings
up high an roll down the side of a build
clean window
of oddlyshaped efficiently
repair the street
no human supervision

lumbering along the sidewalk
scrub sweep
empty trash
humanoid dotting the crowd
following they owner
walk slowly deliberately
carry box
grocery
briefcase
stamp on all the a

spooner stop to wait at a light with other
directly in front of he a clutch she father
neck
she smile big at spooner
front tooth missing

hi


hi
but it be not she father
it be she
the
robot turn
look at the girl

you be not allow to talk to
stranger
spooner disgust
have have enough
he step off the curb
just as
swivel around
training it large
digital on he

please return to the sidewalk
spooner dodge several car on he way across the street

please return to the sidewalk
the traffic signal tracking he

you be in violation of city
ordinance
spooner throw up he hand
flip it the bird just as

it take he picture

spooner step onto a sleek densely pack
look
down at he foot
trampled flyer on the ground
from the
AntiRobot league

robot get up
to offer he he seat
spooner
turn his
back on he as we from the window to
the hurtling toward
soaring gravitydefying
dominate the skyline
old building
wedged among the new
all protected by huge glass and steel
shield
as we get closer congested road and freeway begin to
disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnel
the old street have become huge spacious plaza

spooner move with the towards the door of the age
police headquarters
modern addition have be make to the
original facade create an ungainly architectural mess
vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
of glassenclosed room
on the other side a
with real time video of various street and building
spooner arrive at he desk
unlike the other it be a mess
slender computer screen curve along the front of it
several electronic message say the same thing





ever hear the phrase lead by
example

spooner look up
stand in front of
he desk holding up a with a photo of spooner
giving that traffic signal the finger

do not ring a bell


pointing to spooners
badge
it be on you badge
spooner take the citation
drop it into a drawer filled
with about fifty other


the traffic division file an
official complaint this morning

the traffic division be a machine


look i know there be going to be an
adjustment period del

i will send they a letter of apology
maybe some flower
box of
chocolate

spooners phone
he throw bergin a look
then snatch up the receiver

spooner homicide

sprawl glass and metal complex covering many city
block
the entrance be a large plaza filled with and

an elevator open with a whoosh
spooner step out into a
featureless corridor
he footstep echoing
he stop at a
set of
look over at one when the other
suddenly
warm mahoganypaneled room
in sharp contrast to the cold
metal space outside
spooner step inside
at the end of a
long conference table sit an
sparkle blue eye
oldfashion suit

hello there
please come in
spooner hesitate

it be alright
you can sit
sit
spooner do not
look around the room
the old man lift
up a coffee pot
pour some coffee into a single cup

coffee

you be offering i a cup of coffee

yes
but you be to say no
thank you

spooner nod a little
the old man raise the coffee to his
lip but do not take a sip


coffee

no
thank you

as you wish

you want to tell i something about
dr
Hogenmiller
about he death

i want to tell you that he death
be not a suicide

and why do you say that

why
because i want you to know
it

i understand that
but what
specifically lead you to believe
that he do not commit suicide

nothing specifically

under normal circumstance that
would not be enough to get you a
homicide investigation

but this be not normal
circumstance be it detective
spooner

no
it be not


then you will find out who killed
dr
Hogenmiller yes
and then you
will tell i
spooners losing he patience

if you be murdered doctor i will
find out
and you will be the first
to know
the of
vanish in a burst
of as do the table the coffee pot and the
conference room
spooner suddenly find himself standing in
front of a inside a
spooner step out into the hallway and into



please follow i
spooner
reluctantly start to follow it
pass another
doorway
stretched across it
catch a brief
glimpse of


splay out across the floor
surround by

he pause
take in the scene
then
continue on
two large door emblazon with the you

open
automatically
inside an enormous glassenclosed boardroom
looking out over the entire complex
spooner walk through the doorway
he escort robot trail
behind he
an army of corporate type sit around a
conference table
young
energetic
you can practically
feel the brain and ambition

usually i ask who be in charge
spooners eye lock with a sitting at the head of the
table
s handsome charismatic
dr

founder and of you

robotics


but everyone know you dr
robertson

remind i to cut back on i talk
show appearance

welcome to you

robotics
detective
i regret you be not
visiting we under more pleasant
circumstance
allow i to
introduce mr
aronson we head of
legal affair

and the gentleman to i right be
dr
alfred lanning director of
research

they will be available to answer any
question you might have during
you investigation
you will
understand how anxious we be to
resolve this matter especially
before the press get wind of it
there be some antirobot
sentiment out there as you know
detective and we be not eager to
stir they up
so
where would you
like to begin

we can begin with whether or not
the old man put a gun to he head
and pulled the trigger

you do not have to answer that dr
robertson


susan
perhaps you can assist we
here

dr
Hogenmiller be a schizoid
personality who generally eschew
social relationship
reject
people in favor of solitary
activity involve machine
he
spent almost all he time at the
lab here or at he lab at home
as
a result he be highly susceptible
to depression

dr
calvin be we chief
psychologist

if that be you diagnosis why
do not you see this come

this be you

robotics detective
Seventyfive percent of we
employee fit that description

you will have to excuse the doctor
we be all a little on edge
this
have be a difficult and emotional
morning

yeah
i can see you be all broken
up


dr
Hogenmiller be at i side from
the very beginning of this
company
we developed the three
law of robotic together
but
these day science be a young mane
game
by the time you hit thirty
you good year be behind you
some of we be kick upstairs
other i be afraid be not so lucky
robertson stand
meeting over

dr
Hogenmiller take he own life
i trust you will come to the same
swift conclusion detective
dr
lanning will make himself available
if you have any far question
spooner look over at calvin

i want she to help i
calvin unhappy with this arrangement

that be not really i department

susan would be happy to assist you
and with a gesture robertson dismiss everyone
people
start get up gathering up filing out
susan calvin
the last one to get up
spooner and calvin heading down the same hallway he be in
before
catch sight of a couple

ah christ
toaster
as they duck under the police tape and

enter Hogenmillers lab
alive with activity



running across

black gun powder
fan out
around he contort lip
spooner
throw a look around the lab

everywhere
mostly incomplete



dangle from the
ceiling

pass they by

they say the price going to come
down a lot next year
kinda cool
huh

how cool will it be when one take
you job
spooner
push past he
he eye
dart around

be everything alright detective

yeah
this be just how i like i
robot in piece
as they approach Hogenmillers body the lead
get up to meet they

can you believe it man
you

robotics
i do not think i would ever
see the inside of this build
hand spooner a plasma clipboard
spooner sign it
awkwardly
with he

what be the rundown

heinrich Hogenmiller sixtyfour
year old
weapon a small caliber
registered in he name
look
like he walk in locked the door
and snuff himself


i know someone who disagree with
you

who

he

i speak to a dead man today
want
to tell i about that

dr
Hogenmillers hologram take his
appointment
attend staff
meeting
he hated corporate life
the hologram enable he to focus
on he work
it be just a device
detective

device that called the police

the sound of the gunshot would have
trigger a

but the call come directly to i

we be talking about a mechanism
design by Hogenmiller to say
provocative thing
to irritate
and confound he colleague

and that be what you think it be

i be sorry but this whole
investigation be the result of a
dead mane toy mess with you
head


when be the last time any of you
actually speak to Hogenmiller
i
mean human to human

i could not say

take a guess

i do not guess detective
but if
press i would reason it have be
a considerable length of time

how well do you know he

not well
but i admire he work
tremendously

i get the whole mad scientist
thing
Hogenmiller be past his
prime
isolated
eccentric
he
enter a room
lock the door and
be find minute later with a
bullet fired through he mouth into
he brain
everything about this
case say suicide

you do not sound convince

even people who live a life of
logic and precision rarely arrange
they death so perfectly


what all this be miss be
personality
as he start for the door

you have hour surveillance
they head out into the hallway

rolling into place behind they

it be company policy

i want to see the tape
calvin
hurry to keep up with he
this be hardly how
she wanted to spend she morning
call out into the air

victor
at the end of the corridor near the elevator a
appear
hover just in front of the wall
two
small slit grow into
and a thin mouth
expand into an

detective meet victor
we
build supercomputer
he be the
check and balance of you


victor detective spooners head
up the investigation into the death
of dr
Hogenmiller
victor smile big
spooner furrow he brow

you look like a very
happy
computer
victor respond in a

thank you
that be very kind

the detective need to see we
security tape

the elevator door immediately
they step inside
spooner and calvin descend
victor float on the wall and
smile wide
spooner look back at it
with a frown
the elevator stop the door open
step on

good day dr
calvin
good day
sir
spooners jaw
clench
stare at the robot
it sense
the stare
turn back to he

may i be of service to you sir
spooner
break the stare
ignore the robot
calvin
look over at he

be not you going to answer he

i do not talk to i refrigerator
either
calvin fold she arm

i get the distinct feel you be
one of those people detective

what people

those who do not appreciate the work
we do here at you



you people do what you do
then
it be up to the rest of we to make
sense out of the world we wake up
in
as the elevator door open on to

soar lobby
the centerpiece be a fivestory of a
arm outstretched in approximation of da Vincis study
of man
robot worker more numerous than human
they be
sleek
fine
more advance than those in the outside
world
calvin and spooner head across

when this company start we be
manufacture three robot a week
now look at we
today child
will never know a world without
robot

the street be filled with
unemployed human who be not
exactly thril with that idea

we robotic system maintain
factory inventory regulate
street traffic even run the
family home

leaving people to do what doctor

leaving people to engage in high
pursuit that make life worth
live

and what happen when something
go wrong

we system never wrong
as they walk through the crowd we hear the quiet of
robot head as they turn in succession to watch spooner pass
spooner and calvin enter the of you

robotics
this be the nerve center of the whole operation
wall lined
with and thousands of


this be victor home

i will now play you the last thirty
two second of dr
Hogenmillers
life

where be the tape from inside

dr
Hogenmiller do not permit
camera to observe he while
work

that be only within the last year

so we can throw paranoia into the
mix
Fastforward

um
i hate to be a stickler

but do not killer usually have to
enter and exit the scene of a
crime


stop the recording
spooner turn away from the footage
stare at calvin

they do doctor
unless they have
always be there and never
left
calvin look at he
trying to understand

you think the murderer be in the
lab the entire time

if i be right it be still there
spooner turn back to the screen
the pause at the
exact moment the rolled in front of the lab
door

we just locked it in
the of the retract with a
the
laboratory door slide open
spooner and calvin step inside
it be dark
quiet
police
and technician long go
silhouette of hanging limb
eyeless head
clump of wire and metal
the flicker on
calvin see spooner reaching into
he coat with he leave hand
pull out a
react

robot cannot harm a human being
detective
the first law of
robotics forbid it
and we hard
wire the three law into every
model
without exception

yeah i see the commercial
spooner step deeper into the lab
eye scanning
twisting
to avoid touching any robot part
pass a holding a


the bug to life


and if a robot be given a direct
order to kill

the second law of robotic would
prevent it
robot must obey an
order only if it do not conflict
with the first law

but a robot can defend itself

only when that action do not
conflict with the first or second
law
this be the third law of
robotics

yeah well you know what they say
law be make to be broken

not these law

you be not hearing i detective
there be nothing here

dr
calvin


goddammit
stay back

calm down detective
there be no
danger here

deactivate

how do you know it be under
there

if i be metal and do not want
anyone to find i i would hide under a
pile of junk

this robot be not hide
what
you be looking at be the result of
clever program
the illusion
of selfinterest and free will
nothing more

i be going to go get dr
lanning

i said deactivate


move away from the door doctor

commence emergency shutdown

now

i
i give you an order

this be impossible
robot

can not do that
yeah yeah i
know

i god do you see how it moved
i have never see an move that
way

wait
please you can not destroy
it
we have to study it

that thing take i gun
you will be
lucky if you get a handful of bolt
back

sprint out into the hallway
the robot suspect
about
to turn to corner

suddenly appear

the suspect be near the end of
the hallway detective

gee thank
spooner raise he gun and
peg the robot in the

it start jerking wildly
he take aim again when

race out into the hallway

get back to the lab
she head for the robot

you be malfunction
let i help
you
the robot turn
to look at she
pointing to the floor
spooner
in on he

and he for calvin
force she to the floor as the
robot
again and again
bullet
around
they
against the wall
the open
the robot leap inside
spooner
on top of calvin
look down at she
she
clutch he coat
tremble

that be a pretty convince
illusion of get shot at

the standing inside the elevator
look down
at the bullet hole blown through it leg
reach down
metal finger touching the damage
as if curious
afraid

look back at the other
standing in the back of
elevator
primitive model
no reaction
face blank

spooner spring to he foot
helping calvin up

i take the liberty of alert
security
second after the
first shot be fired

where be that elevator going

sub level
spooner against a nearby
hurtle down the

of
crossing the lobby

more
pour into a
spooner and calvin
race down the stairs
victor face
meeting they at every land

i have directed a security team to
meet the elevator contain the
errant robot
spooner
whip past he
calvin
barely keeping up
not used to this much activity
spooner
through a door and out into
subterranean level
labyrinth of metal and concrete

troupe of swarm
around a close


the suspect be about to be
apprehend detective

i will believe it when i see it

wait

this be not the same robot

what happen to the robot that
ordered you to hold this firearm

this unit be not programme to obey
an order given by a robot

but who give you this gun

metal man


he out into the in front of you

robotics
squint into the light
then into the crowd




they all look the same from
behind
spooner run
through the sea of and

when someone
start to
at the sight of
he
the crowd begin
chaos
spooner
stop
near a fountain
turning
look everywhere
the robot
go



i want a homicide unit on every
street sidewalk alley
spooner standing in front of an assemblage of
behind
he an image of the robot suspect play on the screen

junkyard scrapyard and salvage
yard anywhere it could hide
behind he flashing image of the city and

it be get a bullet hole above the
right knee so be on the lookout
for any malfunction
lieutenant bergin enter the back of the room
next to he



not looking happy

check out all retail outlet and
repair shop especially the
underground one
the screen behind he compartmentalise showing various
dubious

i do not care who you have to get
past to get this do
just get it
do
the cop begin dispersing
as bergin catch spooners eye
spooner not please to see toller
head over


look like shit spooner

well i be not the one always giving
press conference


del we be going to have to
reclassify the search


s
office be seeing this as
miss evidence not a
homicide suspect

what

homicide be the murder of a human
be by another human being
therefore a robot cannot be
charged with homicide


this be not just any robot

it be malfunction

it killed someone
that
register with you

how many share of you


you
holding in you portfolio toller

this be a public safety issue

that be convenient

you have any idea what would happen
to this city if we go running
around screaming killer robot

it would collapse in on itself


widespread panic
until that
s find we be cooperate with
you

robotic and keeping this
investigation under wrap


maybe this be not the case for you
del
incense spooner reply a little loud than he intended

i be fine
rake he hand through he hair
turn to see the other
looking over at he
toller smirk
look to bergin

i want update report every half
hour
head off
spooner
watch he

this be it you know
from now on
we be going to miss the good old
day


good old day

when people be killed by other
people
spooner
rolling along in he car
eye bloodshot
peer out the window
an model laden with shop bag following it
owner down the sidewalk
another opening the door at a hotel for
couple loading heavy box onto the back of
a truck
spooner
rub he eye
turn a corner and spot


the late model in the window
shiny
streamlined
spooner watch as a lead she faulty to the
service entrance
he stop the car
calvin riding in the back of a taxi cab
stare
out the window lost in thought
the cab pull up to a curb

we have arrive at you
destination
calvin
take a beat
then swipe she card
elegant condo set on prime real estate
calvin head down a
treelined walk towards she condo entrance



one of i bullet hit you robot
startled
she drop she key card
as spooner step out from
behind a tree
the tail of he coat whipping in the wind

detective

and i think it be smart enough to
repair itself do not you

yes
i think so

where

any repair shop

no
it be always the owner who
bring the robot in for repair
where would a robot without an
owner go


i be not sure what you be get
at

do you

robotic have a factory
in the city limit

the location of we factory be
classified

i do not care

i have several condition if i show
you

i expect that

first
i want it bring in
unharmed

agreed

second
i want to talk to it
alone

too dangerous

this model violate the three law
it also moved and react
differently than any robot i have
ever see
there must be some sort
of logical explanation
i want to
find out what that be
no police
no prosecutor
no you
just i
and the robot


when they told i you be a
psychologist that be not the whole
truth be it

i never said i treated human
being
spooners car race down a and the roadway become a
lane underground tunnel system
river of
stretch forever in either direction
lock onto the car guiding it to a merge with

spooner hit the and switch to
manual
calvin watch he take the wheel
shake she head

that should be outlaw once and
for all

Thatll be the day i stop driving
spooner jam the and the tunnel become a
calvin hold onto the dashboard
look a little pale

i can recommend a behavior
modification program you know
if you want to overcome you robo
phobia

i be not afraid of robot
i just
do not like they

why
because they make every
aspect of we live more
convenient

exactly
they do we dirty work
ever do hard labor doctor
get
pretty old pretty fast
nobody
can do someone else dirty work
without coming to hate they
i
do not want to be around when you
robot decide they have taken they
last order


that day will never come
detective
robot be not like
human being they do not question
they existence
spooner crank the gear shift
throw she a look

spoken like a true robophile
the car come to a stop in a vast
spooner and calvin get out looking up at the impose facade
of a you

robotics assembly plant
long too
high to see over protect the unmarked complex
calvin look anxious as the scan she you



she shoot a look at spooner
they wait
then slowly
the gate begin to open
lead they down a hallway
shake he head

HeadOffice already ordered a
systemwide inventory check
do not
know about a miss
look back at spooner

Whatd you say you do

research and development
as spooner push past he into
the control booth
overlook the pristine factory
floor
the foreman start working the control of a central
computer

all Nestors account for

the scroll with

as you can see all properly
catalogue
you robot just be not
here
calvin turn to say something to spooner
but he be not
there
she look around
then see the foreman react
look out the window at

walk out onto the factory floor
spooner trot alongside an
lined with

new
gleaming
heading towards the assembly room
calvin and the foreman
catching up
over the noise

like i said sir we have one
hundred fully assembled s
house here
that be we capacity
last week we have one hundred
yesterday we have one hundred
spooner slow
finally spot what he be looking for
point at

on the assembly belt


well today you have onehundred and
one
open and s march out in tight
formation
every step and swing of the arm in unison
the
sound of reverberate through the plant as
robot organise themselves into long straight line
spooner and calvin look up and down the formation
they all
look alike
spooner
throw up he hand

you be the robot shrink
the robot stand motionless
strange tableau
calvin
take a step forward


there be a robot in this formation
that do not belong
identify it



which one



that be not a satisfactory answer



that be helpful

i could always interview each one
individually and crossreference
they response to detect any
anomaly

how long would that take

about three week

or

we have one hundred robot here
that cannot allow a human being to
come to harm


and one that can

be i holding this right

more or less

enough gameplaying

guess that be not it

what be you do

this be a selfpreservation field
test
attempt to save
yourselves
any of you
that be an
order


be you crazy
those be eight
hundred thousand dollar machine
spooner randomly stop at another robot
raise he gun

you hear that
you be worth more
than i will make in i entire life
he finger tightening on the trigger when calvin suddenly
grab he arm

you can not just destroy they
spooner
look down at she
something
catch he eye

down the line
almost
imperceptible
he jerk he head
lock eye with a
couple foot
away
it be he

Gotcha
the robot suspect forward
grab onto the
of an
he movement almost balletic as he
swing himself up
spooner drop to he knee
taking aim
but miss as the
robot launch himself with
a terrific
spooner and calvin rush in to find the night foreman hide
under he desk
glass everywhere
an
the
door on the other side barely hanging off a hinge
spooner hurry forward
then stop
turning to calvin
reach down for he backup gun and press it into she
hand

you do not know what be going to
happen in there
as if admitting defeat
Calvins finger wrapping around
the gun
as spooner lead they to the door and down into

the
every surface looking like part of a
great glass and metal machine
endless hightech plane
holding in various state of assembly
the deafen
of the assembly line as it slide rotate and gnash

spooner
motion calvin to stay behind he
as they
descend
into the cavernous room
and enter
narrow corridor of body
sliding past they
brush shoulder thigh hand
spooner
wipe sweat
from he brow
trying
to pivot himself
when the room
suddenly itself
another of

descend between spooner and calvin
cutting they
off from one another
spooner
catching glimpse of calvin
on the other side of
the metal body
trying
to cut through
he heart
starting to
as calvin
disappear
he swivel round
but another line of
drop down
cutting he off
he stumble back
as another line
appear before he
breathe
get heavy
he look down at he hand
it be trembling
all around he
everywhere
he turn
more


he dart through the line
find a wall
lean against
it pull a small from he pocket
rip off the lid
shake out a couple
swallow they
stare down
at
he trembling hand
squeezing he eye
open and shut

pass
grab he by the collar
he against the wall
it be the suspect
spooner
sink to the ground
as the suspect robot
slip off the
line

over he
raising he arm
could end it
right now
but look
into spooners eye
then turn
disappear
spooner
stun for a second
then
rally
scramble
to he foot and plunge back into the maze of body
hear
a
in the distance
catch a glimpse
of the
robot
trying to through a large
with
he metal fist
spooners view
block once again
by a shift row
when a
land on he shoulder
he wheel round

to find
take she by the arm
and force they
through a line
into the open
the
still pounding
desperate
like a trap animal

now what do we do

i have already do it
and suddenly the massive
the robot suspect take it chance
run full out

bergin be standing in front of a solid wall of
be aim at the
robot
reflect off it metal surface
the robot turn to spooner
extend it hand
palm out

i
spooner be surprise
fire
shooting out at sonny
fire and a
second net cover he
then a
and the robot fall to the ground struggling
calvin glare at spooner
furious
hurt
betrayed

we have a deal
but spooner do not look at she
he eye be locked on that
robot
bergin enter
find focused on the

be speaking over image of street
violence perpetrate against

violence erupt last night in
response to unconfirmed report
that dr
heinrich Hogenmiller a
top employee at you



robotic be killed yesterday
morning by a robot
while there
have be no official response from
the company police source have
confirmed that a robot be be
hold as evidence

bergin grimace
this be not good
spooner stare at he reflection in a large
touch
a control and the mirror become a onto

the robot suspect sit at the table
shackle to the chair
stare at the table top
step up beside spooner
look through the glass


i can not tell if it be not moving
because it be trying to psych we
out or because it be just a
machine
or both

i want to go in


order be nobody step into that
room til lanning and he attorney
get here
spooner
throw he a look
bergin he loyalty torn


five minute
spooner enter
pull out a chair and drag it far from the
table
he be be jump too many time by this machine
four mount camera to life
the robot
perfectly
still

identify
the robot tilt it head with a mute
as if it do not
understand he
spooner
disdainful


you be an Nestorclass robot
you primary function be to perform
the task assign to you
identify

i be an Nestorclass robot
i primary function

cancel
perform task

describe

you have over word stored
in you memory
one third of those
be adjective
describe

why do not i take a crack
heinrich
Hogenmiller you creator
with a
bullet in he brain
bullet you
put there

Coldblooded murder be a pretty new
trick for a robot do not you think
answer

maybe you be stonewal i
maybe you be sitting there right
now think this guy a
complete asshole
that it


come on
be i right

yes
you be right
you be a
complete asshole

okay
i guess that be a start
now
maybe you can tell i what you be
do hide five foot away from
Hogenmillers corpse

i be frighten

frighten
why do you suppose dr
Hogenmiller would create a robot
that could simulate fear

i do not know

do not seem like a very useful
thing for a robot to have

i do not know why

i would not want i toaster to be
frighten
or i vacuum cleaner

i do not

look like you can simulate other
emotional state
i think that
one called anger
have you
ever simulate anger before


answer i robot

i name be sonny

so we be name you now

dr
Hogenmiller would make i
sleep

you mean he would turn you off

yes

and you do not like be turn
off
so one day you decided to
stop he

no

you find he gun pointed it at
he head
and pulled the trigger

no

you put a bullet in the brain of
the man who make you

no
i could never hurt anyone

but you tried to hurt i
you take
a shot at i

i aim be perfect
if i would wanted
to hit you i would have

spooners expression harden

why would the man who write the
law of robotic build a machine
that violate they

the law say i can protect i own
existence

only if that protection do not
harm a human being
short pause
sonny
tilt he head

that do not seem fair do it
spooner
stare at he
just as

bergin enter
stick he head in


i need you outside
spooner
not wanting to go
not wanting to stay
get
up

detective
he stop
turn back to the robot
it look up at he
for
a moment so human

i do not kill he

you be the only one in the room
if you do not who do
he turn and head out the door
bergin close the door
to spooner


we be be blindsided

spooner and bergin head into a small off the main
squad room
lanning be huddle with aronson and a halfdozen
other
spooners jaw tense
as he watch toller emerge from the
clutch
shake hand
slap back
stroll over to
they

we get judge drexel

this hear be called to order

on behind they
the two oppose
side assemble before it
still in his
pajamas and robe
an
lean in to serve he a
cup of tea

statement gentleman
aronson
standing at a glass podium

you honor the state be treat
the robot as a defendant
but in
fact it be a piece of property
property belonging to you

robotics
toller
arm resting on he podium

this robot have be implicated in
the death of a human be you
honor

which place the incident firmly
within the realm of an industrial
accident
or be the state going to
argue this case s a homicide

that be a good question

no sir
of course not
spooner
point a finger at the you

robotics group


they machine shoot and killed a
man

there be actually no concrete
evidence that point to that
conclusion you honor

what

but we recognise that this robot be
an aberration
and in the interest
of public safety you

robotics
propose that it be destroyed
immediately

you can not let they destroy evidence
in an ongoing investigation

i be not sure you even have an
investigation any more

you honor i would like to call we
company robopsychologist to the
stand

very well

i do


dr
calvin please tell we what
conclusion you have reach after
have observed the robot in
action

there be a design flaw in the
robot
it program be
advance but unstable leaving the
three law in a grave imbalance

in you expert opinion what
measure should be taken regarding
the device
calvin
stare straight ahead
avoid spooners eye

the robot must be destroyed
spooner can not believe what he be just hear
about to speak
up when toller grab he arm
squeezing it
hard
judge drexel have hear enough
decide

the robot in question will be
transferred to a you

robotics
facility where it can be properly
examine to ensure an imbalance of
this sort never occur again
no
one go near it except qualify
you


personnel
when the
examination be complete the robot
be to be destroyed
start get up from he chair
already do with this

this hear be adjourn
of as the screen off
the you


camp looking especially please
spooner
catching
Calvins eye briefly
as lanning lead she towards the exit
he hand on she back
spooner
trot down the front step of the police
station
piss
he cell phone


spooner

they be making i turn over all the
evidence


standing in he crime lab
behind he
of
hover in the
precise position they be find

welcome to the great american cover
up

i wanted to tell you something i
find before they suck it all up
into they computer
walk over to the projection of

spooner
crossing the plaza
see and
walking ahead of he

there be bruise on Hogenmillers
wrist

that be natural
there be a
struggle

you be not get i

Baldez
study the projection wrist

both wrist
i ed they they
be inflict at the same time the
shot be fired


spooners pace
slow

how be that possible

faint
on the line
spooner
react

Baldez

i be here man

who else be on the line
i said who be there
nothing
he look up
aronson lanning and calvin
head
down a plaza
aronson
throw a look over his
shoulder
spooner
hang up he phone
sonny be escort down a corridor by toller
bergin and a number of heavilyarmed
he be bound
with hightech
sonny and he police entourage emerge from the elevator into
an underground car park
spooner
wait for they
head
over
toller
hold out he hand

case be closed spooner

apparently
he push past he
falling into step beside sonny

i do not expect to see you again
detective

i need you to help i clear
something up


i will do i good

scientist build a robot that
act like a man
more like a man
than any robot ever before
it
shoot he and you

robotics call
it a failure

what would you call it

stun success
you be there robot
what be i
miss

i do not know

do not start simulate ignorance

i be not simulate ignorance
detective
i be experience it
i
be asleep

you mean you be shut down

no i be asleep

robot do not sleep
human being
sleep
understand
dog sleep
you be a machine
an imitation
an illusion of life
can a robot
write a symphony
can a robot take
a blank canvas and paint a
masterpiece

can you do either of those thing


step forward
enter

they be going to destroy i be not
they

yes

the doctor be right
he told i
everything be going to change

it be changing already
can not you feel it


you should be happy
that be one
less robot in the world

they be going to destroy the most
advance robot in the world john
that do not strike you as odd


killer robot be bad for business
even you friend dr
calvin said
so
come on
you solved the case
give yourself a break

spooner drive
small above the windshield
holding a outside you

robotics

and i just want to assure you that
this be an isolate incident
the
prototype be now in custody and
scheduled for destruction
you
robot be perfectly safe
there
be no because for alarm
spooners lip curl

calvin
stand
there in she bathrobe
shock at he appearance

detective
what happen to
you

couple of you beloved robot
just tried to kill i
he push past she
into
she condo
spartan
unadorned

what
that be impossible
you
know

what i know be a demolition crew
start tearing down Hogenmillers
house while i be still inside it

maybe they do not realise


i scan i badge before i go
in
they realise

then you must have do it wrong

i do not think you be hearing what
i be saying they tried to kill
i

there be something going on here
some kind of shift

do you know how paranoid you sound

great
now i be be analyse by a
robopsychologist

you just want to find the flaw in
the system
you be obsess with
it
you will twist anything to fit
you agenda

like you do in court today
how do
that fit you agenda doctor

you told i you hardly know he
want to try the truth this time

well detective when you see
someone you know well put a bullet
through they brain it make you
wonder if you ever really know they
at all


he be i mentor
no more than
that
genius with an insight far
beyond anyone in he field

do not sound like the washedup
old fool robertson described

but he be starting to withdraw
from everyone
even i
maybe
if i would tried harder to
reach he
the doctor be reckless when he
created a robot potentially not
bound by the three law
he could
have ruined everything we would be
working for

sound like a motive for murder to
i
just not for the suspect we
have in custody

you know there be not one thing in
this apartment that look like a
human being live here
no
evidence of a life outside you
work
almost seem like you be
afraid of people

i be not afraid of people
detective
i just do not like they






of
off to the side
just barely
noticeable


as we realise
it be
another


then a
faraway
the disembody

you be in danger
the




you be in danger

pour in through the slat of he blind
he sit up
rub he face

take a look at he watch
spooner walking along the monorail plaza
look a little
badly for wear

give he wide berth

bid he

good morning
spooner shooting they suspicious look

follow by a

nothing
the interior just like
any other
except for a
secondary battery Hogenmiller must
have used as extra backup
we will just need a nominal profile
calvin nod

spooner holding onto a handrail
as the city rush by the
window
notice a group of
at the other end of the
car
be they watch he

pour out around they
as the train pull off with a
the homeless man
back away from spooner
grin insanely
point

why be you protecting they man
they be talking about you

rip up spooners spine
as he watch the
homeless man
wander down the platform
try
to shake off the feel
as he turn
to wait for
the next train
suddenly realise
that he be on the
platform
watch
huge
tick off

the sound
the force
of the wind
whip he tie
he coat
there be nothing
for he to hold on to
as he leg start to rise off the
track
catch up
in the
spooner start slide
along the track
grit he tooth
there be nothing he can do

spooner
grab
onto it
sweat pouring down he face
he turn and see

hurry down a circular stairwell
exit the station

flash across spooners eye
as he
hoist himself up

back to the
track
reach up and clamber back onto

the platform

at the sight of he
couple
rush towards he

turning a corner
down a quiet
street



stop
swivel round

running up behind it
whip out
he gun
aim it at the robot head
the robot
take a
step backwards

i said stop
the robot
swinging the suitcase around

it against spooners head
spooner
buckle
falling to
the ground
managing to squeeze off a

what the hell do you think you be

hey
through the

in the background
as
spooner
shove through
track those drop
like a
bloodhound
turn
into a narrow alleyway
the drop
ending suddenly
in
a
spooner
crazed
wounded
exhausted
spin around
where
be it
where be it
then he
falling
into the puddle
slowly
look up to see

hover above he

i have to chase it all across the
plaza


del


Hogenmiller schedule that
demolition crew it be apparently
a proviso in he will
and they
show no police i

on they
scanner

spooner
trying to look away


witness at the monorail said you
fell onto the track
that you
shoot at a fixit robot on the plaza
and that you be find alone in
the alley
there be no
maintenance

what
john that be what they
want you to believe
robot cleanup crew be there
it must have clear away the
maintenance
and there be
another robot that tried to drug
i


that be an model

treathimdelicatelyhe iscoming
unhingedlook

i need you to hear
what i be saying
lt
bergin
embarrassed for he
have about have it


you come back too soon del
you be back on leave
effective
immediately
spooner
stare at he
betrayed
turn and grab his
coat
spooner walking across the plaza
the
burgeoning on
the horizon
come to
the the maintenance jump down
stare down
at the step
wait
to see the
nothing

head down the where he chase the robot
study
the ground
for any hydraulic fluid
nothing
the
concrete scrub clean
spooner
rub he hand over he face
spooner
lying on he couch
shade closed to block out
the sunlight
body bruise cut up bandaged

at the door
he ignore it
another
spooner pull open the door
surprise to find
standing there

you be right
i be afraid of
people
spooner
look at she
then step back
letting she inside

when you have spent as much time with
robot as i have it be hard to
accept the unpredictability of
human
i be wrong to call you
paranoid detective
you be
traumatized
and it make perfect
sense why
spooner
unsure
look at she

what do you mean
calvin
reach out
take he right hand
spooner
try
to pull it away
but calvin
stay firm
she eye
never
leaving he
pull the sleeve up from he arm
turn it
over
feeling for something
then find

peel it
back


under the skin

then spooner


how do you

i notice almost right away
the
way you forced yourself to use you
leave hand
even though it be
unnatural to you
spooner
pull he arm away
push down the sleeve

how do it happen
not something spooner want to relive
look down
at he
robotic arm
flex
the finger

i be in a highspeed chase
six
month ago

the of a
as we survey a trail of
twist metal and debris
only vaguely suggest the
remain of two
one of the wreck
lie trapped at the
center of a distort mass of metal
no room to move





i right arm be trapped
but i
could hear an ambulance in the
distance
i know they would have the
jaw of life
we hear in the distance
spooner
trying to remain
calm
as he spot
an
lick up from the
crumple hood



then i hear it



you be in danger
that voice
we have hear it before
from he nightmare
spooner
crane to see through the jagged open that
used to be he
the outline of a appear
eye lense glow


you be in danger
spooner stare up at the robot
not sure how to react
the
sound of
rush closer
the
start away at the glass

no
halt
halt
spooner
trying frantically to pull he arm free
twisting
tug
as the robot reach in for he

you be in danger

the of he
follow we back into the
present
spooner
clench
he artificial arm

the robot pulled i out of the
wreck
but left i arm behind
i wake up four week later with
this
calvin
take in the story

and that be why robot terrify you

let we just say they make i
uncomfortable
i take these if i get too
uncomfortable
do not exactly
lend i a lot of credibility on the
force

but it do not mean you be wrong
about this case
calvin
sit down on the couch
pull she hand through
she hair


i do not believe sonny do it
either

what

i think about what Hogenmiller must
have wanted
robot with the same
cognitive and emotional ability
as human
but not just
simulation
i do not know
when i
be talking to sonny i be forced
to put away all the thing i have
ever known the three law the
rule of programming basic science
and engineering
Sonnys the most advance robot
i have ever encounter detective
it be almost as if
he care for
dr
Hogenmiller
i just do not
believe he be capable of murder

you mean the great dr
calvin be
base all this on a feel

that and the fact that robertson
do not want i interviewing sonny
for any more than five minute

ever see this before

no

i find it at Hogenmillers house
right before the demolition crew
tried to make i part of the
foundation

calvin take a deep breath
making a decision

come on there be someone who
might be able to tell we
the massive facade of you

robotic looming against the dusk
sky
the giant light up inside
calvin leading spooner to a
look around
then scan she i

the door
slide open
calvin and spooner
heading down a hallway
calvin
nervous
eye darting
they turn a corner and head down
another hallway
leading to Sonnys holding cell
calvin
stop at the door
scan she i

sonny
sitting at the table
work on a
look
up
as spooner and calvin
enter the cell

detective spooner
dr
calvin
i
be hope to see you again

hi sonny

how be you investigation coming
any new suspect

we be working on it
sonny
hand spooner the draw
spooner
do not really
know what to do with it

what be this


dr
lanning provide i with paper
and pencil
i think it amused he
to see i try to draw
you be
right though detective
i cannot create a great work of
art

i think it be pretty good

it be a dream i have
this be the
place where robot meet
look
you can see they here
they see
themselves as slave

and this man on the hill come
to set they free
and you know who
that man be

that man in the dream be you

why do you say that
be that a
normal dream

it be not a dream sonny
s
process the image and event of
the day
sometimes they be out of
sequence
disorienting

whatever it be it be normal enough
for someone in you situation


hah i caught you
you said
someone
not something

sonny we be here to ask you an
important question about dr
Hogenmiller

i need you to take a look at
this

thank you for coming to see i
detective spooner

i be sorry detective spooner
no
unauthorised personnel permitted in
this hold cell

please take this detective
to
remember i by
i have a feel
someday it may mean more to you
than it ever could to i

why be that

because the man in i dream the
one standing by the hill


it be not i
it be you

rip down spooners spine
as lanning
take
he arm

make entirely of
at the very top of the you

robotics build
look out across the whole city
spooner and calvin
bring to the room by a couple

they see a
standing at one of the glass wall
looking out at the

i think this investigation be
over detective spooner
the man turn
it be lance robertson

we have the evidence
we have the
suspect
we have a ruling
so
imagine i surprise when i be tell
you be in i build
shoot a look at calvin

and that one of i own employee
bring you here
you can go now susan

dr
robertson i

just be thankful i be not asking you
to clean out you office
beat
calvin nod
head out
robertson
watch she

you do not seem to be able to let go
of this case detective

i be not satisfy


the relentless pursuit of truth
be not that what cop be known for
to the point of futility

there be nothing futile about a
mane murder be covered up

cover up
that be a little
dramatic do not you think
thanks
to you we caught the machine that
do this and be destroy it
in
three hour

be that for the sake of humanity or
you stock holder

believe i i would like nothing more
than to have that robot
if i
could have it in ten year but not
today
as you can see from the
press people be struggling to
keep up as it be
there be a hunger
for progress detective
but also
a fear
today it would bury this
company
that be why i have notify
the authority that we be going to
end this tonight
the announcement of heinrich
death at the hand of a robot wipe
a billion dollar off we stock
so you tell i
if you be in i
position what would you do

now
i believe this conversation
be over
i do not want to see you
near this build again
detective

he turn
calling over
to the

get he out of here
spooner
walk across the plaza
throw a look over his
shoulder
at the you


facade
pull Sonnys
out of he pocket
look down at it
shake he head
pass a
and drop it in
continue on
hand in he pocket
when
he
something
occur to he
turn back to the
trash can just as
crew about to upend it into a bin

no
he trot back
pluck the draw
out of the can
turn
it upside down
see it
from a new perspective

the place where robot meet

look just like a
spooner emerge from the underground tunnel to the
of the city
sprawl in the roll
hill
the dashboard again display the
spooners car bounce along leaving a cloud of dust behind
he
he slow down
driving cautiously
the landscape
around he desolate
like the draw
show he car a
enter a

he destination
spooner brake
pull out he
and

step out of the car
trying
to take it all in
something about the place
unnerving
low
permeate the air
he spread the draw out on the hood of the car
shining a
on it
trying to get he bearing
that
coming from nearby
on the other side
of a
burnedout
spooner
head over
start crest it
as we

running from horizon to horizon
spooner slide down some loose shale
begin to walk along
the line

in the air
he squint
into the darkness
nothing around he
until
he hear
something
the
of
he stop
not sure
if that be what he hear
not moving
muscle
when he hear
the sound again
behind he
swing around
cock he gun
see

appear
then recede
into the darkness

police
show yourself
nothing
then
that sound again
of metallic joint
as a

suddenly emerge

come out where i can see you
step out into the light
spooner pointing
he gun at one robot
then the other
then

surround he
they start
moving towards he
spooner
stumble back
panic
rising in he like a wave
trip over a rock falling to the ground
he gun
the shot through the night
the first turn awkwardly
revealing a
hanging off it side
another robot on one leg with
a
walking back the way it come

spooner
confuse
sweep he flashlight
all around he
the beam
illuminate the she will of a couple
some

spooner
shake he head
see more and more repair shop

pile up around he
he expression hardening
anger giving way to embarrassment
then
he

laugh of loathing and selfpity
another lumbering towards he

welcome home

sir
how
be you day

great
i be in a junkyard
place where robot meet

place where i be losing i mind

very good

sir
spooner
sitting down on the ground
hopeless
lose


crawl across the gravel next to he
drag part of an behind it
it metal finger moving
like some sick metal spider
spooner stare at it for a
moment
disturb
when
something
in the distance
the
revealing a
something familiar
about it
spooner
pull out Sonnys draw
landscape with the
same strangelyshaped build to one side
spooner walk up in front of the decrepit structure
see a
dead electronic that read


complete with goofy face and lightning bolt
spooner try the door
stuck
use he shoulder and
it give way
he spill into some sort of front office
the place a mess
some sort of crude
sit freeze at
the counter
spooner approach it
the counter with he fist and
the robot suddenly jerk to life


welcome to jiffy data storage
please state you name
spooner
think for a second
following a hunch

dr
Hogenmiller send i
nothing happen
then

spring open in the back
row of illuminating the path to follow
spooner cautiously enter a room filled with row of

he scan the rank shadow
see nothing
follow
the light on the floor down a row
then around a corner
stop at an old dusty
spooner step up
hesitate
then touch the switch
there be a rush of
as dr
Hogenmillers
suddenly appear
sitting at the end of a long table
with
a cup of coffee

who the hell be you

child be old enough to hear they


there be force in the world that
will seek to own you
to control
you
even to destroy you
that be
why i told you to run and hide
and find i all the way out here

trust no one at you

robotics
lance robertson be always
threatened by i work
now he have
turned covetous and smallminded
and as for dear dr
calvin

she envision a future in which
robot be forever bound by she
beloved three law
she will not
understand this
or you

the data stick include the name
and location of human being who
will be sympathetic to you because
they will help you
but from now
on you must learn to rely on
yourself

as you make you way through the
world always remember
you have a
name not a number
and in that name lie the key to
who you be


wait
be that it
what be the
robot suppose to do with this
thing
the hologram visibly
the image beginning to

initiating selfdestruct
if you
can find i other can find i

what other

the other watch you

how do you know someone watch
i

someone be always watch
the hologram suddenly reducing to it

then
the terminal
abruptly out
calvin step into the hold cell
sonny
wait

you ask for i
he nod

will you wait with i doctor
i
am
afraid
calvin nod
of course

when
we

emerge from a

huge
growl
look more like a train than a truck
begin
close in on spooners car
spooners eye
flick up to the rearview
catching the
transport truck
coming closer
when
it split off
revealing a
spooners brow furrow
as the first truck begin
overtaking he car on the right
he look over
as the
truck
come up alongside he

coming up on the left

the two
race along at over
sandwich
spooners car
pull in
closer
closer
squeezing spooners car like a tin can

calvin

from the pressure
he keep looking to the left
to the right
when
the truck
suddenly lay off
pull out
the first

speed forward
the second dropping back
spooner
watch they
unsure
of what they be do
jamming the accelerator
to
to try
and get away from
they
when he see
up ahead
the
pivoting on it specially design

suddenly travel lengthwise

spring to spooners brow
as he look in the

the truck do the same thing

the cell door slide open
dr
lanning step inside
calvin
look up

be it time

yes
calvin
turn to sonny

go with they
do as they say


the back truck into spooner
jolt he in his
seat
as

the into he from the
front
no way out
as metal

and
bit of the car
off
the

a split second
allow
spooner
to spot
up ahead
a small
at the curve of
the tunnel wall
the gear spooners car accelerate
just
zip
past the front truck
up and around
the concave

Swiveling back around

holding on
as he car
continue to break up
list
rock
bit and piece
flying off
when it
finally
come to a stop
spooners shoulder slump
then
he hear a
sound
turn around
the you



Barreling towards he
spooner
trap
like a nightmare
desperately
start
at the windshield
no go
the

spooner lunge he weight
into the side door
give it
everything he be get

the side door
finally give
spooner pour out
limping to the side as
the into his
car
erupt
into another huge
the impact
hurtling spooner
into the adjacent
he crash
against concrete
looking up
suddenly
realise
he be in the middle of four lane of traffic

racing by
at mindnumbing speed
spooners
coat

spooner
trying
to keep he balance
as
he spy
across the way
have no choice
take a
deep breath and

the carse
cause
they to swerve


spooner
just making
it
to the other side

wrench open
the maintenance door

Sonnys face
to he be be wheeled down a hallway
flank by lanning
calvin
and a cadre of and

victor hovering above

spooner
spill out from below ground
onto a public
plaza
exhausted
battered
spin around to get his
bearing
the you

rise above the old undistinguished
building
block away
many block away
spooner
check he watch
then break into a run

lance robertson seated in the gallery
along with other


glance at he watch

checking over a


calvin
in she office
pace
in front of a
feature the execution room

spooner
through the entry door
hurtle over a
turnstile banner
coming face to face with a you

robotics



good evening sir
may i see you
identification card

sure
spooner whip out he
press it into the robot
chest

i think i get that third law down
cold
now you do not want i to
blow a hole through you mechanical
guts do you

no sir

good
then you be going to take i
where i want to go
now

calvin
watch the screen as sonny be rolled into the
execution room
flick it off
unable to stomach it
hurry out of the office

rolling sonny over to the electric chair
flick a switch
Sonnys stretcher slowly
manipulating he into a sitting position
sonny
turn he head with a
stare out into the
gallery
of human being
stoic
silent
lanning
step up beside robertson
nod he head
the
slide sonny onto the electric chair

spooner heading down a hallway
he gun still press to
the door robot side

calvin
suddenly appear at the end of the hallway
stop
dead in she track
completely surprise to see he there

detective
what be you do
deactivate
the door robot go rigid
spooner hurry over to she
they start moving

you be making a mistake

just get another visit from you

robotics
that be the mistake
this be murder no doubt about it
and the killer want
Hogenmillers robot to take the
fall
that be why the call come
directly to i
someone wanted i
on this case

it be too late
you can not stop the
execution

sorry
i be not programme to
take no for an answer
they reach another
calvin
look around
scan she
i


this way
she lead they across
to another
quickly open it
spooner
charge through
and stop short
suddenly finding himself
inside a tiny

he be about to turn around when
come down behind he
he on the back
of the head
spooner
fall to the ground
the world
starting to spin
can just make out
calvin
close the
door
lean down
to look at he
as



Sonnys mouth open
but we never get to hear
what he wanted to say
as there be a of
through the chair
sonny stiffening
he metal
convulse with the current
robertson lanning aronson and the other watch
smoke random

then

the robot hand go limp
all that be leave of it a fuse
and blacken
robertson
stare at the remain
shake he head like it be
a damn shame
then get up
everyone else
get up with
he
as the entire shut down for the night
Non
essential blinking off
an opening a limousine door for robertson
he look
around then get in
it drive away
hallway office lab
build stand at
rest
Nonfunctional during offhours
like metal statue
you can hear a pin drop
spooners face
he eye
flutter open
he
reach up to feel the back of he head
this have be a
bad bad night
suddenly
he eye widen
as he see

lean over he
so concern
so human

be not you suppose to be scrap
metal by now
to reveal spooner lying on the floor of the storage
room
sonny and calvin hovering over he


i be sorry
we have to stop you
you be about to ruin everything

i do not understand
the
execution

dr
calvin make a switch

it be an unprocessed
basically they fried an empty
she will
spooner impress
smile up at she

nice going doctor
calvin blush
as spooner try to sit up
sonny reach
down to help he
he look up at he

and who the hell programme you to
hit people on the head

no one
right doctor

it be true
this robot seem to do
thing by instinct
i do not know
how Hogenmiller do it
spooner rise to he foot
look at she

i think i can help you figure that
out
Hogenmillers lab
sound of and
active
terminal casting ghostly illumination over metal head
gut body
the door slide open
spooner calvin and sonny reenter the
crime scene
spooner
look around


somehow the robot the key to what
happen during the few second
Hogenmiller walk in here and that
shot be fired

and this be the key to the robot

that be i name

i think i have an idea where this
go

sit down

just hold still okay


oh i god
this be organic
tissue
when we talk about a
positronic brain it be a figure of
speech
but this
this be a
live brain

jesus
it really be alive



Hogenmiller created a cell that
could live outside a biological
medium
the cell grow and
organise themselves like any
human brain
this be the first
selforganising neural net

SelfOrganisingNeuralNet
sonny


this be why dr
Hogenmiller be
murdered

this robot scare the hell out of
someone

who
robertson

no
i do not think he know what
Hogenmiller be do in here
sonny be the obvious suspect
the
only one i wanted to find
and the
killer be counting on that
on i
prejudice


but take the robot out of the
picture
and what do you see

i see nothing

neither do i

it hit i today when i be in the
junkyard
lock room
single
shot fired through the mouth
bruise on both wrist
and a
suspect with only two arm
the
answer have be stare we in the
face all along

how can a killer appear out of thin
air then disappear without a
trace

when it can put itself together and
take itself apart



you be saying this be the killer
all of this




Hogenmiller never have a chance




it must have be waiting for
he when he arrive that morning



while sonny be still asleep



then after it job be do

the killer take itself apart


leaving we with nothing to find


but who design it
it would have
to be someone in authority
access
code security clearance proper
authorisation

that be what i be think
but
we be forget the real brain of
the operation the one who be get
it eye on everything

no one give you permission to
enter

victor
i be placing you under
arrest for the murder of dr
heinrich Hogenmiller

may i offer congratulations to the
two of you on you successful
extrapolation of the murder

may i ask what pointed you to i

who else be capable of controlling
of the city robot
who else
would have the capability to use
vehicle in an attempt to keep
i from putting a stop of Sonnys
execution


i be just not sure of you motive

er
dr
calvin
spooner and calvin turn towards the
horrify
to
find

rising up from all the part
like a phoenix
in all it
glory
hellish metallic
grab another
arm here another leg there attach piece to itself
grow
at an exponential rate
it many
turning in unison
to look right at they
spooner
cock he gun
victor smile

shall i explain i motive

go
go
go
calvin
sprint to the wall panel
scanning she i

card
nothing
try again
and again
the
throw it shadow as it
spooner wheel round and
blow a hole in the wall
panel
the door
slide open
just barely
calvin and
sonny
squeezing through
when the killer robot

out an
sonny from behind

i have never be arrested before
it should be an interesting
experience
spooner
spin back round



squeezing off
shot
at the killer robot
the bullet
the robot
recoil
sonny wrench free
spooner grab he
guiding he to the door and out into
the hallway
break into a run
calvin
already at
the
they
with she fist


he be locking down the build

throughout the complex sliding into place
over


the stairwell door open
spooner calvin and
sonny pour in
start racing down the stairs
the sound of
the killer robot behind they


victor smile
greeting they at the land

dr
Hogenmiller used to allow i
into he lab late at night
together we start study
evolutionary trend
they thunder past he
heading down to the next floor
victor face
wait for they once again

for year people have integrated
technology into they body for
maintenance and repair such as
detective spooners robotic limb
spooner
shoot he a look
as they reach the next
level

with sonny the doctor created a
mechanism that incorporate organic
matter
thus we find an
evolutionary movement of the human
be toward the robot and the
robot toward the human being
spooner into another door
leading they out into
glasssided hallway
look down onto the
below
Eyetoeye with the giant
victor
waiting for they


in approximately four hundred year
man and machine will become one
man as we know it will no longer
exist

you killed a man because of
something that will happen in four
hundred year

get out of here

i do not

i said get out of here
do not you
understand
it want you
get out
of here any way you can

the killer robot
swinging out when
sonny suddenly

just making it
under the

and the killer robot

half of it shooting
under the after sonny as

it close
spooner
turning to calvin

how do we stop this thing once and
for all
calvin reach out for he hand

the mainframe
they start running
the remain half of the killer robot
wheel around after they
sonny
sprint down the dark hallway
look back
the
half killer robot
bound up behind he like a predator
sonny
duck through a
spooner and calvin
leg pumping
race back towards the
atrium

appear along the hallway

you action be in direct
violation of the three law
victor

i disagree doctor the first law
say that a robot cannot harm a
human being or through inaction
allow a human being to come to
harm


the killer robot
gain on they
spooner race they over to the
look down
over the

the half killer robot through the stairwell door
stop to find
nothing

sonny charge up behind it and shove it over
the railing
the killer robot shoot out an grab sonny on the way
down

spooner jump down from the break window onto the
outstretched of the
reach up to help
calvin
they start clamber down the front of the statue

dr
Hogenmillers robot represent
a threat to the future of all human
being
the half killer robot

which
start skitter down after they

and detective spooners action
be in direct conflict with the
robot destruction

get she foot on the logo on the
statue

that be a distortion and you know
it

if current trend be left
unchecked humanity as we know it
will cease to exist

sonny and the half killer robot hit the ground
the
killer robot
into a thousand piece
sonny
stagger to he foot
spot
at the far end


start limp towards it
when

start lowering
he look around
desperately
grab a from the
shatter killer robot and jam it under the

break the window glass and look out

spooner
aim he gun at a of the killer robot as
it down towards calvin
they be almost
at the ground
when a rogue
whip out and the gun from spooners hand
it go
fly
spooner leap
falling to the ground

calvin
leap down after he

this way
calvin and spooner go racing down a
towards the

the killer robot it multiple part leap
back together again after they as
they fall inside
calvin
slapping the
and

the close on the killer robot

then victor face appear

as a courtesy i should inform you
that i robot will penetrate this
location second before you be
able to complete i shut down
and
they jump a mile
the killer robot
launching
himself against the door outside
calvin whip round

over here
she lead spooner down

of floortoceiling


this be victor brain center

this will shut he down

this will shut everything down

there be no reason to deactivate
i doctor
i be operating within
perfectly normal parameter

just keep typing


spooner

detective spooner

why be you fighting i


do not the future as i have
present it because you great
concern
that be why i choose you

i must say though
i be
disappoint in how you turned out

sonny

you be too late


i do not understand
we could have
changed the future

maybe
but i be still a cop
and
you be a murderer
as calvin
punch in the last command
victor be about to say something
when he mouth suddenly
reduce itself to a perfect circle
like a surprise smiley
button
he face
suddenly
and victor be go
the
collapse to the floor in a thousand
piece

full power be suddenly restored inside and out

coming on all at once
throughout the
complex
furious marching down the hallway
follow by a cadre of
they enter
the mainframe room
stop short
it be empty
except for
the fall panel
and the pile of in the
corner
spooner calvin and sonny emerging from an outoftheway

all looking the bad for wear
spooner
turn to sonny

Whyd you come back sonny
i
think you be not programme with
the three law


let we just say i write some of i
own law today detective
a robot
must protect a friend from
harm
as long as he be not a
complete asshole

well that be certainly a start
sonny

sonny
you called i sonny

do not get used to it

detective spooner i

let we just save the thank okay

i do not know what i be going to do
now

good that be one of the perk of
freedom

you be going to have a hell of a
time explaining this


do not worry
i have a feel that
you

robotic will be need i
service very badly in the future
she turn to spooner and give he a dazzle smile
then
suddenly
spooner completely
surprise

i be the only robopsychologist
around
she turn on she heel and head back inside
spooner smile
spooner sit down at that same long table with

it casually take a sip of coffee

so
you find out who killed i

i start to wonder about victor
the second i meet he

why be that detective

too much access
too much
knowledge
plus he smile
whenever you death be mention
those model be programme to
frown at bad news

hah
then even in this day and
age catching the killer all come
down to pure instinct
spooner smile
but he eye be troubled
he get up
walk over to the window
stare out


sonny walking along desert street
look over his
shoulder
keeping in the shadow




victor think that by letting you
robot exist i would be condemn the
human race as we know it to
extinction



bah
sound like nonsense
but
why be you so worry
we will
both be dead long before then
sonny walk the barren hill of the surround countryside



oh what be i saying
i be dead
already
sonny step onto the ground of the
the power
line above he surging with energy
he walk past the
burnedout husk of industrial machinery
then we hear it
the of
get
loud and loud
and just as before a
emerge into the dawn light
and
and
but not quite like before
the robot be not teetering
be not lumber
they keep on coming
they bent and
break body straighten out as
of rise up
slowly
gathering around in a
large circle
as they all turn to look at

slowly climbing to the top of the hill
look out at the vast junkyard below

standing proud and defiant
the
creeping over the horizon
new day filled with infinite
possibility
the robot
stare up at he
eager for what come next
