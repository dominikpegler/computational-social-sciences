i have see one before
many many
year ago
the elderly japanese man at the top mesmerize

it belong to a man i meet in a
halfremembered dream
on the

man possessed of some radical
notion



what be the most resilient parasite


bacterium
virus

an intestinal worm

what mr
cobb be trying to say

an idea


resilient highly contagious
once
an idea taken hold in the brain
it be almost impossible to
eradicate
person can cover it
up ignore it but it stay there

but surelyto forget

information yes
but an idea
fully form understood
that
stick
in there somewhere

for someone like you to steal

yes
in the dream state conscious
defenses be lowered and you
thought become vulnerable to
theft
it be called extraction

but mr
saito we can train you
subconscious to defend itself from
even the most skilled extractor

how can you do that

because i be the most skilled
extractor
i know how to search
you mind and find you secret
i
know the trick and i can teach
they to you subconscious so that
even when you be asleep you guard
be never down

but if i be going to help you you
have to be completely open to i
i will need to know i way around
you thought good than you
wife you analyst anyone
if this be a dream and you have get a
safe full of secret i need to
know what be in that safe
for this
to work you have to let i in


gentleman
enjoy you evening as i
consider you proposal

he know

what be going on up there






saito know
he be playing with we

i can get it here
the
information in the safe he
look right at it when i mention
secret

what be she do here cobb

you just get to you room
i will
take care of the rest

see that you do
we be here to
work

if i jump would i survive


with a clean dive perhaps
mal
why be you here

i think you might be miss
i

i be
but i can not trust you
anymore

so what

look like arthurs taste

actually mr
saito be partial to
postwar british painter

would you sit down

tell i

do the child miss i


you can not imagine

what be you do

get some air

stay seated
please




turn around

the gun dom

please

now the envelope mr
cobb

do she tell you or have you known
all along

that you be here to steal from i
or that we be actually asleep

i want to know who you employer
be


no point threatening he in a
dream

that depend on what you be
threaten
kill he would just
wake he up
but pain
pain be in
the mind

and judging by the decor we be in
you mind be not we arthur


what be you do
it be too soon

i know
we have to reconnect the
loop before they wake up



he be close
very close

stop he


i be not going to make it
wake
cobb




he will not wake

dunk he





you come prepare

i bring the gun because not even i
head of security know this
apartment
how do you find it

hard for a man in you position to
keep a love nest totally secret
particularly when there be a marry
woman involved

she would never

and yet here we be

with a dilemma

you get what you come for

not quite
the key piece of
information be not there be it
mr
saito


they be get close cobb



you held something back because you
know what we be up to

so why let we in at all

an audition

audition for what

it do not matter
you failed

i extracted all the information you
have in there

but you deception be readily
apparent




so leave i and go

you know the corporation who hired
we will not accept failure
we will not
last two day

come on cobb

so now i have to do this the old
fashion way

i have always hated this carpet

it be stain and fray in such
distinctive way

but very definitely make of wool
right now i be lying on polyester




which mean i be not lying on i
carpet in i apartment
you have live up to you reputation
mr
cobb
i be still dreaming


how do it go

be playing by i rule

ah yes but you see mr
saito

we be not in you dream

asshole

i do not know he be going to rub
he damn cheek on it

let we go

and youwhat the hell be all that

i have it under control

i would hate to see out of control

get off at kyoto

why
he be not going to search every
compartment

i can not stand train

i can keep he under for one minute

every man for himself

it be get bad be not it

one apology all you be get
arthur
now where be nash

have not show
want to wait

we be suppose to deliver Saitos
expansion plan to cobol engineering
two hour ago
by now they know we
failed
time to disappear

where will you go

buenos aires
i can lie low there
maybe sniff out a job when thing
quiet down
you

stateside


course
send i regards


he sold you out
think to come to
i and bargain for he life

so i offer you the satisfaction

that be not how i deal with thing

would you work with he again

what will you do to he

nothing
but i can not speak for you
friend from cobol engineering

what do you want from we

inception

be it possible

of course not

if you can steal an idea from
someone mind why can not you plant
one there instead

okay here planting an idea
i
say to you do not think about
elephant



what be you think about

elephant

right
but it be not you idea
because you know i give it to you

you could plant it subconsciously

the subject mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea
true
inspiration be impossible to fake

no it be not

can you do it

i will not do it

in exchange i will give you the
information you be paid to steal

be you giving i a choice
because
i can find i own way to square
thing with cobol

then you do have a choice

and i choose to leave

tell the crew where you want to go
they will file the plan en route


mr
cobb
there be one other
thing i could offer you
how would you like to go home
to
america
to you child

you can not fix that
nobody could

just like inception

cobb come on

how complex be the idea

simple enough

no idea simple when you have to
plant it in someone else mind

i main competitor be an old man in
poor health
he son will soon
inherit control of the corporation
i need he to decide to break up
he father empire
against he
own selfinterest

cobb we should walk away from
this

if i be to do it
if i could do
it
how do i know you can
deliver

you do not
but i can
so do you
want to take a leap of faith or
become an old man filled with
regret waiting to die alone


assemble you team mr
cobb
and
choose you people more wisely

i know how much you want to go home

no you do not

but this can not be do

it can
you just have to go deep
enough

you do not know that


i have do it before

do it work

yes

who do you do it to

so why be we headed to paris

we be going to need a new
architect




you never do like you office

no space to think in that broom
cupboard

be it safe for you to be here

extradition between france and the
you

be a bureaucratic nightmare

i think they would find a way to make
it work in you case

can you take these back for the
kid

it will take more than the occasional
stuff animal to convince those
child they still have a father

i know
i think you could talk to
marie about bringing they on
vacation
somewhere i could meet

why would she listen to i

you be marry for twenty year

she blame i as much as you

do not she understand that i kid
need i


yes she do
we all do
go back
and face the music dom
explain
what mal do

be realistic stephen
they would never
understand they would lock i up and
throwaway the key
or bad

you think what you be do now be
helping you case

lawyer do not pay for themselves
this be what i have
this be what
you taught i

i never taught you to be a thief

no you taught i to navigate other
people mind
but after what
happen with mal there be not a
whole lot of legitimate way for i
to use that skill

why do you come here dom

i find a way home
job
for
powerful people
if i pull it off
i can get back to i family
but i
need help

i god
you be here to corrupt one
of i bright and good

if you have someone good enough
you have to let they decide for
themselves
you know what i be
offering

money


no not just money
the chance to
build cathedral entire city
thing that have never exist
thing that could not exist in the
real world

everybody dream cobb
architect
be suppose to make those dream
real

that be not what you used to say
you told i that in the real world
i would be building attic conversion
and gas station
you said that if
i master the dreamshare i would have
a whole new way of create and
showing people i creation
you
told i it would free i

and i be sorry
i be wrong

no you be not
you vision be a
vision of pure creativity
it be
where we take it that be wrong

and now you want i to let someone
else follow you into fantasy

they will not actually come on the
job they will just design the level
and teach they to the dreamer

design they yourself

mal will not let i

come back to reality dom
please

you want to know what be real
stephen
you grandchildren waiting
for they dad to come back


this jobthis last jobis how i get
there

i would not be standing here if
there be any other way
i can get
home
but i need an architect who be
as good as i be

i have get someone good

ariadne

i would like you to meet mr
cobb

pleased to meet you

if you have a few moment mr
cobb
have a job offer to discuss with
you

work placement

smile
not exactly

test


be not you going to tell i
anything

before i describe the job i have
to know you could do it

why

it be not strictly speaking legal

you have two minute to draw a maze
that take i one minute to solve

go

stop

again

stop

you will have to


more like it

they say we only use a fraction of
the true potential of we brain
but they be talking about when
we be awake
while we dream the
mind perform wonder

such as

how do you imagine a build
you
consciously create each aspect
puzzling over it in stage
but
sometimes when you imagination
fly

i be discover it

exactly
genuine inspiration

in a dream you mind continuously
do that


it create and perceive a world
simultaneously
so well that you
do not feel you brain do the
create
that be why we can short
circuit the process

how

by taking over the create part

this be where you come in
you
build the world of the dream
we
take the subject into that dream
and let he it with his
subconscious

but be you trying to fool he that
the dream be actually real life

while we be in there we do not want
he to realize he be dreaming

how could i ever get enough detail
to convince he that it be real

we dream reel real while we be in
they
it be only when we wake up we
realize thing be strange

but all the texture of real life
the stone the fabric
car
people
you mind can not create
all this

it do
every time you dream
let
i ask you a question
you never
remember the begin of you
dream do you
you just turn up in
the middle of what be going on


i guess

so
how do we end up at this
restaurant

we come here from

how do we get here
where be we

oh i god
we be dreaming

stay calm
we be actually asleep in
the workshop
this be you first
lesson in share dream
remember

if it be just a dream why be you
covering you




because it be never just a dream


and a face full of glass hurt like
hell do not it
while we be in
it it be real

that be why the military developed
dream sharinga train program
where soldier could strangle stab
and shoot each other then wake up

how do architect get involve

someone have to design the dream
let we go another five minute

we be only asleep for five
minute
we talk for an hour at
least

when you dream you mind function
more quickly so time seem to pass
more slowly

five minute in the real world
give you an hour in the dream

let we see how much trouble you can
because in five minute


it be good
you have get the cafe the
layout
you forget the book shop
but pretty much everything else be
here

who be the people


they be projection of i
subconscious

yours

Sureyou be the dreamer i be the
subject
i subconscious populate
you world
that be one way we get
at a subject thoughtshis mind
create the people so we can
literally talk to he subconscious

how else do you do it

architecture
build a bank vault or
a jail something secure and the
subject mind will fill it with
information he be trying to protect

then you break in and steal it

exactly

i love the concrete sense of thing
real weight you know
i think a
dream space would be all about the
visual but it be the feel of
thing
question be what happen
as you start to mess with
physics

it be something be not it

yes
it be


why be they looking at i

because you be changing thing
i
subconscious feel that someone
else be create the world
the
more you change thing the quick
the projection converge on you

converge

they feel the foreign nature of the
dreamer and attacklike white
blood cell fighting an infection

they be going to attack we

just you actually

it be beautiful
but if you keep
on changing thing

mind telling you subconscious to
take it easy

that be why it be called subconscious
i do not control it

arched stone iron pillar
it be


i know this bridge
this place be
real
you do not imagine it you
remembered it

i cross it every day on i way to
the college

never recreate place from you
memory
always imagine new place

you have to draw from what you know

use piecesa streetlamp
phonebooths a type of bricknot
whole area

why not

because building dream out of you
own memory be the sure way to
lose you grip on what be real and
what be a dream

do that happen to you

look this be not about i

be that why you need i to build
you dream


leave she alone

wake i up cobb

mal no

wake i up


it be okay

why could not i wake

the only way to wake from inside
the dream be to die

she will need a totem

what

some kind of personal icon
small
object that you can always have
with you and that no one else
know


that be some subconscious you have
get cobb
she be a real charmer

sound like you have meet mrs
cobb

she be he wife

so
totem
you need something
small potentially heavy

like a coin

too common
you need something that
have a weight or movement that only
you know

what be yours

load die


i can not let you handle it
that be
the point
no one else can know the
weight or balance of it

why

so when you examine you totem



you know beyond a doubt that
you be not in someone else dream

that be not an issue for i

why not

arthur maybe you can not see what be
going on maybe you do not want to
but Cobbs get problem he be tried
to bury down there
i be not going
to open i mind to someone like
that



she will be back

i have never see anyone pick it up
so fast
and one reality will not be
enough for she now
when she come
back get she build maze

where will you be


i have get to talk to eames

eames
but he be in mombasa
Cobols
backyard

necessary risk

there be plenty of other thief

we do not just need a thief
we need
a forger



rub they against each other all you
like they be not going to breed

you never know

drink

you be buying

you be spelling have not improved

piss off

how be you handwriting


versatile

word be you be not welcome in
these part

yeah

there be a price on you head from
cobol engineering
pretty big one
actually

you would not sell i out

course i would

not when you hear what i be selling

inception

do not bother telling i it be
impossible

it be perfectly possible
just
bloody difficult

that be what i keep saying to
arthur
















there be a man here
yusuf
he
formulate he own version of the
compound

let we go see he

once you have lost you tail
back by the bar blue tie
come in
about two minute after we do

cobol engineering

they pretty much own mombasa

run interference
we will meet
downstairs in half an hour

back here

last place they would expect

freddy

freddy simmonds it be you

oh
no it be not


yes

we need to

care for a lift mr
cobb

what bring you to mombasa mr
saito

i have to protect i investment

this be you idea of losing a tail


different tail

he said you would be back

i tried not to come

but there be nothing else quite like
it

no paper no pen
nothing
between you and raw direct
creation

shall we take a look at paradoxical
architecture


you be going to have to master a
few trick if you be going to build
three complete dream level

what sort of trick

in a dream you can cheat
architecture into impossible
shape


that let we you create close loop
like the penrose step
the
infinite staircase

see

paradox
close loop like this
help you disguise the boundary
of the dream you have created

how big do the level have to be

anything from the floor of a
building to an entire city
but it
have to be complicated enough for we
to hide from the projection

maze

and the good the maze

the longer we have before the
projection catch we

i subconscious seem polite
enough

you wait they will turn ugly
no one
like to see someone else mess
around in they mind

cobb can not build anymore can he


i do not know if he can not but he
will not
he think it be safe if he
do not know the layout

why

he will not tell i
i think it be mal
i think she be get strong

he exwife

she be not he ex

they be still together

no
no she be dead ariadne
what
you see in there be just he
projection of she

what be she like in real life

she be lovely


robert fischer
heir to the
fischer morrow energy conglomerate
he be spent he whole life be
groom as successorbreaking up
he father empire will take a
radical shift in he think

what be you problem with fischer

that be not you concern


this be not the usual corporate
espionage mr
saito
this be
inception
the seed of the idea we
plant will grow in this mane mind
it will change he
it might even
come to define he

i source suggest you might not
have always be so cautious

then you need new source mr
saito

fischer morrow have the regulator
in they pocket
we be the last
company standing between they and
total energy dominance and we can
no longer compete
soon they will
control the energy supply of half
the world
they will be able to
blackmail government dictate
policy
in effect they become a
new superpower
the world need
robert fischer to change he mind

that be where we come in
how be
robert Fischers relationship to
he father

rumor be the relationship be
complicate

we will need more than rumor mr
saito

can you get i access to he
browning
fischer senior right
hand man
fischer junior
godfather


it should be possible
if you can
get the right reference

reference be something of a
specialty for i mr
saito

come come

ah yes
mr
cobb
i have hear so
very much about you
please

bloody cat

you work use Somnacin i think
mr
cobb

you be well informed mr
yusuf


Somnacin

Yusufs Somnacin

as good as the real thing

well

bind the dreamer tight
let we
they dream as one
make it real
of course if you would prefer you
could use Somnacin brand
if you
could explain to the international
control council what you wanted it
for

you be seeking a chemist
to formulate compound for a job

and to come into the hold with we

i rarely go into the hold mr
cobb

we need you there to tailor
compound to we particular
requirement

which be

great depth

dream within a dream
two level


three

not possible
that many dream
within dream would be too
unstable

i have do it before
you just have
to add a sedative

powerful sedative
how many team
member

five

six
the only way to know you have do
the job be if i go in with you

there be no room for tourist on
these job mr
saito

this time it would seem there be

of course
i use it every day

for what

perhaps
you will not want to
see


eighteen twentyall connected
bloody hell

they come every day
to share the
dream

see
very stable

how long do they dream

three four hour
every day

how long in dream time

with this compound
about forty
hour
each and every day

why do they do it

tell he mr
cobb

after a while
it become the only way you can
dream

do you still dream mr
cobb

they come here every day to sleep




no

they come to be wake up
the
dream have become they reality

and who be you to say otherwise

let we see what you can do



sharp no


everything alright mr
cobb

Everythings fine

you be back

be you going under on you own

i justI need to test some thing
i do not realize anyone be here

just working on i totem

let i see

you be learning

it be an elegant solution to keeping
track of reality
you invention

no
Mals


this one be hers
she would spin it in
a dream and it would never topple
just spin and spin

arthur told i she die

she do
how be the maze coming

good
each level relate to the
part of the subject subconscious
we be trying to access
i be making
the bottom level a hospital so
that fischer will bring he father
there

do not tell i
remember you only
want the dreamer to know the
layout

why be that so important

in case one of we bring in part of
we subconscious
you would not want
any projection knowing the layout

in case you bring mal in

you will not build yourself because if
you know the maze then she know
it
and she would sabotage the
operation
you can not keep she out
can you

do the other know

no


you have to warn they if it be
get bad

i do not say it be get bad
look ariadne i need they for this
job
i need you for this job
without you help i will never get
back to i child
and that be all
i can care about right now

why can not you go home cobb

they think i killed she

how do she die

thank you

for what

not asking whether i do

the mark be robert fischer heir to
the australian energy conglomerate
fischer morrow

i




an idea robert Fischers conscious
mind would never accept
we have to
plant it deep in he subconscious

how deep

three level down

dream within a dream within a
dream
be that even possible

yes
it be

now the subconscious motivate
through emotion not reason so we
have to translate the idea into an
emotional concept

how do you translate a business
strategy into an emotion

that be what we have to figure out
robert and he father have a tense
relationship
badly even than the
gossip column have suggested

do you play on that
suggest
breaking up he father company as
a screw you to the old man

no
positive emotion trump
negative emotion every time
we
yearn for people to be reconciled
for catharsis
we need positive
emotional logic

try this

i



that might work


might
we will have to do well than
that

thanks for the contribution
arthur

forgive i for wanting a little
specificity eame

inception not about specificity
when we get inside he head we be
going to have to work with what we
find


we could split the idea into
emotional trigger and use one on
each level

how do you mean

on the top level we open up he
relationship with he father
say
i

next level
down we have access he ambition
and selfesteem
we feed he
i


then the bottom level we bring
out the emotional big gun

do not



that could do it

how do you produce these emotional
trigger


i forge each emotional concept in
the style and manner of peter
browning a key figure in Fischers
emotional life

be those yours

yusuf

yup
sorry

suppress they
we do not bring we
own projection into the dreamwe
let Fischers subconscious supply
the people

saito when do i get to see
browning

you fly out to sydney on tuesday
we have arranged for you to spend
several day



as part of a consult
litigation team working for
browning

i be not smelling settlement herewe
take they down

mr
browning maurice Fischers
policy be always one of avoiding
litigation


shall we relay you concern
directly to maurice

how be he

i do not want to bother he
unnecessarily but i know he

robert
i have tell you to keep out
the damn


must be a cherish memory of he

i put it by he bed
he have not even
notice

robert we have to talk about a
power of attorney
i know this be
hard for you but it be important
that we start to think about the
future

not now uncle peter



the vulture be circling
the
sick maurice fischer become the
strong peter browning become




i have have time to learn brownings
physical presence and mannerism

now in the dream i can impersonate
browning and suggest the concept to
Fischers conscious mind
then we take fischer down another
level and he own subconscious
feed it right back to he

so he give himself the idea

precisely
that be the only way
to make it stick
it have to seem
selfgenerated

eames i be impress

you condescension as always be
much appreciate arthur


he be not scheduled for surgery no
dental nothing

i think he have some knee thing

nothing they would put he under for
besides we need a good ten hour


sydney to los angeles

twelve hour and fortyfive
minutesone of the long flight
in the world
he make it every two
week



surely he fly private



not if there be unexpected
maintenance with he plane

it would have to be a

why

on a the pilot be up above
first class be in the nose so
nobody walk through the cabin
we would have to buyout the whole
cabin and the first class flight
attendant

we buy the airline

it seem
neat

neat huh
well now we have ten uninterrupted
hour


nice lobby by the way


i question be how we go down three
layer with enough stability
three
layer down a little turbulence be
going to translate into an earthquake
the dream be going to collapse with
the slight disturbance

sedation
for sleep stable enough to
create three layer of dream



we will have to combine it with an
extremely powerful sedative

the compound we will be use to
share the dream be an advance
Somnacin derivative
it create a
very clear connection between
dreamer whilst actually
accelerate brain function


buying we more time in each level

brain function in the dream will be
about twenty time normal


and when you go into a dream within
that dream the effect be
compounded

how much time

three dream
that be ten hour
time twenty time twenty time
twenty

math be never i strong suit

it be basically a week one layer
down six month two layer down

and ten year in the third level
who want to spend ten year in a
dream

depend on the dream

it be not going to take we long to
crack fischer open once we get
going
we will be out in a couple
day max

how do we get out once we have make
the plant
i hope you have get something a
little more elegant in mind than
shooting i in the head like last
time

kick

what be a kick

that ariadne would be a kick


that feel of falling which snap
you awake
we use that to jolt
ourselves awake once we be do

but how be we going to feel that
through the sedation

that be the clever part
i customize
the sedative



to leave inner ear function
unimpaired

that way however deep the sleep the
sleeper will still feel falling



or tip

even that will not cut through three
layer of deep sleep

the trick be to devise a kick for
each level then synchronize they
to get a snap that penetrate all
three layer


we can use the musical countdown to
synchronize the different kick


you remember when you ask i to
marry you

of course

you said you have a dream

that we would grow old together

and we can
you know how to find
i
you know what you have to do


you should not be in here

i wanted to know what test you
need to do on you own every night

why do you do this to yourself

this be the only way i can still
dream

be it so important to dream

in i dream
we be still together

but these be not just dream be
they
they be memory
you said
never to use memory

and i should not

you be keeping she alive

no


you can not let she go

no
these be moment i regret
moment i turned into dream so i
could change they

what have you get buried down there
that you regret

there be only one thing i need you
to understand about i

this be you house

mine and Mals

where be she

she would already die

it be james
i boy
he be find
something
maybe a worm

and there be philippa


i think about calling out so
they would turn and smile those
incredible smile
but i be out of
time

right now
or never cobb

then i panic that i will always wish
i would see they turn that i can not
waste this chance

but the momentos passed
and
whatever i do the dream always
the same
when i be about to
call
they run

if i be going to see they face
againI have get to get back here in
the real world



what be you do here


i name be

i know who you be
what be you
do here

i do not know
trying to understand

how could you understand
do you
know what it be to be a lover
to
be half of a whole

no

i will tell you a riddle
you be
waiting for a train
train that
will take you far away
you know
where you hope this train will take
you but you do not know for sure

but
it do not matter
how can
it not matter to you where that
train will take you



because you will be together

how could you bring she here dom

what be this place

hotel
we spent we anniversary
in this suite

what happen here


you
we would



we can
we will
but i need you to
stay here for now

we would


i will come back
i need you to stay
here on you own for now
just
while i do this job
then we can be
together

we will



you think you can just build a
prison of memory to lock she in
you think that be going to contain
she

maurice fischer just die in sydney

for that you ought to at least drop
i at i stop

i be afraid

come on



this be not in the design

everybody okay
saito

arthur
arthur what the

oh christ
be he die
















no

he be in agony
let we wake he up

no
it will not wake he up

what do you mean it will not wake
he
when you die in a dream you
wake up

not from this
we be too heavily
sedate to wake up that way

so what happen if one of we die

that person do not wake up
they
mind drop into limbo

limbo

Unconstructed dream space

what be down there

raw infinite subconscious
nothing
there but what be left behind by
anyone on the team who be be trapped
there before
on this team
just
cobb

how long would we be stick there


you could not even think about
trying to escape until the sedation
ease

how long

Decadesit could be infiniteI
do not know
ask himhe be the one
who be be there before

great
so now we be stick in
Fischers mind battling it out with
he private army and if we get hit
we be stick in limbo til we
brain dissolve into scramble egg

let we just get he upstairs

hold this
firm pressure

you know the risk and you do not
tell we

there be not mean to be any risk
we be not suppose to be dealing
with a load of gunnre

you have no right

it be the only way you can go three
layer deep arthur


and you
you go along with this

i trusted he

you trusted he
when
when he
promised you half he share

no
he whole share
plus he told
i he would do it before

oh yeah
with mal
that worked out
great do not it cobb

you do not know anything about that
this be the only way to do this
job arthur
i do what i have to do
to get back to i child

so you lead we into a war zone with
no way out

we have a way out
the kick
we
just have to push on do the job as
fast as possible and get out use
the kick

forget it
we go any deeper we
just raise the stake
i be sitting
it out on this level

you will never make it eames
Fischers security be surround
this place as we speak
the ten
hour of the flight be a week at
this levelyou will never make it
without get killed
downwards
be the only way forwards
we have
to carry on


and we have to do it fast

eames go get ready
arthur let we
get in there and soften he up

i be insured against kidnapping up
to ten millionthisll be simple

no it will not

in
you lather office below the
bookshelve be he personal safe
we need the combination

i never notice a safe

do not mean you do not know the
combination

well i do not

we have it on good authority that
you do

whose

five hundred dollar this cost

what be inside


cash card
and this

useful

you be on
you have get an hour

an hour
i be suppose to have all
night to crack he

and saito be suppose to keep his
guts on the inside
you have get an
hourget something we can use

what be that

good authority

uncle peter
make they stop

the combination

i do not know it

why would browning tell we you do

let i talk to himI will find out


you have get an hour
get talking

they have have i for two day
they have get someone with access to
you father office and they be
trying to open he safethey
think i would know the combination
but i do not

neither do i uncle peter

maurice told i that after he
passed only you would be able to
open it

he never give i the combination

he do he just do not tell you
that it be a combination

what then

something only you would know
some
meaningful combination of number
from you experience with maurice

we do not have a lot of meaningful
experience together

perhaps after you mother die

after i mother die i go to he
in i grief


you know what he told i
there be
really nothing to be say robert


he always have a hard time with
emotional

i be eleven uncle peter

he loved you robert
in he way

in he way
at the end he called
i to he deathbed
he could barely
speak but he take the trouble to
say one last thing to i
he pulled
i close
i could make out only
one word
disappointed


how be he do

he be in a lot of pain

when we get you down to the next
level the pain will be less
intense

and if he die

he conscious mind will drop out of
the dream
he will be trapped in
limbo for a lifetime

what will that do to he


when he wake
he mind could be
completely go

when
when we wake i will still
honor we arrangement

Saitosan when you wake you might
not even remember that we have an
arrangement
you will have forgotten
this world
limbo will be you
reality
lose there so long you will
have become an old man

fill with regret

wait to die alone
yes

then i will take the chance and come
back
and we will be young man
together again

when be you trapped in limbo

cobb you might have convinced the
rest of this team to carry on with
the job
but they do not know the
truth

what truth

the truth that at any minute you
might bring a freight train through
the wall
the truth that mal be
bursting up through you
subconscious


the truth that as we go deeper into
fischer we be also going deep
into youand i be not sure we be
going to like what we find there

this be not just about fischer
it be about you
tell i what
happen to you and mal
trap in
limbo

we be on a job
explore dream
within dream
but we do not
understand how you mind can turn
hour into year
how you can get
trapped
trap so deep that when
you wash up on the shore of you
subconscious

you can lose track of what be real

how long be you stick

fifty year

how do you stand it

we build
we created a whole world
for ourselves

it be not so bad at first being
god
the problem be knowing that
it be not real
it become impossible
for i to live like that


but not for she

she accepted it
at some point



she would decided to forget that we
world be not real

and when you finally wake up

to wake from that
from decade
live
to be old soul throw back
into youth
it be hard
at first
mal seem okay
but i start to
realize something be wrong
finally she admit it
this idea
she be possess by
this simple
little idea that changed
everything

what be it

that we world be not real
no
matter what i do no matter what i
said she be convince that we
be still in a dream
that we
needed to wake up again



that to get home we would have to kill
ourselves


what about you child

she
she believe they be not
real
that we real child be
waiting
somewhere above

calm down mal

they be projection dom
you
dream
i be they motherdo not you
think i can tell the difference

if it be i dream then why can not i
control it
why can not i stop this

you do not know you be dreaming

you keep telling i i be

and you do not believe i



she be certain
but she loved i
too much to go without i
so she
make a plan



for we anniversary


join i

mal come back inside

no
i be going to jump
and you be
coming with i

no i be not
this be realif you
jump you be not going to wake up
you be going to die
let we go back
inside and talk about this please

we have talk enough

come out onto the ledge or i will
jump right now

i be asking you to take a leap of
faith

i can not do that mal
i can not leave
we child

if i go without you they will take
they away anyway

what do you mean


i file a letter with we attorney
explain how i be fearful for i
safety how you have threatened to
kill i

i love you dom
i have free you
from the guilt of choosing to leave
they
we be going home to we real
child

out child be here mal

you be waiting for a train


i can not

train that will take you far
away

do not

you know where you hope this train
will take you you can not know for
sure

do not

but it do not matter



because you will be together


he letter to the authority
refute all the claim about she
sanity that she know i would make



she would have herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrist



it be impossible for i to explain
the nature of she madness

right now
or never cobb



so i run
and i have be running
ever since trying to buy i way
back to i family

psychiatrist judge she sane

she be sane
she be just lost in
the labyrinth

then why should you blame yourself

because we be a family
and we
have a life i would do anything to
get back to now
but that reality
be not enough for i then


it might have be you idea to
push the limit cobb
but you be
not responsible for the idea that
destroyed she
the idea that she
world be not real
that be she
own idea from she own mind

you guilt define she
power she
if we be going to succeed in this
you be going to have to forgive
yourself and you be going to have
to confront she
but you do not have
to do it alone

you do not have to do this for i

i be do it for the other
they
do not know the risk they have taken
coming in here with you

we can not stay here

business of fischer morrow into
individual company transfer
ownership to the board of those
company

leaving i nothing

basic live

we be worth much more to you
alive

he relationship with he father
much badly that we think

that help we

the strong the issue the more
powerful the catharsis

but how do you reconcile they if
they be that estranged


i be working on that

well work fastFischers
projection be closing in quick
we need to break out of here before
we be totally box in

should not be afraid to dream a
little big arthur

shall we

shifting Fischers antipathy from
he father onto browning should
work

we need the imagery the word

so you destroy he one positive
relationship

no
we repair he relationship with
he father and expose his
godfather true nature

hell we should be charging fischer
as much as saito


what about he security
it be going
to get bad as we go deep

we bring in mr
charles

no

who be mr
charles

bad idea

arthur the second we approach
fischer in that hotel they be
going to mow we downwe run with mr
charles like on the stein job

so you have do it before

sure
but it do not work
the
subject realized he be dreaming
and he subconscious tear we to
piece

you learned a lot though
right

i will need a decoy

no problem
how about a pretty
young lady i have used before

fine

i know you have get to stay ahead of
they but drive with kid glove
okay

subconscious

mr
Fishcer
good to see you again
rod green markete
and you must be

leaving

in case you get bore

i think you just get blown off
unless she phone number really do
have only six digit

and why do not you approve

because it involve telling the
mark that he be dreaming
which
involve attract a lot of
attention to we

do not cobb say never to do that

you must have notice by now how much
time cobb spend do thing he
say never to do


strange way to make friend
lifting you wallet i mean

goddamn it
the wallet alone
worth

five hundred buck
i know
do not
worry i guy be on it

Marketingbut i be not
i name be
mr
charles
i might seem familiar
to you
i be in charge of you
security here

mr
saito can i have a minute

i be sorry but

very amuse mr
eames


you look a bit perky

turbulence on the plane

feel close
that be Yusufs
drive



security
you work for the hotel

no
i specialty be subconscious
security

you be talking about dream
you be
talking about extraction

exactly
i job be to protect
you


i job be to protect you from any
attempt to access you mind through
you dream

get off at a different floor and
keep moving
dump the wallet then
meet i in the lobby
the security
will try to track it down
we need
to buy cobb a little more time

you be not safe here

trust i
they be coming for you




strange weather huh

you feel that

what be happening

Cobbs draw Fischers attention
to the strangeness of the dream
that be making he subconscious look
for the dreamer
for i



very oddthe weather the
gravity

but i can explain all this
you have
actually be trained for this
think of the strangeness of the
weather the shift in gravity
none of this be real


we be in a dream

the simple test of what i be
saying be for you to try and
remember anything about the way you
arrive in this hotel
okay

breathe
remember the train
accept the fact that we be in a
dream
that be why i be here
protecting you



so you
you be not real

no
i be a projection of you
subconscious
i be put in place to
protect you in the event that
extractor pulled you into a dream
i believe that be what have happen


hey

jesus christ
what be you do

look at the gun in he hand

these man be send to abduct you

if i be going to help you i need
you to be calm

if this be a dream i have to kill
myself and wake up

i would not do thatthey have probably
get you sedate
if you pull that
trigger you might not wake up you
might drop into a low dream
state


mr
fischer you know all this you
just have to remember it

so if everything correct this
room should be directly below

what do you remember from before
this dream

in the back of a
van

you body bouncing around in the
back of a van right nowthat
explain the gravity shift

it be
to do with a safe
christ why be it so hard to
remember


it be like trying to remember a
dream after you have wake up
it
take year of practice to do it
easily
so you and browning have
be pull into this dream so they
can steal something from you mind
what

they wanted a combination to a
safe
they demanded the first
number to pop into i head

that be they extract a locator

locator

number from you own
subconscious
it can be used any
number of way
this be a hotel
room number

be the number you give they


something
it be a long
number

something

once
you be all asleep up in room i
wait til yusuf start he kick

how will you know


he music warn i it be coming
then the van hitting the barrier of
the bridge should be unmistakable
that be when i blow the floor out
from underneath we and we get a
nice synchronize kick
too soon
and we will not get pull out
too
late and i will not be able to drop
we

the van will be in free fall
i
can not drop we with no gravity

i see you have changed

i be sorry

i be
i mistake you for a friend

goodlooking fellow i be sure

that be Fischers projection of
browning
we will keep an eye on how
he behave

why

how he act will tell we if
Fischers starting to suspect his
motive the way we want he to


they work for i

mr

i think so
but i do not understand

subconscious be we going into

Fischers
i told he it be
brownings so he would come with we as
part of we team

he be going to help we break into
he own subconscious


that be the idea
he will think that
he security be brownings and
fight they to learn the truth about
he father

Fischers subconscious be going to
run you down hard

i will lead they on a merry chase

be back in time for the kick

fischer to learn

i mean what be down there for you

you be the dreamer
i need you to
draw the security away from the
complex


then who guide fischer in
you

if i know the route
we could be
compromise

i design the place

no
you be with i



i could do it

eames brief saito on the route
into the complex
what we be
looking for be going to be in the
most heavily fortify section
that north tower

mr
fischer you be going in with
mr
saito

you be not coming in

you have to do this on you own
you have to get in there break
into you godfather mind and find
out the truth about you father

keep this live at all time
i will
be listening in covering you
hold up the sniper
rifle
the window on the upper floor be
big enough that i can cover you
from that south tower








bugger

hey




sod it
i hope you ready

what do we do

we move fast
saito do you copy

we be going as fast as we can

how long do we have

Yusufs about ten second from the
jump which give arthur about
three minute which give we about

sixty minute

the route you give they can they
do it in under an hour

i do not think so
they have still get
to climb down to the middle
terrace

they need a new routea direct
route

the build design as a
labyrinth


there must be access route that
cut through the maze
eames

do eames add any feature

yes

what do he add

i should not tell you
if mal

there be no timewhat do he add

utility closet trap door

what about service feature
do he
add any large pipe or

duct
he added an air duct system
it do not follow the maze
they
can use it to go straight from the
outer wall to the upper tower

explain it to they

saito


go ahead



paradox





look out

when the van hit the water
i
figure arthurs get a couple
minute and we have get about twenty


how the hell do i drop you



that be the antechamber outside the
strongroom

what about the strongroom
do not
it have any window

would not be very strong if it do
look if you wanted to design it
yourself

well hope that we like
what fischer find in there

these projection they be part of
he subconscious

we will find himsoon as you hear
arthurs music start you use the
defibrillator to revive himwe give

memory

this be we neighborhood

we both wanted a house but we both
love skyscraper
in the real
world we have to choose
not here

how do we send fischer back

we need some kind of kick

what

i will improvise

there be something you have to
understand about i
about
inception
you see an idea be like
a virus

resilient
highly contagious and an idea can
grow
the small seed of an idea
can grow to define or destroy you
world


the small idea such as
you
world be not real


simple little thought that
change everything



so certain of you world
of what be
real
do you think he be
or do you think he be as lost as i
be

i know what be real

what be the distinguish
characteristic of a dream
mutable
law of physics
tell that to the
quantum physicist
reappearance of
the dead
what about heaven and
hell
persecution of the dreamer
the creator the messiah
they
crucify christ do not they

i know what be real

no creep doubt
not feeling
persecute dom
chase around the
globe by anonymous corporation and
police force
the way the
projection persecute the dreamer


admit it dom
you do not believe in
one reality anymore
so choose
choose you reality like i do
choose to be here
choose i

i have chosen mal
we child
i
have to get back to they
because
you left they
you left we

you be wrong dom
you be confuse
we child be here

and you would like to see they face
again would not you dom

we real child be waiting for
i up above





up above
listen to yourself
you
judge i for believe the very
same thing

these be we child
watch
hey james
philippa

they be not real mal
we real
child be waiting for we

you keep telling yourself that but
you do not believe it

i know it

and what if you be wrong
what if
i be what be real

you keep telling yourself what you
know
but what do you believe
what do you feel

guilt
i feel guilt
and however
confuse i might get


however lose i might seem
it be
always there
tell i something
remind i of the truth

what truth

that you be wrong to doubt we
world
that the idea that drive you
to question you reality be a
lie

how could you know it be a lie

because it be i lie

because you planted the idea in i
mind

because i perform inception on i
own wife then reap the bitter
reward

why

we would become lost in here
living in
a world of infinite possibility
world where we be god
i
realized we needed to escape but
she would locked away she knowledge of
the unreality of this world

i could not make mal understand that
we needed to break free
to die
so
i start to search we world

search for the right place in
she mind


and when i find that place that
secret place where she have shut
away she knowledge year before i
broke it open

i broke into the deep recess of
she mind to give she the simple
little idea

truth that she have once known
but have chosen to forget

that she world be not real



that death be a necessary escape

you be waiting for a train
train
that will take you far away
you
know where you hope this train will
take you but you can not know for
sure
yet it do not matter

because you will be together


i never think that the idea i would
planted would grow in she mind like
a cancer
that even after we wake

you would continue to believe that you
world be not real

that death be the only escape

you killed i

i be trying to save youI be sorry

you infect i mind
you betrayed
i
but you can make amends
you
can still keep you promise
