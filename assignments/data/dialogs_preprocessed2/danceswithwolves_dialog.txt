poor condition

myself cleanup duty begin
tomorrow
supply abundant
the
country be everything i dream it
would be
there can be no place like
this on earth

damn
damn

only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see

maybe there be more than one

we have no rifle
white man be
sure to have rifle

we should forget this and go home

then go
i for one will not debate
the merit of a single line of smoke
in i own country

he will not quit until we be all
dead



no sign of captain Cargills command
i do not know what to do
communication
can only take place if i leave and i
do not want to abandon i post



make a short patrol yesterday p
m
discovered nothing
will go far
tomorrow



there be a wolf who seem intent on
the going on here
he do not seem
incline to be a nuisance however
and aside from cisco have be i
only company
he have appear each
afternoon for the past two day
he
have milky white sock on both foot
if he come calling tomorrow i will
name he two sock



almost a month and no one have come
the longer this condition persist
the less incline i be to believe
that anyone will
rain have forced i
indoors for most of two day
i have
begin an awning
the work have ruined
i hand but i be excite about the
improvement it will bring to this
place



it be the lonely of time
but
i cannot say that i be unhappy

you there



have make first contact with a wild
indian
one come to the fort and
tried to steal i horse
do not know
how many more be in the vicinity
but i be taking step for another
visitation
be bury excess
ordnance lest it fall into enemy
hand



have make all the preparation i can
think of
i cannot mount an adequate
defense but will try to make a big
impression when they come
wait



the man i encounter be a
magnificent look fellow

kicking bird have be keeping to
himself these last few day
i do
not like to see we medicine man
walking so alone

what do he wife say

he be keeping to himself

that be what she say

make sure that meat be soft
i
tooth hurt

may i come in

no no let he sit with i

we country seem good this summer
but i have not be out to see it

yes
it be good
the grass be rich
the game be plenty and not running
away

i be glad to hear it
but the buffalo
be late
i always worry about the
belly of we child

i be think of a dance

yes a dance be always a good idea
it would be good to have a strong
sign

yes

there be a funny thing about sign
they be always flying in we face
we know when they be bad or good
but sometimes they be strange and
there be no way to understand they
sometimes they make people crazy but
a smart man will take such a sign
into himself and let it run around
for two or three day
if he be still
confuse he will tell somebody
he
might come to you or to i and tell
it
smart man always do that

i have see such a sign

oh

i see a man a white man

just one

just one
he be naked

be you sure it be a man

i see he sex

do you speak to he

no

we will council on this

he might be a god or he might be a
special chief that be why we be
think of have a talk with he

i do not care for this talk about a
white man
whatever kind of white
man he be he be not sioux and that
make he less
we have camp here
for ten day now and each day we
scout find nothing
one old bull
with wolf tearing he apart nothing
more
we need meat not talk

you be right we need meat today
and tomorrow
but we must also have
meat in ten year

but the white be coming
we friend
the shoshone and the Kiowa even we
enemy agree on this the white
be coming
more than can be count

kicking bird be always looking ahead
and that be good
but when i hear
that more white be coming more
than can be count i want to laugh
we take a hundred horse from these
people there be no honor in it
they do not ride well they do not
shoot well they be dirty
they have
no woman no child
they could
not even make it through one winter
in we country
and these people be
said to flourish
i think they will
all be dead in ten year

i think this white man be probably
lost

wind in he hair have spoken straight
he word be strong and i have hear
they
it be true the white be a
poor race and it be hard to understand
they
but when i see one white man
alone without fear in we country
i do not think he be lost
i think
he may have medicine
i see someone
who might speak for all the white
people who be coming
i think this
be a person with which treaty might
be strike

this white man cannot cover we
lodge or string we bow or feed
we child
i will take some good
man
there be many here tonight
we will ride to the soldier fort we
will shoot some arrow into this
white man
if he truly have medicine
he will not be hurt
if he have no
medicine he will be dead

it be easy to become confuse by
these question
it be hard to know
what to do
no man can tell another
how he will be
but i know this
killing a white man be a delicate
matter
if you kill one more be
sure to come
we should talk about
this some more

what be the matter now

otter do not want to go

if we take the horse of a white god
they will make up song about we

maybe

they will ask we to go on raid

who get the white god horse

i do
but we share
you and worm
can ride he too
who can say this
be not a great plan

let i take he otter

i have he

what happen

i do not know
i arm do not work

you should not have fallen down
now we will get in trouble

it be you idea

i idea be only to take the horse

otter hurt himself

you be not hurt
i be hurt

i will be when i father find out
he bow will be across i back

i be wind in he hair
do you not
see that i be not afraid of you
do you see

the party that go against the pawnee
be coming in

there be many heart on the ground



i realize now that i have be wrong
all this time i have be waiting
wait for what
for someone to
find i
for indian to take i horse
to see a buffalo



since i arrive at this post i have
be walking on egg
it have become
a bad habit and i be sick of it
tomorrow morning i will ride out to
the indian
i do not know the outcome
or the wisdom of this think
but
i have become a target and a target
make a poor impression
i be through
waiting

wait

wait
you be hurt

let i help you

you be hurt
you need help

do not

she be hurt

you be not welcome here

go away from we

go away from we
go now

the soldier do not come to fight
he be going away and we will let
he

i be in agreement with kicking bird
we will go down and talk to the white
man and find out what kind of white
man he be

if this council decide to talk with
the man at the soldier fort then it
will be so
but in i mind it be not
right that a sioux chief a chief as
great as ten bear go to ask the
business of a puny trespass white
man
a white soldier who have only
a smart horse and a few white man
clothes

i will not go
you will go
you
and kicking bird
that be all i have
to say

welcome
come
please
sit down

would you like some coffee
coffee

be the coffee not good
too strong
maybe

foundation for good relation be
be laid



they have come again as always the
same two with an escort of six

have you see any buffalo



i believe i be dealing with Kiowa
indian as i have hear that word on
several occasion

head hand horse fire coffee

i be afraid of the man at the fort

he be only one man

i be afraid that he will tell some
white that i be here
i be afraid
that they will try to take i away

every warrior in camp would fight
they if they tried

i cannot make the white man talk
loo ten tant do not know sioux

you have a certain medicine which no
other sioux man or woman have
