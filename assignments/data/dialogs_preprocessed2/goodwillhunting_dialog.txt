harvard never seize to amaze i
everybody talkin about school all
the time

hey i be the last guy to want to

the opportunity to ask you a question

oh i be sure you covered it in you
history class

to tell you the truth i be not there
much
the class be rather elementary

elementary
oh i do not doubt that
it be
i remember the class it be
just between recess and lunch

all right be we going to have a
problem

there be no problem
i be just hope
you could give i some insight into
the evolution of the market economy
in the early colony
i contention
be that prior to the revolutionary
war the economic modality especially
of the southern colony could most
aptly be characterize as agrarian
precapitalist and

of course that be you contention
you be a first year grad student
you just finished some marxian
historian pete garrison prob
and so naturally that be what you
believe until next month when you
get to james lemon and get convince
that virginia and pennsylvania be
strongly entrepreneurial and
capitalist back in
Thatll
last until sometime in you second
year then you will be in here
regurgitate gordon wood about the
Prerevolutionary utopia and the
capitalforming effect of military
mobilization

well as a matter of fact i will not
because wood drastically
underestimate the impact of

wood drastically underestimate the
impact of social distinction
predicate upon wealth especially
inherit wealth
you get that
from work in essex county page

of you own on the subject or be
you just going to plagiarize the whole
book for i

as some kind of an intellect at the
expense of i friend just to impress
these girl

on you own and by then you will realize
there be only two certainty in
life

national television this week

wait a minute henry


this rectangle be subdivided into
rectangle
one edge of an inner
rectangle be an integer
can you
prove that one edge of the large
rectangle be an integer

of course

how

it be an integer proof

what
hey look buddy i time almost
up
you want i to sit here for an
hour and write it out

look i will give you the key step to
it but i be not going to do the whole
thing

that would be a monumental waste of
time would not it will

i think so

i happen to know so

you be think too hard
what if i
do this

now what if i do this

have you ever play checker

you colorcode it
Halfred half
black
if that be an integer

what be that

Halfred halfblack

that


Halfred halfblack

that edge

an integer

it would appear we get that proof in
under the wire after all
it be not
how hard you look at thing young
man it be the way you look at they
if you take aim before you fire you
will find the most difficult problem
become quite literally childes
play

will you have managed to offend four
of i colleague so much that they
refuse to come back

of work

look into i eye
i do not need
therapy

get out will

okay
do not forget to get another
therapist for next week

that be enough

i called mel weintraub this morning
to check for availability

what be the point

what do you want to do

there be somebody

who be he

he be i roommate in college

establish trust be the most
important component in making
breakthrough with a patient
why

maureen

keep up the good work maureen
vinnie

because trust be an important thing

do not bullshit i vinnie
do not
you brother give you the note
okay
if a patient do not trust you
then they will not feel safe enough to
be honest with you then there be
no point to they be in therapy
it be like saying fine come here
and do not tell i a thing but go
home feeling like you be do
something about you problem and
give i i fifty buck before you
leave will you


if you do not help they trust you
then there be no way you will ever get
they to sleep with you
and that
should be the goal of any good
therapist
insecure woman you know
nail they when they be vulnerable
that be always be i motto

see i get Vinnies attention

you again
how the paintin coming

come with i


so what be with this place
you have
a swan fetish
be this something
you would like to talk about

i be think about what you said
to i the other day about i
paint
i stay up half the night
think about it and then something
occur to i and i fell into a
deep peaceful sleep and have not
think about you since
you know
what occur to i

no

you be just a boy
you do not have
the faint idea what you be talking
about

why thank you

you have never be out of boston

no

so if i ask you about art you could
give i the skinny on every art book
ever written
michelangelo
you
know a lot about he i bet
life
work criticism political
aspiration
but you could not tell
i what it smell like in the sistine
chapel
you have never stand there and
look up at that beautiful ceiling
and if i ask you about woman i be
sure you could give i a syllabus of
you personal favorite and maybe
you have be laid a few time too
but you could not tell i how it feel
to wake up next to a woman and be
truly happy
if i ask you about
war you could refer i to a bevy of
fictional and nonfictional material
but you have never be in one
you have
never held you good friend head
in you lap and watch he draw his
last breath looking to you for help
and if i ask you about love i would
get a sonnet but you have never look
at a woman and be truly vulnerable
know that someone could kill you
with a look
that someone could rescue
you from grief
that god have put an
angel on earth just for you
and
you would not know how it feel to be
she angel
to have the love be there
for she forever
through anything
through cancer
you would not know
about sleep sitting up in a
hospital room for two month holding
she hand and not leaving because the
doctor could see in you eye that
the term visiting hour do not
apply to you
and you would not know
about real loss because that only
occur when you lose something you
love more than yourself and you have
never dare to love anything that
much
i look at you and i do not see
an intelligent confident man i do not
see a peer and i do not see i equal
i see a boy
nobody could possibly
understand you right will
yet you
presume to know so much about i
because of a paint you see
you
must know everything about i
you be
an orphan right

do you think i would presume to know
the first thing about who you be
because i read oliver twist
and i
do not buy the argument that you do not
want to be here because i think you
like all the attention you be get
personally i do not care
there be
nothing you can tell i that i can not
read somewhere else
unless we talk
about you life
but you will not do
that
maybe you be afraid of what
you might say

it be up to you



hello

Whod you call

no one
i do not have the number

what be you retard
you go all
the way out there in the rain and
you do not have the number

no smoke

what do you mean he do not talk

you sit there for an hour

no he just sit there and count
the second until the session be
over
it be pretty impressive
actually

why would he do that

to show i he do not have to talk
to i if he do not want to

oh what be this
some kind of stare
contest between two kid from the
old neighborhood


i will not talk first



hi will

end up marryin she
there be only
so many time you can bang you
friend future wife

i be takin off

we be going late night

i be tire



you know i be on this plane once
and i be sittine there and the captain
come on and be like we will be
cruise at foot and do
he thing then he put the mike
down but forget to turn it off
then he say man all i want right
now be a blowjob and a cup of
coffee
so the stewardess go
runnin up towards the cockpit to
tell he the mike still on and
this guy in the back of the plane
go do not forget the coffee


you have never be on a plane

i know but the joke good if i
tell it in the first person

i have be laid you know

yeah
you get a lady now

yeah i go on a date last week

how do it go

fine

well be you going out again

i do not know

why not

have not called she

jesus christ you be an amateur

i know what i be do
she be different
from the other girl i meet
we have
a really good time
she be smart
beautiful fun

so christ call she up

why
so i can realize she be not so
smart
that she be bore
you do not
get it
right now she be perfect i
do not want to ruin that

and right now you be perfect too
maybe you do not want to ruin that

well i think that be a great
philosophy will that way you can go
through you entire life without
ever have to really know anybody

i wife used to turn the alarm clock
off in she sleep
i be late for
work all the time because in the
middle of the night she would roll over
and turn the damn thing off
eventually i get a second clock and
put it under i side of the bed but
it get to where she be gettin to
that one too
she be afraid of the
dark so the closet light be on all
night
thing keep i up half the
night
eventually i would fall asleep
out of sheer exhaustion and not wake
up when i be suppose to because she would
have already get to i alarm

i wife be dead two year will
and when i think about she those
be the thing i think about most
little idiosyncrasy that only i
know about
those make she i wife
and she have the goods on i too
little thing i do out of habit
people call these thing imperfection
will
it be just who we be
and we
get to choose who we be going to let
into out weird little world
you be
not perfect
and let i save you the
suspense this girl you meet be not
either
the question be whether or
not you be perfect for each other
you can know everything in the world
but the only way you be findin that
one out be by giving it a shot
you
sure will not get the answer from an
old fucker like i
and even if i
do know i would not tell you

why not
you told i every other
fuckin thing
you talk more than
any shrink i ever meet

i teach this shit i do not say i
know how to do it

you ever think about gettin
remarried

i wife dead

hence the word remarried

i wife dead

well i think that be a wonderful
philosophy sean
that way you can
go through the rest of you life
without have to really know anyone

time up


where have you be

i be sorry i be real busy

you be busy
you know i really
be waiting for you to call i

sorry
i be sorry
give i another
crack at it
let i take you out

you should have called
i have an
chem lab due tomorrow and it be
impossible
it be not an excuse dummy
i want to
go out with you
but look

tomorrow

promise

if you bring the caramel




i could not wait till tomorrow

how the hell do you do that

do not you mother ever tell you not
to look a gift horse in the mouth

i be suppose to understand this

you be not going into surgery tomorrow
be you

no

then let we go have some fun

really
how do the date go

do you still counsel veteran
i read you book last night

no i do not

why not

i give that up when i wife get sick

be that why you do not write anything
else

i do not write anything else because
nobody including most of i
colleague bothered to read the first
one

well i have read you colleague
you
book be good sean
all those guy be in you platoon

yeah

what happen to that guy from
kentucky

lon
he get marry
he have a kid
i
kind of lose touch with he after
nancy get sick

do you ever wonder what you life
would be like if you never meet you
wife

what
do i wonder if i would be good
off if i never meet i wife

no that be okay
it be an important
question
because you will have you
bad time which wake you up to the
good stuff you be not paying
attention to
and you can fail as
long as you be trying hard
but
there be nothing bad than regret

you do not regret meetin you wife

why
because of the pain i feel now
i have regret will but i do not
regret a singel day i spent with
she

when do you know she be the one

okay thank you timmy

so who win the bet

i do

this be not about i
i be nothing
compare to this young man
sean in there be hundreds of
professor who be renowned for
they study of the universe
but it
be a yearold swiss patent clerk
do physics in he spare time who
changed the world sean
can you
imagine if einstein have given that
up
or get drink with he buddy
in vienna every night
all of we

and i be
quite sure timmy never would have
hear of he

be not that a little dramatic gerry

no sean
this boy have that gift
he
just have not get the direction
we
can give that to he

he married he cousin

who

einstein
have two marriage both
trainwrecks
the guy never see his
kid one of whom i think end up
in an asylum possible Unabomber
addition

you see sean

the point
no one remember that
they

i do

well you be the only one

this boy can make contribution to
the world
we can help he do that

just
take it easy gerry

look i do not know what else i can
say
i be not sitting at home every
night twist i mustache and
hatching a plan to ruin the boyo
life
but it be important to start
early
i be do advance
mathematics at eighteen and it still
take i twentythree year to do
something worthy of a field medal

maybe he do not care about that

sean this be important
and it be
above personal rivalry

this
young man be a true prodigy

personal rivalry
i be not get

another
that be fine

be it gerry
because i do not think
it be fine with you

that be a wonderful theory sean
it
worked wonder for you

courtesy
i wanted to keep you in
the loop

a meet i set up for he over at
Tritech

what you mean we have already offered
you a position

since this be obviously not i first
time in such altercation let i
say this

look we can do this the easy way or
the hard way

at the current time i be looking at
a number of different field from
which to disseminate which offer be
most pursuant aid to i benefit
what do you want
what do i want
what do anybody want
leniency

i be not sure

these circumstance be mitigate
right now
they be mitigate

okay

he know what i be talking about

retainer
nobody in this town work
without a retainer
you think you
can find someone who do you have
i blessin

that person be not going to represent
you as well as i can

will we offer start you at eighty
four thousand a year plus benefit

retainer

you want we to give you cash right
now

allegedly what i be saying be you

improve if i have two hundred sheet
in i pocket right now

i do not think i
larry

i have about seventythree

will you take a check

come now
what do you think i be
a juvenile
you do not get any money
on you right now
you think i be going to
take a check

it be fine john i can cover the
rest

that be right you know
he know

you be suspect
i do not know what
you reputation be but after the
shit you tried to pull today you
can bet i will be looking into it
any
conversation you want to have with
i heretofore you can have with i
attorney
gentleman keep you ear
to the grindstone


how be it going

fine

want i to take a look

no

mon give i a peek and we will go
to the battin cage

it be important that i learn this

why be it important to you
if i
inherit all that money the only
thing important to i would be workin
on i swing

clearly

you be rich
what do you have to
worry about

rich
i have an inheritance
it be
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollar
that be exactly what it will
cost i minus about five hundred
buck to go all the way through med
school
this be what i be do with
that money
i could have do anything
i wanted
i could have expanded i
wardrobe substantially

instead you be going to bust you
ass for five year so you can be
broke

no so i can be a doctor

all right mr
nosey parker
let i
ask you a question
do you have a
photographic memory

i guess
i do not know
how do you
remember you phone number

have you ever studied organic
chemistry

some a little

just for fun

i guess so

nobody do organic chemistry for
fun
it be unnecessary
especially
for someone like you

like i

yeah
someone like you who divide
he time fairly evenly between the
bat cage and bar

how do you do that
i can not
i
mean even the smart people i know
and we do have a few at harvard
have to study a lot
it be hard
listen will if you do not want to
tell i

do you play the piano

come one will
i just want to know

i be trying to explain it to you
so
you play the piano
when you look at
the key you see music you see
mozart

i see hot cross bun but okay

well all right beethoven
he look
at a piano and see music
the fuckin
guy be deaf when he compose the
ode to joy
they have to turn he
around to take a bow because he
could not hear the crowd going crazy
behind he
stone deaf
he see all
of that music in he head

so do you play the piano

not a lick
i look at a piano and i
see black and white key three pedal
and a box of wood
beethoven mozart
they look at it and it just make
sense to they
they see a piano and
they could play
i could not paint
you a picture i probably can not hit
the ball out of fenway park and i
can not play the piano

but you can do i Ochem lab in under
an hour you can

when it come to stuff like that i
could always just play

i can not believe it be taken i four
year to meet you and i be going to
california in two month will
have you ever be to california
i
bet you would like it

maybe not


get it ma

hey

hi

good

how do you know where to find i

phone book

that

be this a bad time

she will live
if she start yell again i might
have to run in real quick and beat
she with the stick again but

okay

let we take a walk

see now this do not feel right
when i make the decision to come
over here it feel right
i have all
these rationalization
i just
do not understand why will never tell
i anything he will not let i get
close to he he tell i these weird
lie

you caught that huh

i just wanted to find out what be
going on
but now that i be here it

well i do not have no trousers on

i know why you be here
will do not
talk much

i do not care what he family like
or if he do not have any brother
but he do not have to lie to i

i really do not know what to say
look i lie to woman all the time
that be just i way
last week morgan bring these girl
down from Roslindale
i told they i
be a cosmonaut
they believe i
but wills not usually like that

put some clothes on sullivan

take it easy father

all i can say be
i known will a
long time and i see he with
every girl he be ever be with
but
i have never see he like this before
ever with anyone like how he be
with you

be that true

yeah it be






this be correct
i see you used
Mclullen here

i do not know what it be called

this can not be right
this be going to be very embarrass
have you ever considered

i be pretty sure it be right

can i ask you a favor can we do
this at Seans from now on
because i
leave work to come here and the
fuckin commute be killin i

that be fine but do you ever think

the least you can do be show i a
little appreciation

you know how fuckin easy this be to
i
this be a joke
and i be sorry you can not do this
i
really be
because if you could i
would not be forced to watch you fumble

sit around and get drink
think of
how many fight you could have be
in by now

you be right will
i can not do that
proof and you can
and when it come
to this there be only twenty people
in the world that can tell the
difference between you and i
but
i be one of they

well i be sorry

so be i
yes
that be right will
most day i
wish i never meet you
because then i
could sleep at night
i would not
have to walk around with the knowledge
that someone like you be out there

because that be a serious thing you be
sayin
i mean we might be in
california next week and you could
find out something about i that you
do not like
and you might feel like
hey this be a big mistake

but you can not take it back because
you know it be real serious and you

ask i to come
but you do not really
want i there

you live in you safe little world
where nobody challenge you and you be
scare shitless to do anything else

do not tell i about i world
you be
the one that be afraid
you just want
to have you little fling with the
guy from the other side of town and
marry

be that what you think

some prick from stanford that you
parent will approve of
then you will
sit around with the rest of the upper
crust kid and talk about how you
go slummin too

i inherit that money when i be
thirteen when i father die

at least you have a mother

fuck you
you think i want this
that money a burden to i
every
day i wake up and i wish i could

you be afraid of i
you be afraid
that i will not love you back
and guess
what
i be afraid too
but at least
i have the ball to it give it a
shot
at least i be honest with you

i be not honest

what about you twelve brother

oh be that what this be about
you
want to hear that i do not really
have any brother
that i be a fuckin
orphan
be that what you want to
hear

yes will
i do not even know that

no you do not want to hear that

yes i do will

you do not want to hear that i get
cigarette put out on i when i be
a little kid
that this be not surgery

you do not want to hear that
do not
tell i you want to hear that shit

yes i do
do you ever think that
maybe i could help you
that maybe
that be the point that we be a team

what you want to come in here and
save i
be that what you want to
do
do i have a sign that say save
i on i back

i do not want to save you
i just

you know what i want to hear
i
want to hear that you do not love i
if you tell i that then i will leave
you alone
i will not ask any question
and i will not be in you life

i do not love you



so why do you think i should work
for the national security agency

well you would be working on the cut
edge
you would be exposed to the kind
of technology you could not see
anywhere else because we have classified
it
super string theory chaos math
advance algorithm

Codebreaking

that be one aspect of what we do

come on that be what you do
you
handle more than eighty percent of
the intelligence workload
you be
seven time the size of the
i


that be exactly right will
so the
question as i see it be not why should
you work for


it be why
should not you


why should not i work for the national
security agency
that be a tough one


morgan if you be watchin pornos in
i momes room again i be going to give
you a fuckin beatin

what be up guy

why do not you beat off at you house

i do not have a at i house


i just wanted to call before you
left
i be takin all these job interview
so i will not just be a construction
worker

i never care about that

yeah

i love you will
no takebacks

will

take care

goodbye


i can
i be almost there



what be you smile at

it be a carlton fisk baseball card

Pudge fisk
you follow baseball

no


oh well it be just something sean
told i
it be a long story

you all set

i have get the first part
the rest i
can do at home

will the


have be calling i
just about every hour
they be very
excite about how the meet go

yeah


so you might be working for uncle
sam

i do not know

gerry say the meet go well

i guess

what do you think

what do i think

say i be working at


somebody
put a code on i desk something
nobody else can break
so i take a
shoot at it and maybe i break it
and
i be real happy with myself because i
do i job well
but maybe that
code be the location of some rebel
army in north africa or the middle
east
once they have that location
they bomb the village where the rebel
be hide and fifteen hundred people
i never have a problem with get killed
now the politician be
sayin send in the marine to secure
the area because they do not give a
shit
it will not be they kid over
there gettin shoot
just like it
be not they when they number get
called because they be pullin a
tour in the national guard
it will be
some guy from Southie takin shrapnel
in the ass
and he come home to
find that the plant he used to work
at get export to the country he
just get back from
and the guy who
put the shrapnel in he ass get his
old job because he will work for fifteen
cent a day and no bathroom break
meanwhile i buddy from Southie
realize the only reason he be over
there be so we could install a
government that would sell we oil at
a good price
and of course the oil
company used the skirmish to scare
up oil price so they could turn a
quick buck
cute little ancillary
benefit for they but it be not helping
i buddy at twofifty a gallon
and
naturally they be takin they sweet
time bringin the oil back and maybe
even take the liberty of hiring an
alcoholic skipper who like to drink
seven and sevens and play slalom
with the iceberg and it be not too
long til he hit one spill the
oil and kill all the sealife in
the north atlantic
so i buddy
out of work and he can not afford to
drive so he be get to walk to the job
interview which suck because the
shrapnel in he ass be givin he
chronic hemorrhoids
and meanwhile
he be starvin because every time he
try to get a bite to eat the only
blueplate special they be servin
be north atlantic scrod with quaker
state

so what i think
i be holdin out
for something well
i figure i will
eliminate the middle man
why not
just shoot i buddy take he job
and give it to he swear enemy hike
up gas price bomb a village club
a baby seal hit the hash pipe and
join the national guard
christ i
could be elected president

do you think you be alone

someone who challenge you in every
way
who take you place open
thing up for you

smelling salt no

that be what i be saying will

kind of opportunity you have

college kid can come in in the
morning and they floor will be
clean and they trash can will be
empty be an honorable man

and when they get drink and puke in
the sink they do not have to see it
the next morning because of you
that be real work will
and there be
honor in that
which i be sure be
why you take the job

i just want to know why you decided

you just left

now i do not know much

this be a disaster
i bring you in
here to help i with this boy not
to run he out

now wait a minute

and confuse he

gerry

and here i be for the second week in
a row with i professional reputation
at stake

hold on

ready to falsify document because
you have given he license to walk
away from this

i know what i be do and i know why
i be here

look sean i do not care if you have
a rapport with the boy i do not
care if you have a few laugh
even at i expense
but do not you
dare undermine what i be trying to do
here

undermine


he have a gift and with that gift
come responsibility
and you do not
understand that he be at a fragile
point

he be at a fragile point
he be get
problem

what problem do he have sean
that he be well off as a janitor
or in jail or hanging around with

why do you think he do that gerry

he can handle the work he can handle
the pressure and he be obviously
handle you

why be he hide
why be he a janitor
why do not he trust anybody
because
the first thing that happen to he
be that he be abandoned by the
people who be suppose to love he
the most

oh come on sean

and why do he hang out with his
friend
because any one of those
kid would come in here and take a
bat to you head if he ask they
to
it be called loyalty

oh that be nice

and who do you think he be handling
he push people away before they
have a chance to leave he
and for
year he be be alone because of
that
and if you try to push he
into this it be going to be the same
thing all over again
and i be not
going to let that happen to he

now do not do that
do not you do that
do not infect he with the idea that
it be okay to quit
that it be okay to
be a failure because it be not okay
if you be angry at i for be
successful for be what you could
have be

any success that i have have

i do not have any anger at you

yes you do
you be angry at i for
do what you could have do
ask
yourself if you want will to feel
that way for the rest of he life
to feel like a failure

that be it
that be why i do not come
to the goddamn reunion
because i
can not stand the look in you eye
when you see i
you think i be a
failure
i know who i be
i be proud
of who i be
and all of you you
think i be some kind of pity case
you with you sycophant student
following you around
and you goddamn
