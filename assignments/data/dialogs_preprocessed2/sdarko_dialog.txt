child
when do you brother
stop

when he die

inconsiderate

well

thanks

so
what be you going to do

i do not know yet

do you believe that everything
happen for a reason

i know that for every action
there be an equal and opposite
reaction

yeah
i learned that in science

and everything in the universe be
in constant motion as the universe
be constantly expand

yeah but do you believe that
everything happen for a reason
like in life

you mean like destiny


i think everyone have a purpose
something they be mean to do
like
potential but more clearcut
for
instance i be destine to get i
hand on the meteorite

really

i be making amazing discovery
every day practically sleeping at
the lab

i be still do some test but
there be a metallic substance that be
not showing up on the elemental


what happen to you arm

it be just a rash

sam wait

it be no big
deal

the rest be locked away somewhere
else
somewhere safe
everyone
going to want a piece of this thing
pretty soon


you ever see one of these

no

it be a scan electron
microscope
it use electron
instead of light to scan the image

at first i think it be a
siderite but then i see it be
more than that
much more
it do
have a percentage of nickel and
iron in it as i first suspected
but it also have something else

and what be that

an unrecognizable element
i have
do all the test
it do not
exist on the periodic table

so this be pretty major

this be history
i be think of
calling it framium

Framium

for i last name
frame


what if it be like
proof of some
alien lifeform from another galaxy
or something

it be very important you promise i
you will not tell anyone else what
i have show you
i have to wait
till just the right moment

or some secret government
organization could come in here and
take it away from i

and then later on year from now
take credit for the discovery
themselves

i will not say anything

good

like

some of the most profound mystery
of the universe

travel

time travel

it be more like one scenario or one
type of scenario
i do not
completely understand it
