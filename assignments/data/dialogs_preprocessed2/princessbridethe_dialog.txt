five year later the main square
of florin city be filled as
never before to hear the
announcement of the great prince
Humperdincks brideto be


raise he hand
start to speak
i people
a month from now
we country will have it th
anniversary
on that sundown i
shall marry a lady who be once a
commoner like yourselves
but perhaps you will not find
she common now
would you like to
meet she




i people
the princess
buttercup



buttercup emptiness consume
she
although the law of the land
give humperdinck the right to
choose he bride she do not
love he


despite Humperdincks reassurance
that she would grow to love he
the only joy she find be in she
daily ride


word i lady


we be but poor lose circus
performer
be there a village
nearby

there be nothing nearby
not for
mile

then there will be no one to hear
you scream



what be that you be ripping

it be fabric from the uniform of
an army officer of guilder

who be guilder

the country across the sea
the
swear enemy of florin
go

once the horse reach the
castle the fabric will make the
prince suspect the Guilderians
have abducted he love
when he
find she body dead on the
guilder frontier he suspicion
will be totally confirmed

you never said anything about
killing anyone

i have hired you to help i start a
war
that be a prestigious line of
work with a long and glorious
tradition

i just do not think it be right
killing an innocent girl

be i going mad or do the word
think escape you lip
you
be not hired for you brain
you hippopotamic land mass

i agree with Fezzik


we only think he
be in a fury now
he be really get mad
oh
the sot have spoken
what
happen to she be not truly you
concern i will kill she
and remember this never forget
this


when i find you you be so
slobber drink you could not buy
brandy
now to Fezzik who
retreat as much as he
can while vizzini advance
and you friendless
brainless helpless hopeless
do you want i to send you back
to where you be unemployed in
greenland

that vizzini he can fuss
a slight emphasis on
the last word

fuss
fuss
suddenly he be get it
again emphasis on the
last word

i think he like to scream at we

probably he mean no harm

he be really very short on charm

oh you have a great gift for rhyme

yes some of the time

enough of that

be there rock ahead

if there be we will all be dead

no more rhyme now i mean it

anybody want a peanut


we will reach the cliff by dawn

why be you do that

making sure nobody following we

that would be inconceivable

despite what you think you will
be catch
and when you be the
prince will see you all hang

of all the neck on this boat
highness the one you should be
worrying about be you own

stop do that
we can all
relax it be almost over

you be sure nobody following we

as i told you it would be
absolutely totally and in all
other way inconceivable
no one
in guilder know what we have do
and no one in florin could have
get here so fast
out of
curiosity why do you ask

no reason
it be only i just
happen to look behind we and
something be there

what





explaining with as
much logic as he can muster
probably some local fisherman out
for a pleasure cruise at night
through eelinfested water



go in get after she

i do not swim

i only dog paddle

veer left
left
left



do you know what that sound be
highness
those be the shriek
eel if you doubt i just
wait
they always grow loud
when they be about to feed on
human flesh



if you swim back now i promise
no harm will come to you
i doubt
you will get such an offer from
the eel


she do not get eat by the eel
at this time


what

the eel do not get she
i be
explaining to you because you
look nervous

well i be not nervous

well maybe i be a little bit
concern
but that be not the
same thing

because i can stop now if you want

no
you could read a little bit
more
if you want

do you know what that sound be
highness



those be the shriek eel

we be past that grandpa


you read it already

oh
oh i goodness i do
i be
sorry
beg you pardon


all right all right let we see
uh she be in the water the eel
be coming after she
she be
frighten
the eel start to
charge she
and then


put she down
just put she down


i think he be get close

he be no concern of ours
sail on
i suppose you think you be brave
do not you

only compare to some


look
he be right on top of we
i
wonder if he be use the same
wind we be use

whoever he be he be too late
see
the cliff of insanity




hurry up
move the thing
um
that other thing
move it
we be safe only be
strong enough to go up we way
he will have to sail around for
hour til he find a harbor









he be climbing the rope
and he be
gain on we

inconceivable




fast

i think i be going fast

you be suppose to be this
colossus
you be this great
legendary thing
and yet he gain

well i be carrying three people
and he be get only himself

i do not accept excuse
i be just going to have to find
myself a new giant that be all

do not say that vizzini
please




do i make it clear that you job
be at stake







he have very good arm



he do not fall
inconceivable

you keep use that word i do
not think it mean what you think
it mean
i god
he be climbing



whoever he be he be obviously
see we with the princess and
must therefore die
you carry she
we will head straight for the
guilder frontier
catch up when
he be dead
if he fall fine
if
not the sword

i want to duel he lefthanded

you know what a hurry we be in

well it be the only way i can be
satisfy
if i use i right
tch over too quickly

turn abruptly
start offscreen
oh have it you way



you be careful
people in mask cannot be
trust

i be waiting




hello there

slow going

look i do not mean to be rude
but this be not as easy as it
look
so i would appreciate it if
you would not distract i

sorry

thank you

i do not suppose you could speed
thing up

if you be in such a hurry you
could lower a rope or a tree
branch or find something useful
to do

i could do that
in fact i have
get some rope up here
but i do
not think that you will accept i
help since i be only waiting
around to kill you

that do put a damper on we
relationship

but i promise i will not kill you
until you reach the top

that be very comfort
but i be
afraid you will just have to wait

i hate waiting
i could give you
i word as a spaniard

no good
i have known too many
spaniard

you do not know any way you will
trust i

nothing come to mind

i swear on the soul of i father
domingo montoya you will reach
the top alive


throw i the rope








thank you

we will wait until you be ready

again
thank you

i do not mean to pry but you
do not by any chance happen to
have six finger on you right
hand

do you always begin conversation
this way

i father be slaughter by a
sixfingered man
he be a great
swordmaker i father
and when
the sixfingered man appear and
requested a special sword i
father take the job
he slave a
year before he be do

i have never see it equal


the sixfingered man return and
demanded it but at onetenth he
promise price
i father refused
without a word the sixfingered
man slash he through the heart
i loved i father so naturally
challenged he murderer to a duel
i failed

the sixfingered man do leave i
alive with the sixfingered
sword but he give i these


how old be you

i be eleven year old
when i
be strong enough i dedicated i
life to the study of fence
so
the next time we meet i will not
fail
i will go up to the
sixfingered man and say hello
i name be inigo montoya
you
killed i father
prepare to die


you have do nothing but study
swordplay

more pursuit than study lately
you see i cannot find he
it be
be twenty year now
i be
starting to lose confidence
i
just work for vizzini to pay the
bill
there be not a lot of money
in revenge

hand back the
great sword start
to rise
well i certainly hope you find
he someday

you be ready then

whether i be or not you have be
more than fair

you seem a decent fellow
i hate
to kill you

walking away a few
pace unsheathing he sword
you seem a decent fellow
i hate
to die

begin




you be use Bonettis defense
against i ah

i think it fitting considering
the rocky terrain

naturally you must expect i to
attack with capo ferro

naturally
but i find Thibault cancel out
capo ferro do not you

unless the enemy have studied his
agrippa

which i have


you be wonderful

thank you i have work hard to
become so

i admit it you be good than
i be

then why be you smile

because i know something you
do not know

and what be that

i be not lefthanded




you be amazing

i ought to be after twenty year

there be something i ought to tell
you

tell i

i be not lefthanded either




who be you

no one of consequence

i must know

get used to disappointment

okay








kill i quickly

i would as soon destroy a stain
glass window as an artist like
yourself
however since i can not
have you following i either

please understand i hold you in
the high respect


inconceivable

give she to i
grab buttercup
start off
catch up with we quickly

what do i do

finish he finish he
you way

oh good i way
thank you
vizzini
which way be i way


pick up one of those rock get
behind the boulder and in a few
minute the man in black will
come running around the bend
the
minute he head be in view hit
it with the rock

little frown
softly
i way not very sportsmanlike



i do that on purpose
i do not
have to miss

i believe you so what happen
now

we face each other as god intended
sportsmanlike
no trick no
weapon skill against skill alone

you mean you will put down you
rock and i will put down i sword
and we will try to kill each other
like civilized people

i could kill you now

frankly i think the odds be
slightly in you favor at hand
fight

it be not i fault be the
big and the strong
i
do not even exercise


look be you just fiddling around
with i or what

i just want you to feel you be
do well
i hate for people to
die embarrass


you be quick

and a good thing too

get set for
another onslaught
why do you wear a mask
be you
burned by acid or something like
that

oh no
it be just that they be
terribly comfortable
i think
everyone will be wearing they in
the future

standing talking as
he do so
i just figure out why you give
i so much trouble



he arm never leave
Fezziks throat
why be that do you think

he voice just
beginning to get a
little strain
well i have not fight just one
person for so long
i have be
specialize in group
battling
gang for local charity that
kind of thing



why should that make such a
difference

well
and now he voice be
definitely growing weak
you see you use different
move when you be fighting half a
dozen people than when you only
have to be worried about one




i do not envy you the headache you
will have when you awake
but in
the meantime rest well
and
dream of large woman


there be a mighty duel it
range all over
they be both
master

who win
how do it end

looking down in the
position where inigo
fell unconscious
the loser run off alone
point in the
direction vizzini and
take
the winner follow those
footprint toward guilder

shall we track they both

the loser be nothing
only the
princess matter
clearly this be all planned
by warrior of guilder
we must
be ready for whatever lie ahead

could this be a trap

i always think everything could
be a trap which be why i be
still alive



so it be down to you
and it be
down to i

if you wish she dead by all
means keep moving forward

let i explain

there be nothing to explain
you be trying to kidnap what i have
rightfully stolen

perhaps an arrangement can be
reach

there will be no arrangement
and you be killing she



but if there can be no
arrangement then we be at an
impasse

i be afraid so i can not compete
with you physically
and you be
no match for i brain

you be that smart

let i put it this way
have you
ever hear of plato aristotle
socrates

yes

moron

really
in that case i challenge
you to a battle of wit

for the princess

to the death

i accept

good
then pour the wine

inhale this but do not touch

i smell nothing

what you do not smell be called
iocane powder
it be odorless
tasteless dissolve instantly in
liquid and be among the more
deadly poison known to man

hmm


all right
where be the poison
the battle of wit have begin
it
end when you decide and we both
drink and find out who be right
and who be dead

but it be so simple
all i have to
do be divine from what i know of
you
be you the sort of man who
would put the poison into he own
goblet or he enemy

now a clever man would put the
poison into he own goblet
because he would know that only a
great fool would reach for what
he be given
i be not a great
fool so i can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you
but you
must have known i be not a great
fool
you would have count on
it so i can clearly not choose
the wine in front of i

and now there be a
trace of nervousness begin
you have make you decision then

not remotely
because iocane
come from australia as everyone
know
and australia be entirely
people with criminal
and
criminal be used to have
people not trust they as you be
not trust by i
so i can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of you

truly you have a dizzying
intellect

wait till i get going
where be i

australia

yes australia and you must
have suspected i would have known
the powder origin so i can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of i

you be just stalling now

you would like to think that would not
you
you have beaten i giant which
mean you be exceptionally strong
so you could have put the poison
in you own goblet trusting on
you strength to save you
so i
can clearly not choose the wine
in front of you
but you have also
best i spaniard which mean
you must have studied
and in
study you must have learned
that man be mortal so you would
have put the poison as far from
yourself as possible so i can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of i

you be trying to trick i into
giving away something it will not
work

it have work you have given
everything away i know where
the poison be

then make you choice

i will
and i choose

what in the world can that be


what
where
i do not see anything


oh well could have sworn i
see something
no matter

what be so funny

i will tell you in a minute
first
let we drink i from i glass
and you from yours

you guess wrong

you only think i guess wrong
that be what be so funny
i
switched glass when you back
be turn
you fool



you fell victim to one of the
classic blunder
the most famous
be never get involved in a land
war in asia
but only slightly
less well known be this
never
go in against a sicilian when
death be on the line



who be you

i be no one to be trifle with
that be all you ever need know

a final glance back
toward vizzini
to think all that time it be
you cup that be poisoned

they be both poisoned
i spent
the last few year building up an
immunity to iocane powder


someone have beaten a giant
there will be great suffering in
guilder if she die


he voice harsh now
carrying the promise
of violence
catch you breath

if you will release i
whatever
you ask for ransom
you will get
it i promise you

and what be that worth the
promise of a woman
you be very
funny highness

i be giving you a chance
no
matter where you take i
there be no great hunter than
prince humperdinck
he could
track a falcon on a cloudy day
he can find you

you think you dear love will
save you

i never said he be i dear
love
and yes he will save i
that i know

you admit to i you do not love
you fiance

he know i do not love he

be not capable of love be what
you mean

i have loved more deeply than a
killer like yourself could ever
dream

that be a warn highness
the
next time i hand fly on it
own
for where i come from there
be penalty when a woman lie


Iocane
i would bet i life on it
and there be the Princesss
footprint

or
be an hour ago
if she be
otherwise when i find she i
shall be very put out

explaining as a
teacher might
i can not afford to make exception

nothing but work work work all
the time

you mock i pain

you pig fiance be too late
few more step and we will be
safe in the fire swamp


we will never survive

nonsense you be only saying
that because no one ever have



it be not that bad
i be not saying
i would like to build a summer home
here but the tree be actually
quite lovely


well now that be an adventure

singe a bit be you

she be not and she
shake she head no
you



well one thing i will say
the
fire swamp certainly do keep
you on you toe


this will all soon be but a happy
memory because roberts ship
revenge be anchore at the far
end
and i as you know am
roberts

but how be that possible since
he be be marauding twenty year
and you only left i five year
ago

i myself be often surprise at
life little quirk

you see what i told you before
about saying please be true
it intrigued roberts as do i
description of you beauty


finally roberts decided something
he said all right westley
i have never have a valet
you can
try it for tonight
i will most
likely kill you in the morning

three year he said that
good
night westley
good work
sleep
well
i will most likely kill you
in the morning
it be a fine
time for i
i be learning to
fence to fight anything anyone
would teach i
and roberts and i
eventually become friend
and
then it happen

what
go on

well roberts have grow so rich
he wanted to retire
so he take
i to he cabin and told i he
secret
i be not the dread
pirate roberts he said
i
name be ryan
i inherit this
ship from the previous dread
pirate roberts just as you will
inherit it from i
the man i
inherit it from be not the
real dread pirate roberts either

he name be cummerbund
the real
roberts have be retired fifteen
year and living like a king in
patagonia
then he explain the
name be the important thing for
inspiring the necessary fear
you
see no one would surrender to
the dread pirate westley

so we sail ashore take on an
entirely new crew and he stay
aboard for awhile as first mate
all the time calling i roberts
once the crew believe he left
the ship and i have be roberts
ever since
except now that
we be together i shall retire
and hand the name over to someone
else
be everything clear to you







we will never succeed we may as
well die here

no
no
we have already succeed


i mean what be the three
terror of the fire swamp
one
the flame spurt
no problem
there be a popping sound precede
each we can avoid that
two the
lightning sand
but you be
clever enough to discover what
that look like so in the future
we can avoid that too

westley what about the

you

s

rodent of unusual size
i do not
think they exist


westley

now be that so terrible


surrender


you mean you wish to surrender to
i
very well i accept

i give you full mark for
bravery do not make yourself a
fool

ah but how will you capture we
we know the secret of the fire
swamp
we can live there quite
happily for some time
so
whenever you feel like dying
feel free to visit

i tell you once again surrender

it will not happen





for the last time

revenge
promise to return he
to he ship

i swear it will be do



once we be out of sight take he
back to florin and throw he in
the pit of despair

must be very brave
but nobody withstand the
machine
