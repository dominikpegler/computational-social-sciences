Rodman like we friend delacroix
but i guarantee you will be send
packing just like he

these be the standing
read they
and weep
as you can plainly see
the continental network system be
languish




look at they people
we be

we be
Doodoo on
a stick if you will

i do not like to be the laugh
stock of the broadcast industry
i
have pride and people you well
start get some too
these
number have to go up

question

so what do you want we to do

what i want everyone to do be write
some material that be
the
junk you have be writing be about
as funny as a dead baby
it be not
funny it be not new
it be not sexy
it it it

suck


thank you fish
this
meet be over but i want everyone
to seriously think about what i
said and how you can deliver

monsieur delacroix in i office now


how be it

why do not you tell i about this
staff meet

nobody told i anything

what good be you if you do not tell
i stuff like this

it be not i fault
if i would
have known i would have known

do you know what

time be



time be colored people time
the stereotypical belief that
negroe be always late
that
negroe have no sense of time
time except when it come to music
or dance

let we sit down over there


i be sorry about i blowup but i
have to have a whip boy every
meet

i understand
but again in all
honesty i be not informed

forget it
i believe you be i
most creative person i have get on
staff
you be hip
you know
what be happening
i get some corny
white boy and girl writing for i

i understand black culture
i grow
up around black people all i life
if the truth be tell i probably
know nigger good than you
monsieur delacroix
please do not
get offended by i use of the
quoteunquote word
i get a
black wife and three biracial
child so i feel i have a right
to use that word
i do not give a
damn what spike say tarantino be
right
nigger be just a word
if
dirty ole bastard can use it every
other word so can i

i would prefer you not use that
word in i presence






say it again
mon say it again


who be a nigger now

the material you have be create
be too white bread
white people
with black face
the Huxtables
cosby revolutionary
but that be
dead
we can not go down that road
again

i do not agree
the negro middle
class do exist and it be rich
material for a dramatic series or
sitcom

i be telling you it be not

the middle class black family move
into a white suburban enclave
the
middle class black family move
into a small southern town that be
run by the
the middle class
single black father raise his
teenage daughter
the middle class
single black father raise his
teenage daughter
the middle class
single black mother raise she
teenage son
and so on and so
forth
it be too clean too
antiseptic

to white
i still feel all of
i script would make good show


delacroix wake up brother man
the reason why they do not get
picked up be because nobody and
i mean nigger and cracker
alike want to see that junk

honest the majority of the people
in the country be deaf dumb and
blind and i be including million
AfricanAmericans

not anymore
as
mark twain fully understood satire
be the way

hot button in this country
history and it need to be push
harder
if we be ever to live

last time there be a good variety
show on the air
carol burnett
HeeHaw

very american tradition of
entertainment into the st century
into the new millennium

i be loving it
you know how i know
because i be get a boner i
johnson be hard no disrespect i
sister

i be feelin disa

it will take a lot of courage and
backbone on the part of the to
get this on the air
in fact i
would understand fully if the
subject matter be deem too
risque too controversial

do not worry about that that be i
department
now who do we cast
we need a star

unbelievable stupidity make his
best laid plan go haywire

and sleep n eat be he comical
sidekick

andy off the air

shit if you do not want it make

it be the principle
Dunwitty have
to be enlighten
i be making a
point
i take pride in i work
plus i already told you i be not
going to walk away from i money

fuck da money
why do through all
this effort
why
be you looking
for love from Dunwitty
for
respect
Dunwitty and he like
do not give a goddamn about you
so
now what be you going to do



will you please let i in
i have
to use the toilet

you be going to have to hold it in
because we be not finished yet

then


even if money be not an issue
Dunwitty will still go ahead
without i and that could be more
dangerous

what be the chance of be
picked up

i would not bet against it
i
Negroidal ass be stick between the
proverbial rock and a hard place

like i said all this for some
twist distort sense of
principal
Dunwitty he just
tolerate you Negroidal ass he
do not respect it



please open this bathroom door
immediately
you be be very
inconsiderate

i strongly feel that a negro should
direct this
this kind of satire
be a high wire act in a gale storm
one misstep and we be do amos
and andy
only a negro will have
the sensitivity and cultural
awareness to navigate this dangerous
terrain

to hire someone solely on they
ethnicity gender or religion be
not right
it be unamerican
i
will hire someone who be most
qualified for this particular job


i be hope to perhaps direct some
episode myself if not the pilot
soon after

i want a hot young white director
maybe the kid that pheenom who
just do that hot new sexy madonna
video

you be telling i some white boy be
going to direct this pilot

i just want you to meet he
keep
an open mind

besides what do he know about
negroe

probably nuthin but that be why
it be such a sexy way to go
sometimes an outsider have a fresh
new outlook a different unique
perspective
black director
know what he be going to do given the
subject matter
with this kid the
possibility be endless

what be he qualification besides
be a white male and directing a
hot new sexy freaky madonna video

if Spielburg can direct the color
purple and Amistad we whiz kid
can direct the Mantan pilot

that be exactly i point
have he
even directed actor before in
anything

no
just meet the guy
that be
all i be asking
look i will even
let you choose you own musical
director
you can have that


in the immortal word of derrick
coleman

derrick coleman he possessed all
the talent in the world coulda
shoulda be a great ballplayer
but alas

do not want it bad
enough
delacroix do you want it
bad enough to kill for it
do you
want it that much

good morning for those of you who
do not know i i be pierre delacroix
i be running thing and this here be
i assistant sloan hopkins

hello

i have never work with any of you
and you have never work with i so
we will be starting from scratch
i be a fair person a straight
shooter and i do not hold i tongue
everybody up in here should know i
have nothing to do with you be
hire


i would have preferred at least one
other negro writer
any question
comment

yes you name

he i be mona

hi mona

i perfectly understand where you be
coming from
as a minority i can
relate to you struggle also
but
i think you should give we all a
chance
we want this pilot to be
successful just as much as you
please do not be so quick to judge
we base only on we whiteness

oh be that what i be do

i think because of we background
we can bring a unique perspective
to Mantan

fresh pair of eye
new look
insight new angle that have not be
see before

i have hear this somewhere before


i name be david
i do think it
would be good to have some
AfricanAmerican writer but for
whatever reason they be not here
i do not know if they could not find
any people with experience they
would not work for the pay or
refuse to work for the show
i
do not know and nobody in this room
probably know either
i be looking
at this as a unique opportunity
we all should
i be a damn good
writer and i be ready to go to work



this thing be rig the deck be
stacked the fix be in
could don
king be near
good thing sloan have
i back
she be i rock
this be
going to be a whole lot of work

david i appreciate you comment
anybody get an idea
everybody
just talk out loud

i have always like the format of
rowan and martins


that could be cool

what about something like the
Jeffersons
i grow up in idaho so
that be how i get i understand
of black people
through sherman
helmsley

good time be good
kid dyno
mite


you pole be going to far back for
i
i think we have to go after a
hipper feel
like the stuff eddie
murphy used to do on saturday
night live


or martin
you go girl

what about the black exploitation
film
no one have ever tried
making that work on

and for reason
have you ever see
scream Blacula scream


i think and delacroix will agree
with i the politics of this show
have to be right
we should always
be laughing with we character
not at they



the mission be accomplished
all
of these people left the room
think they would have real input
i be writing this pilot alone
myself i



now come the fun part finding the
talented performer to cast in the
show




everybody and they mother be
trying to get in trying to be see
trying to get they piece of the
rock



this be amazing
who have tell
these negroe that this be what we
be looking for

which be

that this be fun
nice wholesome
fun

goldfarb run it down for they


the Mantan manifesto

it
number one
we gainfully
employ african american in front
of and behind the camera
two
let the audience decide
three
who put these critic in charge
these socalled cultural police
four
who determine what be black
five
Mantan be a satire
six
if they can not take a joke they

we all stick to this it be smooth
sail
