AirSea rescue picked up nigel

with america

please be seated gentleman

churchill and stalin be asking i what
i be asking you
how long be america
going to pretend the world be not at war

we have increased supply shipment to they
mr
president and we be losing merchant
vessel every day

shift in every destroyer and anti
aircraft weapon you can find

sir we pacific fleet be already down
to almost nothing

gentleman at this moment the nation of
hungry have a large military then the
united states
we have no choice but to
draw from whatever we can

so you join we admiral
some of we
think you education at an american
university would make you too weak to
fight the american

if knowledge of opponent and careful
calculation of danger be taken as
weakness then i have misunderstood what
it mean to be japanese

the time have come to strike
or to sit
and let the american cut off we oil and
we future
i know what you whisper to
the other yamamoto that the american
be strong
yet look at they leader

franklin roosevelt
born into great
wealth
fifteen year ago he be
stricken with polio
now he cannot walk
or even stand without help
photographer will not take picture of
he in he chair
american do not wish
to know how weak they president be

you have something to say yamamoto

the council know i have opposed fight
the american
no matter how great we
resolve they have resource beyond ours
if we must go to war there be only one
way deal they a blow from which it will
take they year to recover
in that time
we can conquer all of the pacific and
they will have no choice but to ask for
peace

you see we as capable of such a blow

the american themselves have make it
possible
we will annihilate they in a
single attack at pearl harbor

if i be not nnever on a bboat again
it will be too ssoon

atlantic fleet and all the available
antiaircraft weaponry
washington have
go insane

we have do what you ordered admiral and
war gamed the likely outcome of a
japanese attack against each of we major
base in the pacific
wake guam
midway the philippines
in each case
we lose

you left out hawaii

pearl harbor can not be attack
effectively from the air
it be too
shallow for an aerial torpedo attack
pearl Harbors safe
it be everywhere
else that we be vulnerable

step up surveillance of japanese
communication
they be going to do
something somewhere
i can feel it

look at the ship all group
perfect
target

and the plane
they be what be that
american expression
sitting goose

sitting duck

how can they be so foolish

they think no one would be stupid enough
to attack they at pearl harbor

or perhaps they think no one be capable
look at this

pearl Harbors depth of only forty foot
make they feel safe
torpedo drop
from an airplane plunge to one hundred
foot before it can level off
that be a
conventional torpedo
but we have be
experiment

wooden fin
we be testing they
tomorrow

we have chosen this place because it
depth be exactly the same as pearl
Harbors

uncharged torpedoe have different
balance

i have arranged a live fire drill with
you permission

of course against a ship the explosion
will not be dissipated and will have
more force

why you have come

before rafe left he ask i to be the

he told i about you
that he have no
other friend like you

Rafes folk have a crop dust business
owned they own plane
real straight
frugal
i father be the town drunk
go to sleep one night on the railroad
track and be still there when the dawn
express come along

you be more like brother

i taught he to drink beer

he said you be the only one he ever see
who be good in the air than he

he said that

look uh
Rafes dad
he write i with
the news and it take i a couple of day
to work up the guts to come here and tell
you
i be not as brave as rafe or as
noble
but if there be anything i can
ever do to help you let i know okay

i understand why rafe loved you
you be
as strong as he be

everything real except the fact that no
one be shooting back at we

if we achieve surprise they will offer
little resistance

set up team of radio operator to send
out message the american will
intercept concerning every potential
american target in the pacific
include
hawaii the clutter will be more
confuse that way

brilliant admiral

brilliant man would find a way not to
fight a war

mr
president we have received a message
from the argentinian ambassador to japan
he source tell he the japanese be
assembling they fleet to attack we

we be picking up warning for every
american base in the pacific
do this
ambassador know the target

not for sure
but he think it be pearl
harbor

tell the pentagon

no george i need the practice in case
there be a fire

the attack seem inevitable
the
question be where
the way to answer
that question be to ask
if we be the
japanese how would we do it

between america and the far east be the
sea lane where the wind and the
current make the good route for
ship
far above be the northern
route between canada and russia
between these two be something they call
the vacant sea
if i be the jap i would
send a task force there
you could hide
the entire land mass of asia in the
vacant sea and nobody would know

so they pop out and attack where

that be the problem admiral
they could
hit anywhere they want

where be the lexington going

out on maneuver like the enterprise

jeep accident but it be quiet
except
for the occasional fighter plane buzzing

idea
they be making we fly out of a
halfpaved airfield
the real punishment
be that i will not be back to the barracks

how do you know

because we would find they

breathe easy
stay calm

you hear something

it be letting out air and letting in
water

yesterday december a date
which will live in infamy the united
state of american be suddenly and
deliberately attack by naval and air
force of the empire of japan

the distance of hawaii from japan make
it obvious that the attack be planned
many day or even week ago
during the
intervene time the japanese government
have deliberately sought to deceive the
united states by false statement and
expression of hope for continue peace

i regret to tell you that many
american live have be lost

yesterday the japanese government also
launch an attack against malaya
last
night japanese force attacked hong
kong
guam

the philippine island
wake
island
and this morning the japanese
attacked midway island

the fact speak for themselves
with
confidence in we arm force with
the unbounding determination of we
people we will gain the inevitable
triumph so help we god
i ask that
the congress declare that since the
unprovoked and dastardly attack by japan
on sunday december a state of
war

war
war
war

gentleman the crisis we face be not the
fact that we enemy believe they can
defeat we it be the fact that we people
believe it too
i want a plan a
workable plan to hit the heart of
japan to bomb they the way they have
bombed we

mr
president pearl harbor caught we
because we do not face fact
this be not
a time for ignore they again
there
be no plane in the entire american
arsenal capable of covering the distance
to japan from any land base we control
while carrying enough bomb to do any
damage whatsoever

he be right mr
president
the army have
long range bomber but no place to
launch they from
Midways too far
china be overrun by japanese force and
russia refuse to go to war with japan
and will not allow we to launch a raid from
there

the navy plane be small carry light
load and have short range
we would
have to get they within a few hundred
mile of japan and therefore risk we
carrier
and if we lose we carrier
we have no shield against invasion

what if the japanese do invade

we have do study
we be confident we
would turn they back eventually
after
they would get as far as chicago

mr
president
with all respect
what
you be asking can not be do

do not tell i
it can not be do

where be god in this
we enemy
believe a divine wind protect they
we
see we friend laid out before we and
find it hard to believe in anything at
all

though we cannot understand why we
friend should die while we live we can
affirm we true self in we belief
that any god worth divinity would choose
both justice and mercy and would take
these fall brother and sister into
eternal peace
amen

army pilot to the brief room

gentleman i can now tell you that the
target of this mission be tokyo

and where be the secret base sir
the
one we ttakeoff from

the navy will get we to within mile
of the japanese coast
we will launch off
the carrier from there

sir have this ever be do launching
an army bomber off a navy carrier

no
any other question

CColonel we be ppracticing
takeoff but i be not sure we can land
on these carrier ddecks

we will not have the fuel to get back to the
carrier
they will turn and run back to
hawaii the minute we be airborne

then whwhere do we land

i have a phrase i want you all to
memorize
Lushu hoo megwa fugi
it
mean i be an american
in chinese

Aaasshole
maybe it be llonger
going this way

it be short than we practice runway

they will turn the ship into the wind
before we launch
Thatll help

we will be loaded with pound of
bomb and pound of fuel
i get
another chinese phrase for doolittle
mug wump rickshaw mushu pork
it
means who the fuck think up this
shit


he be a navy man

maybe we will be lucky with the weather


since we will be on we own once we be in
the air i think i have a good idea
letting each crew select it be own target

now we have fifteen request for the
emperor palace
and one for tokyo
baseball stadium

i ddo not think jap ought be allow
to pplay baseball

i would like to bomb they emperor too
but
i think that would just piss they off
the
idea here gentleman be not revenge
we be here to prove to they that they be
neither invincible nor superior
so
let we try this again
military target
only

colonel to ffight you need strategy
to have strategy you get to practice
and
to practice it you get to play

no baseball diamond red

party to try to find the crew before
