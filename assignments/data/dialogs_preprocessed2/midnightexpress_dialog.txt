be in newspaper and on television
every day all around the world
the time have come you honor to
alter this image before we find
ourselves isolate and morally
ostracize by the rest of the human
race

we must alter this image by
punishing only we own drug
smugglersbut by hand out
foreigner who infest we culture
with they depravity ungodly and
behavior
we must start now by
sentencing this american Vilyum
Hiyes to the maximum sentence
for smuggling to be hold up to
the light of the world as an example
of turkish justice and it intention
to halt the drug trade once and
for all

be only for possession
the
prosecutor wanted life sentence
for smuggling
to be honest mr

into
you can drift in here
and never know you be go

turkish gangster



to the turk all foreigner be
ayip unclean dirty

shave we underarm or around we
crotch

even the yoga i sometimes do be
ayip too suggestive

because that be what they use to
wipe they ass with instead of
toilet paper
and yet they hate
pig
there be no pig in turkey
they be considered dirty

so be homosexuality
that be a big
crime here but most of they do it
every chance they get
there be
about a thousand thing that be
ayip
but they be really so
hypocritical like child breaking
the rule
for instance

you can stab or shoot some body
the but not above the waist because
that be intent to kill
so everybody
run around stab everyone else
in the ass
that be what they call
turkish revenge
there be also a
lot of baksheesh that be a favorite
turkish word for bribery

reasonable
price

protest with
he hand shaking
he head
oh no
it be out of the
question
would not want to ask
you friend

yes
please
as a favour
i insist

Hamidou hint that he need new
brace for one of he son
aslan
of course have a friend who be a
dentist
they bullshit for half
an hour and Hamidou finally accept
the baksheesh in return

dope and all kind of shipment
get deliver to aslan who re
sell it through he runner
people
like Ziat
but one night it
backfire


there be thousands of yellow
nembutols
aslan as usual have the
privilege of going into the
courtyard before anybody else to
pick up he stuff but

it happen to be a new guard
that day and he do not understand

for the proper amount of money
it be possible i can convince
certain official to lose track of
you paper before the high court
in ankara confirm the sentence of
the low court in istanbul
you
would not exist
and you could be
in greece by the time the turkish
court discovered a stupid clerical
mistake
but i have to act before
the official sentence be hand
down and for that i must pay
certain official in advance

i dear billy

mortgage of the house
money seem
to be the only way out of there
except of course the other way

but i cannot say i be for it
nor be you parent
they consult
the priest and he said to send

dear susan
poor jimmy be catch
and beaten so badly he get a severe
hernia and lost a testicle
he be
be in the hospital for month
have operation


in comparison i problem seem
very small
but two and a half
year have now go by and in
they own fashion the turk be
slowly draining i life away

i have problem with i stomach
and i leg muscle feel very weak
i gum seem to be shrink and
they sometimes bleed when i massage
they
they have pull five of i
tooth

sometimes they null the wrong
one


even i dream do not seem to
work any more
because the outside
do not seem real any more
it be
not even a fantasy
because there
be no fantasy

even masturbation have become bore
it teach you like the rest of
prison life to seal up you
emotion and this be the great
danger this be what make so many
of the man change into something
monstrous


it be erich who have taught i how
it be to be conscious to channel
and direct i energy
he have
convinced i to stop smoke
hashish he be the calm man i
have ever known
if you do not
control you energy in here if can
blow you apart like with bell
and
you can not waste it either
you
have to weigh up every one of you
action for and against
too
little sex too much sex either
will throw you off balance

he have taught i about feeling
and the need to express they
and
he have taught i about love

and what love really be beyond
it physical form

i think up
to now i have only considered i
own self never really another


and now strange as it seem
susan without have see you in
so long i feel myself more inside
of you than ever before
i feel
you female mind
i sense you
touch you

know you
and find
myself falling more and more
in love with you

chantlike
gather momentum
prison a monastery a cloister a
cave
prison monastery cloister cave
prison monastery cloister cave
prison monastery cloister cave
prison monastery cloister

prison


dear susan
erich have be
transferred to a prison back in
sweden
he have profoundly affected
i life and though i be lonely
without he i be calm than ever

though i only have day left i
feel i have never be so well
adjusted to prison and to live
as now

allah fuck off

Asina Covaciml

poor jimmy

though he health be bad he
still will not give up

he still talk of escape

what be wrong

sit down a moment billy
i be
afraid i have some bad news for
you

something happen to dad
mom

no
it look like you going to
have a new court

what do you mean

the prosecutor object to you
sentence for possession
he wanted
a smuggling conviction and the
high court in ankara reviewed it

and

we have be notify that they
rejected the sentence

there be judge on the high
court
twenty eight of they vote
for a life sentence

the low court in istanbul will
have to go along with the decision
the judge like you and he will do
the only thing he can do under the
law

he will reduce the sentence
to thirty year
we be notify
billy

what do you mean


billy
please




i

i


what be the crime
and what be
the punishment
the answer seem
to vary from place to place and
from time to time
what be legal
today be suddenly illegal tomorrow
because some society say it be so
and what be illegal yesterday all
of a sudden get legal today because
everybody do it and you can not
throw everybody in jail
well i be
not saying this be right or wrong
it be just the way thing be

but i spent the last three and a
half year of i life in you prison
and i think i paid for i error
and if it be you decision today to
sentence i to more year i
i
you know i lawyer told i be
cool
billy do not get upset do not get
angry if you be good i can maybe
get a pardon an amnesty an appeal
this that and the other thing

well that be be going down now
for year

and i have be playing it cool and
i have be good and now i be damn
tire of be good because you people
give i the belief that i have
day left
you hung day in
front of i eye and then you take
those day away and mister
prosecutor
i just wish you
could

stand right here where i be
stand and feel what that
feel like because then you would
know something you do not know you would
know what mean mister prosecutor
and you would know the concept of a
society be base on the quality of
it mercy mean of it sense of
fair play it sense of justice
but
shrug and scoff
at himself
i guess that be just like asking a
bear to shit in a toilet

same selfmocking
tone
for a nation of pig it be funny
you do not eat they
fuck it give
i the sentence
jesus forgive the
bastard but i can not
i hate you
nation
i hate you i hate you
people
