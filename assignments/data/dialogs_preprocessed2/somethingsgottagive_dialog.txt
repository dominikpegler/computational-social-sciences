joke
what be that

it be a hip hop label

hip hop
oh rap
oh right
well
okay
that be
interesting

let i see if i get where you be
headed here



i be sorry but look you know i hate
rap i mean i do
it be sort of violent
and crude for i taste not to mention
just a tad misogynistic

hey a lot of people see rap as
poetry

yeah but come on how many word
can you rhyme with bitch

how we doin


should have left when she tried to arrest
i

so mom how be the new play
you gettin
happy with it

well the thing with i be that i be about
hard word talent and so far the
talent part have not exactly kick in yet

yeah right

what be you play about

about
well i be not exactly sure which
be a bit of a problem but so far it be
about a divorce woman a writer she be
this high string overamped
controlling know it all neurotic


who be incredibly cute and lovable
it be a comedy

so how do you two meet

at a wine auction at sothebys
harry be
the big buyer of the night

i keep wink at marin as she be
conducting the auction and apparently
every time i do that she misunderstand
and i end up buying case of
outrageously expensive wine


ever be marry harry

no
no i have not

wow
now why do you think that be

some people just do not fit the mold
and
so far

hey if it be not broke

exactly

wait a second be not you like a famous
bachelor

i would not say i be famous

no i think i read a piece on you
in new york magazine

i guess people find it interesting
that i have escaped the noose for so
long

yeah be not the name of the article
the escape artist

wait
i read that article
that be you
you be once engaged to somebody big
who be it
not joan collins

wait
carly simon

yeah it be somebody cool like that
not martha stewart


you could just
ask he

no this be more fun
it be like i be
not here

harry be once engaged to diane
sawyer
okay

right
diane sawyer
i love she

i be impress

yeah woman you age love that
about i

you know what i mean

yes i do

it be not a bad thing to say woman
you agee

no
i be sure it be a compliment

it be

just the truth

so when be this engagement

long time ago
she be just this
adorable lanky girl from kentucky
with the great pair of leg i would
ever see
never understood she
ending up with a job where she
never show they





oe teach womens study at






forgive i honey for saying this
but they want girl that look like
marin so the whole over fifty
date scene be geared completely
towards man leaving old woman out
and as a result that make the
old woman more and more
productive and more and more
interesting which in turn make
they even less desirable because as
we all know man especially
old man be threatened and
deathly afraid of interesting and
accomplish woman
it be just so
clear
single old woman as a
demographic be as fucked a group
as can ever exist

what be you possess
how could
you say those thing

it just seem so obvious to i
the
injustice of it
thank god man die
young than we
it be the only break we
get

then you know what
write a dissertation
on it do not announce to the world that i
stay in night after night after night and
by the way one night after night would
have be enough
do you ever realize i
stay in as part of i job
why do you
think i married the director of i play
he be the only man i ever see
anyway i
like staying in and i like this time in
i life
why do i have to defend myself
arin carrying more dish

what the hell be that















i love you more

i will take that as a yes

you want a glass of wine or
something

i be just going to give you a kiss
hello

oh okay

i remember you said if we still
know each other we should go to
paris for we birthday well we
still know each other


that be true but harry i have not
hear from you in six month


i know but i have certainly be think
about you
there be a lot i have to say
first thing be
i be not mad at you
anymore

good because i be not mad at you
anymore either

that be a relief
since i do come all
the way to france and everything
and
happy birthday

afraid of everything he
could possibly say
thank you

and congratulations on you amazing
success

it be be quite a ride
funny i think
maybe i would hear from you when it opened
where have you be

after i see you in the theater that
afternoon i have another episode

oh i be sorry

i be actually okay but i be sure i be
die and the doctor in the said i needed
to decompress
so i do
i walk out of
there and changed i life sold most of i
business packed i bag and moved to an
island in the caribbean


that be where you have be all this
time
in the caribbean

actually
no




i be there about six hour when it
occur to i that wasting away on an
island in the caribbean be not going to
remotely cure what be ail i



so i decided to take another kind of
pilgrimage
into i past



i thought be if i retrace i step
and visit all the woman i have dated


maybe i could figure out how i
get so screw up



lot of the woman would not see i



or speak to i



but i be on a mission to save i
soul





i lose streak finally end when
i get one to open up to i



hearing what they have to say be no
picnic




but i stick it out and i listen
then i listen harder



and one of the thing i realized
be i be actually giving closure
to generation of woman



although i admit some refuse to
give no matter what i do






when you hear the same story about
yourself over and over you life
begin to make sense and the future
become you only salvation

all
