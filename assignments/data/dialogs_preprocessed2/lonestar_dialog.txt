command of this unit and i look
forward to working with all of you



i be sure you be all aware of the
Armys decision to close this
installation under the reduction in
force plan
that do not mean
however

that we have be send here to mark
time until we be absorbed by another
unit

you may have hear rumor that i run
a very tight operation
these rumor
be not exaggerate

he think you be trying to duck
he

he be right

you be not in here tonight be
you

no sir

go out through the back

you be just tearin everything down
Tearin down we heritage tearin
down the memory of people that fight
and die for this land



we fight and die for this land
too

we fight the you

army the texas
rangers



yeah but you lost buddy

winner get the brag right
that be how it go



Peoplepeople

i think it would be good not to put
thing in term of winner and loser

well the way she be teachin it have
get everything switched around
i
be on the textbook committee and
she version be not

we think of the textbook as kind of
a guide not an absolute

it be not what we set as the
standard
now you people can believe
what you want but when it come to
teaching we child

they be we child too

the man who found this state have
a right to have they story

the man who found this state broke
from mexico because they needed
slavery to be legal to make a fortune
in the cotton business

i think that be a bit of an
oversimplification

be you reporting this meet or
runnin it danny

just add a little historical
perspective

you may call it history but i call
it propaganda
i be sure they get
they own account of the alamo on
the other side but we be not on the
other side so we be not about to
have it taught in we school

there be no reason to be so threatened
by this

i have only be trying to get across
some of the complexity of we
situation down herecultures coming
together in both negative and positive
way



if you mean like music and food and
all i have no problem with that

but when you start changing who
do what to who

we be not changing anything we be
present a more complete picture

and that be what be get to stop

there be enough ignorance in the world
without we encouraging it in the
classroom

now who be you calling ignorant

folk i know this be a very emotional
issue for some of you but we do
have other business to attend to

we be not going to get some resolution
on this

would you people like to form another
committee

i hope the sucker do die man
mess with i that be what you get

hospital say the other kid be in
bad shape

the shooter local

the girl before
