do not believe that be the case
i have
i own theory
the death of jesus be
predict thousands of year before
judas ever come along
and for the
prophecy to be fulfilled jesus have to
die
if he do not the gate of
heaven could not be open for mankind
i do not think for an instant judas
wanted to be the one but
someone
have to
judas helped jesus so jesus
could die for we sin
save we all
and i believe at this moment
judas
be in heaven despite he sin because
it lead to the great good
relation prior to marriage be a sin
you and sheryl be sinner in the
lords eye
and because of those
sin you soul be damn
