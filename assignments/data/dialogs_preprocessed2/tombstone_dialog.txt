the civil war created an
unprecedented nationwide market
for beef
previously worthless
cattle running wild throughout
texas be gathered into herd
and drive north to the railhead
in kansas
fortune be make as
Cowtowns spring up on the
prairy wideopen center of
commerce and vice they street
choke with heavilyarmed young
man fresh from the cattle drive
in those day the correct term
for a cowhand be drover
cowboy like cowpoke be
originally an insult imply
deviant sexuality and be rarely
used
but these invading drover
be a wild breed for soon
shooting and wholesale drunken
riot become so frequent that
ordinary citizen literally could
not walk down the street
in fact
at they height the cowtowns have
high murder rate than modern
new york or los angeles and there
be no law but that of the gun




Straightup at yard or eye
toeye at pointblank range the
great gunman of all time be
an illinois abolitionist farm boy
named james butler hickok well
known as wild bill the prince of
Pistoleers
but wild bill work
he trade on the side of justice
and as marshal of cowtowns like
hays city and abilene he become a
legend the one man who stand
between law and chaos




wild bill fame spread nation
wide but he end come quietly in
the spring of when a strange
crosseyed little drifter put a
bullet through the back of he
head apparently for no other
reason than he wanted to kill a
celebrity




in dodge city meanwhile wyatt
earp and bat masterson be
become known as fastguns
but
they fame have nothing to do with
shooting




earp and masterson operate more
like modern policeman use
teamwork and persuasion to keep
order
still sometimes thing
get out of hand




but wyatt have a guardian angel




john henry doc holliday be
the son of an aristocratic
highly culture southern family
trained in philadelphia he have
embark on a career as a society
dentist when he contracted
tuberculosis
advise to practice
in the west where it be think
the climate and clean air would
prolong he life doc soon
realize it be all only a matter
of time and give up dentistry to
become a professional gambler and
gunman




other headed east
bend on
becoming an actress
josephine
marcus defy she wealthy and
very proper san francisco jewish
family to run away with a
travel theatrical company
brave the peril of the
frontier on she own
dangerous as
this might seem it be another
age and woman be so rare they
presence so cherish that they
could travel virtually anywhere
in the west in perfect safety




at about this time the texas
rangers have eliminate the
commanche threat turned they
attention to the outlaw gang
maraud along the rio grande
cleaning up the border strip in
year of hard riding
those they
could not indict or convict the
rangers put down in they black
book letting it be known that
they could either leave texas or
face summary execution
this
result in the mass migration of
the absolute dregs of the texas
underworld to the most dangerous
uncivilized part of the entire
country the southeast corner of
the arizona territory




harsh and inhospitable savage
in turn by the apache and mexican
bandit this have always be an
accursed place a virtual hell on
earth where it be think life
itself could never prosper much


cont

less civilization
then in
a prospector named ed Schiefflin
set off alone into the dragoon
mountain
friends told he he
be crazy that the only thing
he would find in this godforsaken
place would be he tombstone
instead he find silver lots of
it and overnight the town of
tombstone spring up
mining
take out millions in ore
land
value shoot skyhigh and
speculator and gambler and
opportunist of all nation
scramble in by the thousands to
make tombstone queen of the
Boomtowns so rich that the
late paris fashion hard to
find even in the big city
be sell there by the wagonload
from the makeshift storefronts




meanwhile the exile texan have
banded together to form the
nucleaus of an organized gang
seize controp of the
surrounding countryside they
robbed stagecoach at will while
the big absentee business
interest employed they as tax
collector and strongarm man
but
the backbone of they trade
remain border rustle
periodic raid into mexico to
steal cattle while engaging in
what be described as a virtual
orgy of murder and violence
the
raid become so frequent and so
bloody that the mexican
government formally protest to
you

president chester
arthur
prompt heated debate in
congress
general sherman
declare that the only possible
way of bringing order be to send
in the army but in the wake of
civil war reconstruction federal
intervention in civilian affair
be politically impossible




with only some member the
gang be an elite body of gunman
known by the red silk sash they
wear around they waist
fiercely proud of they
terrifying reputation and
answerable to no one they be a
law unto themselves finally
emerge as one of the early
example in american history of
fullscale organized crime




they called themselves the
cowboy
