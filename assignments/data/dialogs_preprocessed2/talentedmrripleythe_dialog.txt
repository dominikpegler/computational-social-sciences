i mean it as a compliment
you have get
such great taste i do not know
most of
the thug at princeton have taste
everything and have no taste
used to say
the cream of america

ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
noto non e riuscito a impedire il
verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
greenleaf il quale era lunica persona
al momento passibile di incriminazione
del reato di omicidio del signor miles

he be taken over the case because
they be annoy the previous chap let
dickie
disappear when he be the only
he be the only suspect in freddies
murder

quando e stata ultima volta che il
signor ripley ha visto il signor
greenleaf
when be the last time ripley see
greenleaf


in rome about three week ago
i know that one

roma circa tre settimane fa

dove e stato il signor ripley da allora

where have you be since then

i have be backpack

i do not know how to translate that
difficile
il signor ripley
dormiva allaperto con un

Allaperto
col freddo che ha fatto

he think it be very cold to be sleep
outside

il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
omosessuali

be you a homosexual
interesting nonsequitur

no

no
by the way officially there be no
italian homosexual
make leonardo
michelangelo very inconvenient

tell he i have a fiancee dickie have a
fiancee and freddie miles probably have a
string of they

il signor ripley ha una fidanzata il
signor dickie ha una fidanzata e
probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha
molte fidanzate

mamma mia quante fidanzate

no i do not
i do not kill freddie
mile and then kill dickie greenleaf
be
he accusing i
ask he if he be accusing i

Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
conversazioni private
this be not the
place for you private conversation

ragione
ragione
you be right
you be right


hmm
ce questa
there be this


questa lettera e stata trovata
nellabitazione del signor richard
greenleaf a roma

they find this in dickies place in
rome

you opened this

of course

it be a suicide note
you ask i all these question and you have
already read this suicide note
stabat mater
peters make supper

can you imagine if dickie do kill
freddie what must that be like
to wake
up every morning how can you
just wake
up and be a person drink a coffee

whatever you do however terrible
however hurtful it all make sense
do not it
inside you head
you never
meet anybody who think they be a bad
person or that they be cruel

but you be still tormented you must be
you have killed somebody

do not you put the past in a room in the
cellar and lock the door and just never
go in there
because that be what i do

probably
in i case it be probably a
whole build

then you meet someone special and all you
want to do be toss they the key say
open
up step inside
but you can not because
it be dark and there be demon and if
anybody see how ugly it be

that be the music talking
harder to be
bleak if you be playing
knee up mother
brown

i keep wanting to do that fling open
the door let the light in clean
everything out
if i could get a huge
eraser and rub everything out
start
with myself

the day he be late back
from rome i tried to tell you this he
be with another girl
i be not talking
about meredith another girl we meet in a
bar
he could not be faithful for five
minute
so when he make a promise it
do not mean what it mean when you make
a promise
or i do
he have so many
reality dickie and he believe they
all
he lie
he lie that be his
half
the time he do not even realize

today for the first time i have even
wonder whether he might have killed
freddie
he would get so crazy if anybody
contradict he well you know that
marge
i loved you you might as well
know i loved you and because he know i
loved you he let you think i loved he
do not you see could not you see
i do not
know maybe it be grotesque to say this
now so just write it on a piece of paper
or something and keep it in you purse
for a rainy day
tom love i

why do you have dickies ring

i told you
he give they to i

why
when

i feel as if you have not hear anything
i have be saying to you

i do not believe you

it be all true

i do not believe a single word you have
said

you be shivering marge
can i hold you
would you let i hold you
straight into the arm of a startle who be come

oh peter

i give up

you can not be angry with she
she be upset
and need someone to blame
so she blame
you
i will go home and talk to she
as
for you either get a safety razor or
grow a beard

be mr greenleaf here

mr ripley
i be alvin MacCarron

i do not know i do not know i just know
it

marge there be female intuition and
then there be fact

tom

hello sir
marge you should have wait do not
peter tell you i would come by and pick you
up

marge have be telling we about the
ring

you know i feel ridiculous i do not
mention they yesterday i clean forget
ridiculous

perhaps you do not mention they because
there be only one conclusion to be draw

i be going to take marge for a little
walk tom
mr MacCarron want to talk
with you

we could go down to the bar no need for
you to

no he should talk to you alone

i could probably see i bedroom from
here
i can see i house
when you see
where you live from a distance it be like
a dream be not it

i do not care for

i do not care to
hear it
i do not care to speak it

okay

why do you think dickies father send he
to europe in the first place
do you
know at princeton dickie greenleaf half
killed a boy

at a party
over some girl
he kick the
kid several time in the head
put he in
the hospital
the boy have a wire fixed in
he jaw
the rome police do not think to
ask mr greenleaf

nor do they think to check whether a
thomas ripley have ever be a student at
princeton university
i turned up a tom
ripley who be a piano tuner in the
music department

see in america we be taught to check a
fact before it become a fact
we be
taught to nose around when a girl drown
herself find out if that girl be
pregnant find out if dickie have an
embarrassment there

mr greenleaf appreciate you loyalty
he really do
marge she be get a
hundred theory but there be a few
thing she do not know
we hope she
never know

i hope she never know

three different people see dickie get
into freddie miles car
man who will not
identify himself because he be jumping
someone else wife at the time see
dickie remove license plate from a red
sport car
the police know about this
man because he happen to be a policeman

i find these in the basement of dickies
apartment
they belong to freddies
car
mr greenleaf have ask i to lose
they in the canal this evening

mr greenleaf also feel there be a
silent promise in dickies letter to you
which he intend to honor
he intend to
transfer a good part of dickies income
from he trust into you name
he do not
intend to give the italian police any
information about dickies past
he be
rather hope you will feel the same

i feel i never should have say those
thing to you the other evening
i be
pretty fluster the ring and and you
look so i do not know

but i hope that note go to new york in
you purse for a rainy day

athens next month and he be ask if i
