john orloff
over the of city traffic

the sidewalk be filled with theatergoers heading for
they show
cab line the street

cab quickly turn into the alley coming to a
screeching halt
man in a grey suit jump out and
rush to the side entrance of a theater
in the background we see that the title of the play
anonymous be written on the theatre marquee
we follow the man in the grey suit as he rush through
narrow backstage hallway passing several
dress in elizabethan costume apply they make
up etc

the curtain be still closed and the sound of the
audience excitedly behind they be hear

stagehand be moving stage light as

take a nervous peek through the curtain to check the
audience it be a full house
he hold a prop umbrella
in one hand anxiously check he watch in the other
he look on both wing of the stage and then relief
flood he face as he see the man in the grey suit
hurry over to he
the stage manager wordlessly
hand he the umbrella and signal to a stagehand in
the background
the curtain start to and the of the
audience die down

pg

the man with the umbrella stand on the empty stage a
single light on he
he be
we will see
the same actor later as the prologue of henry
prologue regards he audience for a beat before

soul of the age
the applause delight the wonder of
we stage
we shakespeare rise
we shakespeare
for he be all of
ours be he not
the most perform
playwright of all time
the author of
play sonnet and several
epic poem that be collectively known
as the ultimate expression of
humanity in the english language
and
yet
and yet
not a single manuscript of any kind
have ever be find written in
shakespeares own hand
in four
hundred year not one document be
it poem play diary or even a simple
letter
he be born the son of a glovemaker
and at some unknown time armed with
but an elementary school education he
go to london where the story go
he become an actor and eventually a
playwright

stagehand take a wooden hammer and beat against a
flat metal pate create the of
another stagehand start to lift shutter in front of a
stage light back and forth to create

prologue open he umbrella

he die at the age of and be
survive by he wife and two daughter
who be like shakespeares own
father irrefutably illiterate

pg




he will famously left he second good
bed to he widow
but it make no
mention of a single book or
manuscript

be it possible shakespeare owned no
book at he death because
he could
not read
that he write no letter
because he like he father before he
and he child after he could not
write
we shakespeare be a cypher a ghost
he biography make not by history
but by conjecture
he story not
written with fact but with
imagination

so
let i offer you a different
story
dark story
of quill
and sword
of power and betrayal
of a stage conquer and a throne
lost

some of william cecils
recent correspondence with king james
of scotland

pg


cecils all but promising he the
throne

to james
elizabeth would never agree
to

elizabeth be old
i will
not of she
old mind
sometimes she do not even
recognize i
and yet still she
refuse to name an heir

but a scotsman
on the tudor throne

you be not in the privy council
elizabeth do everything the cecils
wish of she
everything

think henry if james owe cecil he
throne cecil will have more influence
in the next reign than he do in this
one
and after william cecil he
hunchback son will take his
place
that be why we must do everything in
we power to ensure that the right man
succeed she
man deserving of the tudor crown

i ask you for the support of you and
you man henry
if it come to a
fight

and i for one would
rather bow to a tudor bastard though
he may be than a scotsman

i desire nothing more than to see the
next king be the rightful king

what essex contemplate will surely
lead to civil war
no
if this be to be do it must be
do carefully skillfully
