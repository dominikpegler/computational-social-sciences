hope to create a change man by
surrounding he with the bad in
he fellow man
what it
rehabilitates be solely a conviction
that if he can survive the inhumanity
of prison what then can he not
withstand

soul and keep he sight

of reservation casino success story
still many native believe that

materialism and greed that will only
infect the soul of indigenous people
until they love of money have
destroyed the spiritual value they
ancestor die to protect and they
homeland have become no different
from any unite states suburb
satellite city or industrial park
destroy the indian legacy once
and for all and leaving behind a
nation of selfish angry native of
