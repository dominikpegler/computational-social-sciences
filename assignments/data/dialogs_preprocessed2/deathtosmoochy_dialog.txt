the moment

we can do well than this guy

and
we be in a dickmeasuring contest
with brown brown over the
shampoo split

okay time out people
if i may
interject i think we be putting
the cart before the horse here


Smoochys still earn the trust
of the kid
we do not want to
compromise that by asking they to
buy shampoo and cheese
how about we
just concentrate on do the good
show possible
huh

the bell and whistle and
rickatarackita

estimate

i just want the show to have some
weight you know
some substance
silly song sure but with a
message
pop quiz
how many
original composition be in the
smoochy songbook

do you sense i complete lack of
interest

try two thousand
covering every
topic from how yummy vegetable
be to the importance of donate
plasma
do not you get it nora
i be a valuable resource
use i

can i make this real easy for you

the only reason you be on right
now be because rainbow randolph be
a degenerate scumbag
i do not
discover you i deliver you

big emotional investment in i
nail polish
so do not peddle you
sap to i rhino
you job be
just to smile and nod you head


no no you misunderstand i
it be not that i be literally
compare captain kangaroo to
jesus christ

that the captain like christ be
someone you could believe in
those guy do not care about bell
and whistle and rickitarackata
it be all about the work
especially jesus
