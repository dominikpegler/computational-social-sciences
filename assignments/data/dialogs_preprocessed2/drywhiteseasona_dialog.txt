he survey the

then with
a serious tone

be only the late in score
of black youth who have

custody


what do she expect

i god one hundred shot
they
do not have to kill they

this bloody Bruwer woman report
one hundred shot but the radio
said only twenty and the police

what the hell be you playing at

as he burst into
loud laugh
precaution Lanie

do not call i Lanie
what do
that mean anyway

you will not understand Lanie


i think i be without awareness
i have always care about people
call it a social conscience
but
i visit to gordons house make i
experience another dimension of
human condition

the poverty ja

no i expect that
but
listening to they talk make i
realize that i do not know the
black
now i question i
attitude i concern as ben and
complacence as a white person

ben i know you anxiety about the
inquest
all will be clear up
in a legal way and you will be back
to you normal self
now let we
turn off the light

dr
jansen you be a state
pathologist of many year
standing and i have no doubt a
wellqualified pathologist
could you now please tell we
what cause the death of the
deceased


i find that death have be cause
by the application of force to
the neck consistent with
hanging


you be sure about the hang
this pressure on the neck could
it also have be exert in other
way


it could but it be not for i
to speculate

of course not doctor
the list
of injury find on the body be
horrifyingly long
bruise
swelling abrasion break rib
laceration etc
how long before
death do you estimate he received
these injury


i could not say exactly

roughly


some be fourteen to twenty day
old other three to four day and
other even more recent

even more recent
i see
i
understand you have a dr
Hassiem
present at the autopsy


that be correct


there be two report ours and
he
do they tally


yes it be
in most respect

be not it normal practice to have
one report
why do dr
Hassiem
decide to draw up a separate
report
if he really cosigned
yours


that be for he to answer

i would very much like to dr
jansen but he be be detain
you know of course that he
represent the Ngubene family
thank you


dr
herzog do you examine the
deceased


yes one day captain stolz called
i in
the man have toothache

that be all


as far as i could tell yes


you do not examine he thoroughly


why should i
the man be
perfectly healthy just
complaining of toothache
i
extracted three decay tooth and
give he aspirin for the pain
that be all

do the captain or anyone else
assist you during the examination


i
i cannot remember

more aggressive and
accuse
dr
herzog tell we
have you
be intimidated by the security
police or do you deliberately
cooperate with they in playing
they disgusting little game of
hideandseek

jumping up from his
seat
i protest you worship

advocate de villiers will you
refrain from insinuation

thank you doctor herzog
i be
sure gordon Ngubene be extremely
grateful

advocate louw


thank you you worship
i would
like to call captain stolz

you be a police officer station
at john vorster square

that be right you worship

you arrest gordon Ngubene
could you describe what happen

act on information we have
received i go to the house of
the deceased accompany by
lieutenant venter lieutenant
botha and three native member
of the security force
this be
about

i informed Ngubene
that he be under arrest under
article of the terrorism act
he then become violent and resist
arrest
certain force have to be
applied to restrain he

we find several incriminate
document
these pointed to his
involvement with the


and
activity endanger the
security of the state


be the deceased ever assault to
you knowledge

never
he be always treated with
courtesy and correctness
but
one time we have because to use force
against he
it be the day before
he death
the deceased suddenly
show sign of aggression
he
tried to jump through the open
window of i office
he be
acting like a mad man
it take
six of i man to restrain he
and he have to be manacled hand
and foot for he own safety
but once he calm down he be
ready to make a statement about
he activity
the next morning
we find he dead in he cell

be the statement in evidence

no you worship
it can not be
disclosed in court without
damaging we investigation but
i would like to offer into
evidence a suicide note written
by the deceased

dear captain
i prefer to die
rather than betray any more of
i friend
Amandla
gordon
Ngubene


thank you you worship

advocate de villiers


thank you you worship
captain
stolz you said you treated the
deceased always with courtesy and
correctness then how do you
account for the injury find on
the body

sometimes detainee deliberately
injure themselves for propaganda
purpose

you say he tried to jump out of
the open window
be there no
bar to prevent such an act

they have be remove for repair

and why do he wish to jump out
because you be torture he

he be not torture

perhaps it be the toothache then

you said you seize incriminate
document at the deceased home
can you produce they to see how
subversive he be

those document cannot be
introduced as evidence you
worship in view of the fact that
state security be involved


i put it to you captain that
the only subversive activity
the deceased have be involved in
be he effort to establish
what happen to he son
jonathan allegedly shoot during
a riot although several witness
be prepare to testify that he
die in detention one month later

i protest

this would support i case that an
innocent man have die in you hand
under highly questionable
circumstance

if it please you worship
this
unwarranted slur on the integrity
of the special branch be
unacceptable
and base i may
say on allegation which be in
any case irrelevant to the present
inquest

i agree

if the police be really interest
in retaining an unsullied
reputation they should not object
to the real fact be presented
thank you captain

the real fact be be presented
as the follow affadivits
prove
they be all by detainee
who testify that they have all
see the deceased intermittently
from the time of he detention
to the time of he death and on
all occasion he be in good
health


i trust the signatory of these
document
be available to
corroborate they evidence in
person

mr
archibald when do you first
meet gordon Ngubene

looking at black
crowd then to de
villiers

adjourn we will reconvene at two
thirty


de villiers be making mincemeat
of they

he be very good
he cross
examination have get they rattle

it be obvious to anybody
the
evidence be clear
do you see Archibals back
he
do not have to tell the truth


that be what stolz be saying to
he right now in he torture room


captain stolz lie
i husband
never fight the police when he
be arrested
they be rough
with he pushing he and
threaten

when you husband clothes be
given to you in what condition
be they

the back pocket i find three
break tooth

Advocte louw

magistrate and in
firm voice
they killed i husband and son


to a policeman next

i would like to call i last witness
grace Nkosi

be you ever detain

yes sir at john vorster square

for how long

six month

can you tell we what happen to
you during that time

i be interrogate by many special
policeman but mainly captain stolz
and the one they call venter
as
they be searching somebody i
know they wanted i to tell they
where that person be hidden
as
i refuse to cooperate they beat i
with a sjambok
after some time
i fell and they kick i in the
face and stomach


i spot blood and they try to make
i lick it
then captain stolz

say you make it
up

it be the truth
i have nothing
more to say

we shall adjourn until tomorrow
morning
i will hear the argument
and give the verdict


i wish to thank both advocate for
conducting this case without
rancour and in the good tradition
of the south african legal
profession


i have listen to all the
evidence and the argument
to
begin with i have to say that
there be no conclusive evidence
offered to prove beyond doubt that
member of the security police have
be guilty of assault or any
irregular conduct on the deceased
there be indication that
Ngubene be aggressive and on more
than one occasion have to be
restrain with force
there be
sufficient evidence to conclude
that death have be cause by a
trauma follow pressure applied
to the neck consistent with
hanging
consequently i find
that gordon Ngubene committed
suicide by hanging himself and
that on available evidence he
death cannot be attribute to any
act or omission or amount to
a criminal offense on the part of
any person

to say
mr
Cloete may i ask what on
earth have the picture to do with
politics
i be sorry mr
Cloete
i have to go


everything be examine in depth
in court

do you read the paper Dominee
be you happy with what come to
light
and be it the magistrate
work to pretend that the fact
which come to light do not exist

be it really fact ben

ja
what be it tom

do the baas want i to bring the
bull now

later tom

Dankie baas

i buy a bull last week

i know gordon
what they said about
he that he be plotting against
the government be a downright
lie
he be only do what i
would have do as a father
searching for he son

no one but god can see what be in
we heart


be not it presumptuous to pretend
we can speak for someone else

have you no faith in you fellow
man Dominee
do not you love you
neighbor

wait a minute instead of
criticize blindly do not you
think we have reason to be proud
of the judiciary we have
suppose
this have be russia
what do you
think would have happen then

what be the use of reaching a
court when a handful of people
have all the power to decide what
be going to be say in that court
and by whom
the one man they
allow to speak for himself that
young archibald Chigorimbo do not
he immediately deny everything
they forced he to say in his
statement
and the girl who
spoke of she own torture


that do not refer to we
situation in this south africa
do you know what i believe in
Dominee that once in one life
just once one should have enough
faith in something to risk
everything for it

one can gain the world and still
lose one soul
tea must be
ready


i hope you do not mind we talking
here

i do not mind mr
Cloete

i will come to the point
you can not
imagine how shock i be by that
scandalous photograph in the
Ossewa

the woman lost she husband she
be shattered with grief

kaffir woman du Toit

i can not see that it make any
difference

have you go color blind then
and what about the apartheid law
we first responsibility as
teacher be the reputation of the
school the pupil entrust to
we
we have to be an example to
they in and out of this school
yard


i think i have warn you about
involve yourself with kaffir
obviously you do not heed i
advice
that be all i have to say
for now

morning Oom ben

acknowledge
greet
Viviers

private coffee with Cloete

good afternoon professor

melanie be not home
you be

ben du Toit
you have a nice
vegetable garden

you mean the area or the produce

both
what plant be these


what be the world coming to
it be
herb can not you see
thyme
there oregano over there feunel
next to the tomato sage here
and rosemary somewhere
poor
plant they re not in they ideal
soil or climate
next time i will
bring some soil from the mountain
of zeus
perhaps the old mane
holiness will do the trick

come you be just the person to
sample i greengage wine
i do not
suppose you have ever taste it
i be sure i be the only person in
the country making greengage wine

the first bottle this year and
you do not have to tell i if you
like it or not
tell i do you
ever study philosophy

not really
i have read a few
book

not bad in fact quite good
now
where be i
oh i be going to
say after decade of philosophy i
find myself be forced back to
the earth
do you know ben we be
all live in the spell of
abstraction
hitler apartheid
the great american dream the lot

what about jesus

misunderstand


refer to the
wine
you do not have to finish it

it be quite nice

melanie have tell i a little about
you
it be not an easy road you
have chosen

i feel i have no choice

of course you have a choice
damn it
one always have a choice
only thank god you make the choice
you do
but all i want to say
be keep you eye open young
man

that be encourage

we be both boer ben
we know
how hard we people worked to get
a toehold on this land
it be a
good life
now look at the mess
it be all system and no god
sooner or late people start
believe in they way of life as
an absolute
unmutable
fundamental a precondition
see
it with i own eye in germany
a nation running after an idea
Sieg heil sieg heil
i left
there thirty year ago because i
could not take it any longer
and
now i see it happening in i own
country step by step
terrifyingly predictable
this
sickness of the great abstraction


what you say be very interesting
and important

take for example the way the
government be handling the
electorate
like a bloody donkey
carrot in front and kick at the
backside
the carrot be
apartheid dogma
the kick be
quite simply fear
black peril
red peril whatever name you want
to give it
fear can be a wonderful ally ben
i talk too much i always do with
young people they do not fall
asleep to i

we afrikaner have to stop to turn
a blind eye and look around we and
at ourselves

you be right
we still have
time
history should teach we
about those who regard
themselves as the choose people

standing up
comfort
professor Bruwer may i say i have
needed to hear somebody say some
of the thing you said
i still
have hope for we country

if you lose that you have lost
everything
i will get back to the
earth

thank you


i will tell that hothead daughter
of mine that you come to see she

there be absolutely no doubt that
they be killed in custody
those responsible must be
punished whoever they be or
whatever they rank

the problem be laying we hand on
they

tell i dan we lost at the
inquest what next

the family can file a civil claim

what do that entail

to put it briefly it mean we
have to have witness affidavit
and any information relate to
the arrest and death of gordon
we also need similar information
on jonathan
you see ben for
example stolz figure in both
case
that be one link at least

i know what i have to do


i do not think you would want to
have anything to do with i after
that crap in the Ossewa

why
you do not write it

i be a journalist perhaps tar
with the same brush

no

so what happen
i can imagine
the family the dominee
colleague neighbor

distort photograph and a few
poison word and meneer du Toit
be a leper
that be why i called
on you the other day i needed to
talk to somebody rational

thanks for the compliment
but
remember you be an afrikaner
you be one of they
in they eye
they regard you as the bad kind
of traitor

you be an afrikaner too and you
article in a liberal english
paper

i mother be a foreigner i be not
pure wragte afrikaner
they
do not expect the same loyalty from
i that they demand from you

what kind of loyalty
blind
loyalty
until the death of
jonathan and gordon i give all
the loyalty i could give laager
loyalty
you know melanie we
afrikaner have always live in
we laager we have not see
what be beyond the mountain


have it ever occur to you that
the volk may be scare to leave the
laager
that be the downfall of
this country
so where do you go
from here

we carry on
there have to be
justice

justice

we lost at the inquest so we
pursue they in a civil action
i
consult the attorney dan
Lewinson

we know each other well


mr
du Toit if you know what
we be working with every day of
we live and what we be up
against you would understand
why we have to be so thorough

however you go about it

i can understand you be upset
about have you house search
but

i be not think about myself

what be you talking about then
mr
du Toit

i thought captain i be sure
be an open book to you


an interesting book picasso
not one i be familiar with

not on you list of ban book
captain


mr
du Toit
if you be keeping
anything from we we can turn this
whole house upside down if we want
to
we have all the time in the
world

throwing ben a
warn dagger
look
i be afraid i do not understand

why do not you go upstairs

i be afraid she have to stay where
we can see she in case she
wanted to warn someone

i father an

warn who


roast beef i hope it be like you
mother

papa

disgrace you


i expect you a little late

walking in with golf
club bag
in the study

fine

and how be you ma

well ben still have trouble with
i foot

why do not everyone sit down

i will prepare some tea
i bake a
cake


i be get tire of the trek to
cape town and then back to
pretoria
if i have i way
parliament and government would
be in the same city
there be
nothing wrong with pretoria

i think you would prefer cape town
the sea and table mountain

that be for holiday
anyway ben
one of the reason for this visit
be that i wanted to have a
discussion with you

what about

it be that photograph in the
paper
ben a thing like that
could be an embarrassment for
someone who be a member of
parliament
it be a grievous day
when one family behavior
come between he and he duty
to the fatherland

be you blame i for trying to
help those people

i have be do that all i life
be they black or white
but no
member of we family have be see
with a kaffir woman before ben

i be glad you mention it father
because i would like to discuss the
whole thing with you
first
there be the matter of gordon
Ngubene himself

what about he
i think the
case be closed



the inquest do not clear up half
of what happen

oh really

we have no irrefutable evidence
yet but we have enough to
indicate that something serious be
be covered up

you be jumping to conclusion
ben

i know what i be talking about
the black waiter place the drink on the table

all right ben i be listening
perhaps i can use i influence
but you will have to convince i

if they have really nothing to
hide why be the special branch
going out of it way to intimidate
i

what be this about special branch

they raid the house
they be
tapping i phone and i have be
threatened by one of the officer

i be sorry ben i would rather not
have anything to do with this sort
of thing

why

if the special branch be involved
they must have good reason


it be exactly what i said father
when jonathan first get into
trouble
of course they have
good reason
hush up how
gordon die and how he son die

ben how could you side with the
enemy of you people

you mean you be prepare to sit
back and allow an injustice to be
do

he face grow
purple
it be you ben who talk about
injustice
man who teach
history at school
do you forget
what we people have suffer
under the english oppressor
now that we have at along last
come to power in we own land

now we be free to do to other
what they used to do to we
what
will you do if you be a black
man in this country today father

government be do for the black
it be a slow process ben
one of
these day the whole bloody lot of
they will be free and independent
in they own part of the land the

dorothy dear dorothy she be a
fantastic mother
in fact she have
two family i and she three
child in alexandra township

and this little girl grow up to be
a tough journalist
why a
journalist

sometimes i ask myself the same
question


alright
i will tell you
i be
bring up in a shelter way not
that dad be possessive not

the inquest be over mr
du Toit

not for i doctor
i have get to
know what happen to gordon


i only come home yesterday
after
three month in detention and now
i be banned and confined to the
house
there be nothing i can do
for you


i know it may be painful to you
doctor but i need to talk to you


how can i be sure you be not
actually send by they

ask emily
doctor we be in the
process of filing a civil claim
and you help be vital


come in


sit down

thank you for invite i in


the little girl on
he knee
what do you want to know

just one thing doctor
why do
you sign the state pathologist
report on the autopsy if you draw
up you own report as well


what make you think i signed dr
Jansens report

the report produced in court have
both you signature on it



impossible

what do you write in you report


dr
jansen and i do not disagree
on the fact
after all we
examine the same body in the same
time
but just on the
interpretation
for example if
gordon have really be hang
the mark on he throat would have
be concentrated on the front
he touch his
larynx
but in this case the bruise
be more obvious on the side


something else really upset i
perhaps it be not important

what be it


you see through a misunderstand
i arrive at the morgue too early
for the autopsy
there be not a
soul around except a young african
attendant
when i told he i would
come for the autopsy he let i in
the body be on the table dressed
i notice blood on the clothes

and then


as i examine the clothes more
closely a policeofficer come in
and said i be not allow in the
morgue before dr
jansen arrive
when i return with dr
jansen
half an hour later the body be
naked


doctor we have already get the
african attendant affidavit
he
testify that capt
stolz ordered
he to burn the clothes
do you mention what you said in
you report


of course
i find it most odd

doctor Hassiem would you be
prepared to put that in write


please excuse i for a minute


this be i report
i only have
one copy

you have a copy of the report


i know how to hide thing from the


mr
du Toit




i hope you have as secure a place
as i have

with an accomplice
smile
i think so

with expansive
gesture
take a pew man

sitting and
excite
we have it stanley

that mean stanley

it be not the first time that
a black member of the police have
lost he life in the service of

disgust

price of we effort to clear
gordons name

hey

we must keep going even more so
now
and for every bloke who be
going to die of bloody natural
cause in they hand
and for
we child future

i know
if i can no longer
believe that right be on i side
if i can no longer believe in
imperative to go on what will
become of i stanley


we be all make of flesh and
blood mr
du Toit we have all
get we flaw
and if a man like
to sample the grass on the other
side of the fence well that be
he own business
but it would
be unpleasant if people find out
about it especially if he be a
teacher
