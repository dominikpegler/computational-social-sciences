filling station business
he be
one of those young man that we run

i be sure
you have run across they that do not
deserve the thing he have
one of
those thing be he beautiful
bride sarah
she be a georgia
peach
as a matter of fact she
look more like the picture i have
have in i head than any woman i have
ever see
i take it upon myself to
take she away from john Liggit
hunter who do not deserve she
i be
not sure if i mention that he be
a frenchman who claimed to be an
englishman
it take some very
strong nylon cord to take she away
from he
she be a fighter as well
as a georgia peach

i do not know what to tell you
i be
sorry

that
he will not hardly talk to
anybody really
just certain
people
he be very trouble

shovel just make too goddamn
much racket

i do not think he be talk to a
woman in twentyfive or so year
that i know of anyway
that be why i
said to send a man
at least maybe
he would answer a question or two for a
man
i be all for helping the
college out believe i
it might
be a real good article or story

interviewer
just get i in the
room with he

melvin go get karl and take he
down to the old classroom

i will talk to he and see what we
can do

you see karl growing up only
know that sex be wrong and that
people who do it should be killed
for it
he could not really read
but well neither could his
mother
but he father make sure
that he mother know what the bible
said
and she make sure karl know
you know he sleep in a hole in the
ground under a toolshed right

i know he sleep in a toolshed

he mother told he that he be
they punishment
hers and he
father
from god for have sex

before they be marry

i do not think so
just period i
think
she told he
god give
they the ugly creation he could
think of
karl have an entire book
a notebook
on every page it say
franklin chapter verse number

he write that a few year ago
after he would learned to write
he
father name be franklin

that be really strange
what do it
mean

one of he Daddys bible lesson i
imagine
you all pull up a chair
i will go out and talk to he

you have to make something explode
to truly understand it
you have to
examine the tiny particle while
they be on fire

karl i get to take you down to the
old classroom
mr
woolridge have
some people for you to see down
there
come on

from that newspaper

about you release

and you should not
stare at he

how be i going to conduct an
interview if i can not ask he any
question

if he be
so troubled why be you letting
he out
what if he do it again
it happen all the time

he be free
he time up
that be
the rule
he be be treated and
reevaluated
he do not show any
sign any more

sign

homicidal sign
oh we be going to
change the light in here for karl
i hope you can see to write

you will have to step outside

i will not
take any picture i promise
i
just want to listen

no madam
i be sorry you can not

you can not smoke in here
i be sorry

well i reckon what you be a
wanting to know be what i be do
in here
i reckon the reason i be in
here be because i killed somebody
but i reckon what you be a wanting
to know be how come i to kill
somebody
well i reckon i will start
at the front and tell you
i live most of i life out behind
i mother and father house in a
little old she would and i daddy
build for i
they do not too much
want i up there in the house with
the rest of they
i mostly just set
around out there in the she would all
the time a lookin at the ground
it do not have no floor but i have
i a hole dig out to lay down in
and a quilt or tow that i put down
there
i daddy be a hard workin man
most of he life not that i can
say the same fer myself
i most
just set around the she would and
tinker around with a lawn mower
or two and go to school off and
on from time to time but the
child there make quite a bit of
sport of i make fun of i quite a
bit
some of they rough i up
sometimes so mostly i stay out
back there in the she would
i daddy
worked down at the sawmill there
down there at the plane mill for
an old man named dixon
old man dixon be a very cruel
feller he do not treat his
employee very well do not pay they
much of a wage do not pay i daddy
much of a wage just barely enough
to get by on
but i reckon he get
by all right they come out one or
the other of they usually i
mother and feed i pretty regular
at least i know he make enough for
i to have mustard and biscuit
three or four time a week
old man
dixon have a boy named jesse dixon
jesse be really more cruel than
he daddy
he make quite a bit of
sport of i and takened advantage
of the little girl around the
neighborhood quite a bit
he used to say i mother be a very
pretty woman
he said it quite a
bit from time to time when i be
at the school house
well i reckon
you want i to get on and tell you
what happen so i reckon i will tell
you
i be settin out in the she would
one evenin not do too much
just kindly starin at the wall and
a waitin fer i mother to come out
and give i i bible lesson and i
heared a commotion up in the house
there so i get up and run up on the
screenedin porch there to see what
be a going on and i look in the
kitchen window and i see i mother
a layin there on the floor without
any clothes on
and see jesse dixon a layin on
top of she have he way with she
well i just see red
i picked up
a kaiser blade that be a layin
there by the screen door some
folk call it a sling blade i
call it a kaiser blade
it be just a
long handle like a axe handle with
a long blade on it that be shaped
kind of like a banana
sharp on one
edge and dull on the other
it be
what the highway boy use to cut
down weed and whatnot
i go in the kitchen there and i
hit jesse dixon up side the head
with it and knock he off i
mother
i reckon that do not quite
satisfy i so i hit he again in
the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut he head off
kill he
well i mother she
jump up from there and start
yellin what do you kill jesse
fer
what do you kill jesse fer

well come to find out i mother
do not really mind what jesse be a
do to she
i reckon that make i
mad than what jesse have make i
i takened the kaiser blade some
folk call it a sling blade i
call it a kaiser blade and hit i
mother up side the head with it an
killed she
some folk have ask i if i have it

place

for a great long while
they have
see fit to put i out now

and read book to each other with a
flashlight
she do not want to have

other people because i do not have
any money
well mama and i i
mean
she seem to like i a whole
lot when we be out here though

dentist so they be rich

enough
to scrape by on i reckon

they still around you folk

i mother dead
i daddy
pose to be around still
he
do not want to have nothing to do
with i though

how do you know

he never do want to
i figure he
be not changed he mind much

how do you mama die

you do not need to know all of that
you be just a boy
you need to think about good
thought while you be still a boy
they will be plenty of time for the
other

i have have a lot of bad thought
since i daddy die
sometimes i
wish i be still real little and he
be still here
i mama real
good but i wish i have both of they
when we go to memphis one time in
the car it be rainin so hard we
could not see the road
but i wadnt
scare because i think as long as
daddy be drivin nothing could
happen to we
i feel that way about
mama now
he look at the ground
for a moment
mama have a boyfriend now
he name
be doyle hargraves
he work
construction so he make a pretty
good livin
he still do not help
mama out with any money though
he
be not no good
he be mean to she
he
do not like i at all
mama say
it be because he be jealous i belong
to i daddy instead of he
he
stay with we all night sometimes
but he be get he own house
somebody told i it be so he can
still have other girlfriend
i
like it on the night when he be not
at we house
i be not so nervous
then

how come she to keep bein
girlfriend and all with he if
he be mean to she

she say it be for the time when
he be good to she
she be lonely
since daddy die
she said
sometimes she do not know why
he threatened to kill she if she
ever left he
i daddy would kill
he if he be here and somebody be
mean to mama
vaughan he be real
good to mama
vaughan that you meet
but he be not able to do anything to
doyle he be funny you know
not
funny ha ha funny queer
he like
to go with man instead of woman
that make he not to be able to
fight too good
he sure be nice
though
he be from st
louis
people
who be queer can get along well
in a big town
he get transferred
here to work
but mama said the
real reason he left be because he
daddy hated he
for bein the way
he be
i wish he liked to go with
woman
i would rather he be mama
boyfriend than doyle

karl
you know when i said daddy get hit
by a train

yeah i remember you atellin i
that

it be not the truth
he shoot hisself
with a shotgun on purpose

why do he do that reckon

because he do not have enough money
to take care of we the way he
wanted to
that be what the letter
said
he get laid off from work and
have to just work odd job
i
think he take care of we fine
karl do you really kill somebody

yeah i do

who do you kill

two people

be they bad people

i think they be

maybe they needed it

i grow up and get taught it be not
right to kill nobody

it be okay if you be lookin out for
yourself
if it be selfdefense
be
it selfdefense

i daddy be good
i think too many
good people die
it be not right
that be what i think

stay with these folk

i guess i will put it right out on
the table
where do i start
linda
and frank be very important to i
they be like family
i own family
be never like family
they be
horrible people
as a matter of
fact i pray every night for year
that i father would die
i finally
realized through a lot of therapy
that i be wasting i energy on
hate he
now i just do not care
you see you and i be a lot alike
strange as that may seem
i mean
not physically or even mentally
really just well maybe
emotionally or actually the hand
we have be deal in life
we be
different
people see we as be
different anyway
you be well
you have you affliction or
whatever and i well mine not as
easy to see
i be just going to say
it
i be gay
do that surprise you
that i be gay
you know what be
gay be do not you

i reckon not

homosexual
i like man
sexually

not funny ha ha funny queer

well that be a very offensive way to
put it
you should not say that
you
be taught that be not you

i have hear it said that way

anyway it be hard to live gay
that be the right way to say it in
a small town like this
i have wanted
to leave many time but i love
for linda and frank and another
certain person that we will not go
into have keep i from it
anyway
i be ramble
if you be going to
live in the wheatly garage you need
to know that it will not be easy
doyle be a monster
not just a
close minded redneck but a
monster
dangerous person
i have
told linda that one day that man be
going to really hurt she or that
boy
maybe even kill one of they
i
see it in he eye
i be very in
tune maybe even psychic
doyle
will make you life hell
you be a
perfect target
when i first see
you i be afraid of you
not really
afraid i guess just taken aback
but also i feel a real sensitive
feeling from you
and for some
reason frank have adopted you
much
like a stray animal
i be sorry i
do not mean it like that
in a good
way
anyway i just want you to
know what you be in for
i have a
good feel about you
you be good
for frank
maybe it be that he can
have an adult friend on a childes
level
i be sorry i do not mean it in a
bad way
there be one more thing
it be none
of i business why you be in the
state hospital
everyone have
something in they past maybe you
tried suicide maybe you do
something terrible
but what i
see before i be a gentle simple
man
all i want you to promise i
be that you be capable of be
around linda and frank
you know
you would never hurt they under any
circumstance would you

i would not never hurt they

that be what i think
i hope i
have not offended you in any way
you seem like a thinker
you seem
to always be in deep thought
tell
i something
what be you think
right now

i be thinkin i could use i
another helpin of these potaters

oh

before that i be thinkin it would be
good if i could get another three
or four can of that pot meat if
you get any extry

how come karl will not eat here with
we

what exactly do you mean by that
i
do not understand

exactly the point i young
levelheaded friend

i do not get it

i rest i case

morris be real smart with
philosophy and thing
that be why
he and i be the songwriting team
of we group
i make up good tune
or melody as we call they and
morris be the lyric

not unlike gary brooker of the
protocol harum

we do not ever play any song that
you all write
i never even hear one
of they
you all just talk

we do not even play any song with
word at all that i remember
we
be not get no fuckin microphone
or
speaker set up

we write one last night standin
outside MiniMart
morris called it
stuart drive a comfortable car

then you know like on country
song in parenthesis it say there
be usually someone in the trunk
i
come up with a tune just humming

see vaughan you should not question
a genius
morris be a modern day
poet like in the old day

we late composition be as
follow
entitled
the thrill
i stand on the hill
not for a thrill
but for a breath
of a fresh kill
never mind the man
who contemplate
do away with license plate
he stand alone anyway
baking the cooky of discontent
by the heat of a laundrymat vent
leaving he soul
then like in poetry i have dot dot
dot then drop down to the next line
kind of off center

leaving he soul part water
under the medulla oblongata
of
mankind


i do not think that be right
i
believe dot dot dot come between
medulla and oblongata or something
like that
well it do
it wadnt before
mankind i know that much

the dot be where i say they be
melody and tune
that be you trade
you be a tunesmith terence

i do not really understand the
meaning of the word

if you all do not shut up i be going to go
out of i mind
and plus you be
liable to bust a spring in karls
head
he be already off balance

that wadnt the way you make it up
before morris
that be all i know

we do not need fancy word we need
to practice
we do not ever
rehearse

we need some payin gig instead of
just messin around on first one
patio and then another

morris you should just be the
manager you can not play nothing
anyway

we do not have a goddamn band
you all
just shut the fuck up
we do not
need no practicin or manager
because we be not no fuckin band
morris be not no genius and the rest
of you be just loser
be i the
only one sane human bein around
here
just get the hell out of i
house and do not come back

it be not you house doyle it be
Lindas

i will see you bill

okay stop back by
do not worry
about you boy here he be do
good

hit be not get no gas in it

see there
think of the simple
thing first

so karl do you intend to stay in
the lawnmower business for a while
or do you have other plan

i reckon

i think karl be going to be a
writer or a librarian eventually
you should see all the book he
have
he must read constantly

i be not read they yet except two or
three of they
i can not understand a
lot of what i try to read
i mind
hit wonder off to something else
when i try to read

i be the same way
of course in i
line of work i stay too busy to
read
but at least i have job security
people may stop do a lot of
thing but one thing be for sure
they will not stop dying

why do not we talk about something a
little more festive

do everyone like the food

good
i have not decided yet if i be
a good cook

hey karl you know what
melinda
be vote employee of the month at
the dollar store last february
be not that something

yes madam i reckon

well when you like pricing item
as much as i do i guess it be just
bound to happen sooner or later

karl maybe you and melinda might
want to take a walk or something
after dinner
it be a nice night

vaughan do not get pushy

i be sorry

i like walkin quite a bit from
time to time

i stay on i foot all the time at
work
i just can not find shoe
that be comfortable

hospital shoe might be the answer
nurse shoe

or the kind old lady who work in
the school cafeteria wear

same difference

i get real mean when i foot hurt
it be the only time i do not like
checkin out the customer when i
foot hurt

frank you and karl be not talkin
much you boy must really like
that food

i just do not have anything to say
about shoe

listen everybody i know this may
sound corny i have have a few glass
of wine and that kind of make i a
little emotional but i be going to
say it anyway
it just come over i
in a rush
i want you all to know
that i care about each and every
one of you at this table

that be very sweet of you vaughan
we care about you too
do not we
you all

also melinda please do not tell
anybody at the store that albert
be here tonight okay

why

well a lot of people in town talk
and spread cruel rumor
unfortunately i have to keep
certain part of i life private

you mean about you all bein together
in that way

yes

i think everybody at the store
know that already
they always
talk about it
maureen ledbetter
tell a awful story about why you
be not allow over at the first
baptist church no more

karl why do not you and melinda go
take a walk

all right then

you walk fast do not you

i reckon

these be the bad shoe i own for
walkin

and i do not try to touch she

Foolin around
sex and all

that be real good
you ort not to if
you be not marry to somebody
bible
tell you that much
hit tell some
thing that do not seem right too i
reckon
i guess a feller ort to
foller it close as he can though
you do not touch yourself do you

what do you mean

pull on you works
you private

oh jackin off

yes sir
you ort not know that
language

i do not know till here while back
a year or two ago when i spent the
night with ronnie smart one time
he said just tug on you peter and
think about you mama
i tried it
but i feel funny thinkin about i
mama
so i switched over to
thinkin about he mama and then
what he told i would happen
happen
it sure tingle do not
it

you ort not to pull on yourself
that away

i kind of like you tellina i what
to do and not to do
just like i
daddy
i do not mind he tellina
i
i hate doyle to tell i what to
do
mama said the only way to ever
get away from he be for he to get
away from we
that we can not leave
he or he will try and hurt she

he be not no count

you do not seem like a daddy
you
seem like a brother
wonder what make you like somebody
right off when you do not even know
they like what happen with i and
you

i do not reckon i know

and then some people you do not like
right off
it be funny
you know why i want you to play
ball with i

naw

because it be fun
it do not matter if
you be not no good
it take you
mind off of everything else while
you be do it
when you run real
fast tryin to make a touchdown you
do not think about anything else
i
be not no good but i daddy always
said he be proud of i when i
threw a ball or run with it
do
you have any brother and sister
growin up to play with

i have one there for little bit
hit
do not get old enough to play with

why not
it die

yeah

why

hit be borned a little too early
on
i mother and father make hit
come too early some way or other
i
reckon they changed they mind
about have another
i be about
six or eight year old then and they
do not care too much for i so i
reckon they do not need something
else to worry they with

so it die when it come out

i daddy come to the she would out back
and get i and said throw this here
away and hand i a towel with
something in it
i go for the
trash barrel there and opened up
the towel to see because they be a
noise and something movin in it
hit be bloodylike around that
towel
hit be a little ol bitty
baby no big than a squirrel

it be alive

yes sir
right then it be

boy or girl

little ol boy

you threw it in a trash barrel

i do not feel right about do
that
i takened a shoe box from
there in the she would and emptied out
some screwdriver and nut and
warshers from it and put the little
feller in that and bury he in
the corner of the yard there
that
seem more proper to i i reckon

it be still alive when you bury
it

i heared it cryin a little through
that box

that do not seem right
it seem
like you should have keep he alive
and take care of he if he be you
brother

i wadnt but six or eight
i reckon
i do not know what to do
i do not
know how to care for no baby
mama
and daddy do not want he
they
learned i to do what they told i
to
these day i figure it might of
be good to give he right back to
the good lord right off the bat
anyhow
