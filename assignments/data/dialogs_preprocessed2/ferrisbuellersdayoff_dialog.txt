it be nice to know i have such
love caring parent

i hope you feel good pumpkin

get some rest



we love you sweetie

call if you need we

they buy it





incredible
one of the bad performance
of i career and they never doubt it
for a second
what a beautiful day

parent always fall for the clammy hand
it be physical evidence of illness
it be
a good nonspecific symptom
parent be
generally pretty hip to the fever scam
and to make they work you have to go a hundred
and one hundred and two
you get a nervous
mother and you end up in a doctor office
and that be bad than school

fake a stomach cramp and when you be
double over moaning and wail just
lick you palm
it be a little stupid
and childish but then so if high school
right

this be i ninth sick day with semester
if i go for ten i be probably going to
have to barf up a lung
so i absolutely
must make this one count



i do not care if you be fifty five
or seven everybody need a day off
now and then
it be a beautiful day
how can i be expected to handle
high school

i do actually have a test
that be not
bullshit

that i care about it be





it be on european socialism
i mean
really
what be the point
i be not
european
i do not plan to be european
so who give a shit if they be socialist
they could be fascist anarchist and it
still would not change the fact that i
do not own a car







not that i condone fascism
or
and ism
ism in i opinion
be not good
person should not
believe in an ism
he should
believe in himself
john lennon
said it on he first solo album
i do not believe in beatles i
just believe in i
good point
there
Afterall he be the walrus

i could be the walrus and i would still
have to bum ride off people

i be not very political
let i
put that into perspective



i uncle go to canada to protest
the war right
on the fourth of
july he be down with i aunt and he
get drink and told i dad he feel
guilty he do not fight in viet nam
so i said what be the deal uncle
jeff
in wartime you want to be a
pacifist and in peacetime you want
to be a soldier
it take you twenty
year to find out you do not believe
in anything

ground
just like that
two week
be careful when you deal with old
hippy
they can be real touchy



i mother be a hippie
but she
lost it
she get old
if she listen
to the white album now
she do not hear
music she hear memory
nostalgia be
she favorite drug
it will probably be
mine too
i hope not



in eighth grade a friend of mine
make a bong out of one of these
the smoke taste like glue

he name be garth Volbeck
he be a
serious outsider
not a bad guy i
like he
i be probably he only friend
i do what i can for he
i mean if
i be he i would appreciate it
do unto other
right
anyway he mother own a gas station
he father dead and he sister rumored
to be a prostitute which be complete bullshit
she only put out so people will hang out
with she
it be sad but i do not hold it
against she
well to hold it against the
guy who use she and do not care about she
i parent never allow garth over here
it be because of he family
mainly he
old brother
he be in jail
i could see they
not wanting he brother here because he be
a register psycho
i would not want he here
i once watch the guy eat a whole bowl of
artificial fruit just so he could see what
it be like to have he stomach pumped
but garth be not he brother
it be not he fault
that he brother screwedup
alot of fight
with the parent on that point
i always feel
for garth
i be sleeping at he house once
and i be laying on the dark worrying that
he brother be going to come in and hack i
to death with an ax and i hear garth crying
i ask he what be wrong and he said nothing
nothing be wrong
there be no
specific thing he be crying about
in fact he be not really even aware that
he be crying
he just cry himself to
sleep every night
it be a habit
the
guy so conditioned to grief that if
he do not feel it he can not sleep
how
could you possibly dump on guy who have to
deal with that kinda shit
i parent
acknowledge the trudge of the situation
and i be sure that deep down they do feel
for he but still the guy banned from
we house

unfortunately now i parent have a
legit argument
garth do not need his
brother to give he a rep anymore
he be
get one on he own
he be lost
it be
over for he
he be eighteen
go from
school
go from life
he legacy be
a gas station




one very serious danger be playing
sick be that it be possible to believe
you own act



that and boredom
alot of people
ditch and feel great for about an
hour
then they realize there be
nothing to do
and food
i myself
have ditch and get so bore i
do homework
figure that shit out

you have to plan thing out before
you take the day off
otherwise
you get all nervous worrying about
what to do and all you get be grief
and the whole point be to take it
easy cut loose and enjoy

you blow you day and at about three
of the clock when everybody out of school
you be going to wish you would go to
school so you could be out have
fun

avoid the misery
plan you day
do it right



there be alot of pressure at work
in i age group
and it be not always
recognized

some guy whose hair be falling out
and he stomaches hanging over his
belt and everything he eat make
he fart he look at someone like
i and think this kid young and
strong and have a full rich future ahead
of he what be he get to bitch about







that be just one reason why i need a
day off every now and then





food
shelter
no
yes

hello

cameron
what be happening

very little

how do you feel

shred

be you mother in the room

she be not home
where be you

home

dressed and come over

it be all in you head
come on over



i feel like complete shit ferris
i can not go anywhere

i be sorry to hear that
now come
on over and pick i up

i be dying

you be not die
you just can not think
of anything good to do



if anybody need a day off it be
cameron
he have alot of thing to
sort out before he graduate
he
can not be wind this tight and go
to college
he roommate kill
he
i have come close myself
but i
like he
he be a little easy to
take when you know why he be like he
be
the boy cannot relax
pardon
by french but cameron be so tight
that if you stick a lump of coal up
he ass in two week you would have a
diamond
and cameron would worry that he would
owe tax on it

regardless of how much shit sister

you how gross they act or how wicked
and insensitive they can be you should

they have cash and it be usually very easy

a dream of mine to be on the radio
i have what i consider to be an excellent
broadcast voice
i practise it in the
bathroom all the time
i used to play
record and do introduction to they
but i have never have the chance to sit
behind a microphone and try it out
for real

groove right now

go to another

be it
as much as we like each other
the process of growing up will
separate we

i would
this be not
just teenage infatuation
that be what i
parent call it

he like shit because he be going to
kiss she ass for giving he what he be
builtup in he mind as the endall
beall of human existance
she will not
respect he because you can not respect
someone who kiss you ass
it just
do not work

conventional wisdom would suggest
a visit to the near trauma
center

i wish
you would come in

surgery
fire

of the car or be it a combination
of everything shitty in you life

you just can not deal with anymore
shit
the car take you into the
red zone
time for a reality check

cameron
i could flip real easy too
there be nothing wrong with it
at one
time or another everybody go to
the zoo

basically

then you problem be you

excuse i

excuse you
you oughta spend a little
more time dealing with yourself and
a little less time worrying about
what you brother do
it be just
an opinion

there be somebody you should talk
to

if you say ferris bueller you lose
a testicle

you know he



the whole time i be just think

i be think about the future
and i realized it do not make
and difference if the present
go to shit
