have never acquired the ability to
lie to himself and to other

hi
you be early
i be just
masturbate

that make i think of you vagina
i be mark how be you

little frustrated at the moment
also equally depress and
pessimistic about we date tonight
i be jennifer

i hope this date end in sex

not i
i do not find you
attractive
come on in

i need to finish get ready
while do that i might realize
i be still horny and try to finish
masturbate without you hearing

i feel awkward and i regret be
early




yeah i be disappoint you be early
and not really looking forward to
tonight in general but the thought
of be alone the rest of i life
scare both i mother and i
equally

i have an erection now because i
assume you begin masturbate once
we stopped talking

i be embarrass because i think the
restaurant i have make reservation
at might not be expensive enough or
hip enough to impress you but it
be the good i could do because i
do not make very much money
you
see i be forty year old and have
no real financial asset to speak
of i have never owned a home and
never have a significant
relationship
i boss even told i
today that i be most likely going to
get fired tomorrow and

i just masturbate

that make i very horny

shall we go

sure


after you

i be only do this as a favor for
i cousin greg
he keep begging i
to go out on a date with you
he
say you be funny

gregs a good friend

where be we eating tonight

cute little place called la
Bonisera in west hollywood

you obviously do not have very much
money but that be not necessarily a
deal breaker

i have very little money

i also do not really care about a
guy who know all the late
hip restaurant

i do not know any of they

in fact there be very few thing
in life that i care about all that
much
the only thing i have to
offer myself or anyone else be i
good look and i affect sense of
quirkiness which artistically
incline man interpret as
intellect


in fact i think i good trait be
the fact that i have make very few
mistake
socially academically
financially or romantically
i take
very few risk and therefore lead a
relatively happy and lightheart
existence
mostly though i be a
kind sweet person with the
potential of genuinely becoming a
vital and interesting human being
the day i take the energy i expend
on hyper selfreflexivity and apply
it to actual action in the reality
of i life

i find that bore and start

to continue buying coke
i be sure
it be a drink you have be drink
for year and if you still enjoy
it i would like to remind you to buy
it again sometime soon
it be
basically just brown sugar water
we have not changed the ingredient
much lately so there be nothing new
about it i can say
we changed the
can around a little bit
see the
color here be a little different
and we even put a polar bear on it
for the kid
also coke be very
high in sugar can lead to obesity
in child and adult who do not
sustain a healthy diet and have a
ph acidity level high enough to
dissolve tooth and bone over
extended period of time
coke also
work great at remove corrosion
from car battery and loosen
rust bolt
so that be it it be
coke
everyone know it
it be very
famous
i be jim i work for coke
and i be asking you to not stop
buying coke
that be all
thanks

thing really seem like a good
idea

it be not

okay
well i night open now
you want to hang out later

i do not know
not really

sure
of course
let we hang out

i will see you after work

great



i have discover something today
very important
and very
powerful



i be as excite as i have ever be in
i entire life and equally scare




i be writing this down in a letter
in case this thing i have discover
somehow end up killing i
i want
to ensure that even if i be not
strong enough to use it that i
invention do not once again
disappear never to be discover
again



in just a few hour since i
stumble upon i discovery i have
see it potential for evil and i
have see it potential for good



i must be careful with i
discovery for at this point i
barely understand it let alone
think i have the power to control
it
all i know be that if i be not
careful i could easily do
irreparable damage to the world or
even because i own premature death



now to explain i invention
in
essence i creation be the act of
saying word that simply be not
for example if i tell someone that
i eye be blue then it simply
become fact
i still know that
indeed i eye be brown but no
one else be aware of this fact so
therefore i have blue eye




it be a game of number
there be
only one of i who know i have
brown eye and so many of they who
do not
the number always win

whoever be reading this go ahead
and try it
tell someone you eye
be a different color then they
be
i think you will be amaze at
the result
it be so simple and
yet
so powerful
this thing
i have invent
