McCOY
oh yes sherman do explain it

McCOY
yes
you mother and i really

build a road or a hospital and you
need a lot of money
well you
issue a bond

do you build road

McCOY

here
let i try
darling daddy
do not build road or hospital
or anything really
daddy just
handle the bond for the people
who raise the money

that be what he said
bond

yes
see just imagine that a
bond be a slice of cake
now you
do not bake that cake but every
time you hand somebody a slice of
that cake a little bit come off
little crumb fall off
and you be
allow to keep those crumb




crumb
really

McCOY
and many a man have sell he soul
for those little crumb

yes
and that be what daddy do
he pass somebody else cake
around and pick up the crumb
but you have to imagine a lot of
crumb
and a great golden cake
and a lot of golden crumb
and
you have to imagine daddy run
around picking up every little
golden crumb he can get he hand
on
that be what daddy do

well you can call they crumb
if you want to

that be the good i can do

faint notion that soon he name

that he fate would be inextricably
bound to i own destiny

nudge peter awake and put three drink into peters
hand
peter stagger away from the bar carrying the
drink

thru thru



reading




get out of a taxi and walk into


be talking to the doorman as sherman approach

ah
mr
mccoy

hello tony

eddie sir

right
what be

these gentleman

sorry to bother you
i be
detective martin
this be
detective goldberg
we be
investigating an automobile
accident
maybe you hear about
it



martin hold up a copy of the city light article

oh yes yeah
on television
last night
we said i wife
said good lord we have a
mercedes and the license start
with an


you and a lotta people

oh really
the elevator arrive

be you going up sir

ah
well
yes
sure
would
you
do you

be this a bad time

no
no
not at all
come up
yes



we just need to ask a few
question

sure
yes
go ahead

so
let we see
can you tell we
if you car be in use the night
this happen

when exactly be it

tuesday a week ago

i do not know
let i think
i would
have to figure




anybody else use you car

i wife
sometimes
and the
people at the garage

park garage

yes

you leave the car with the key
and they park it

well
yes

could we go there and take a look
at it
the elevator stop
the door open


unlock the apartment door

the car

yes

now

soon as we leave here
we could
take a look
there be thing
that be consistent with an incident
like this
we do not find those
thing we move on down the list
and we be out of you hair


lead martin and goldberg inside

so you want to take a look at the
car then




yeah

i see

we do not have a description of a
driver
so we get to look for the
car
and that mean bother a
lot of innocent people
we be
sorry about the inconvenience
but it be a routine sort of thing

i understand
but if it be a
routine well i should i guess
i ought to
well follow the
routine that be appropriate to i
to someone with a car in this
situation
you see
martin and goldberg look at each other
then they follow
sherman into



no
i do not follow

well i mean if you have a
routine in an investigation like
this i do not know how these
thing work but there must also
be a routine for a person like i
an owner of a car with a license
number i think that be what i
need to consider
the routine

we just want to look at the car

that be what i mean
you see

no

excuse i mr
mccoy
but be there
something you want to tell we
rev





well i
how do you mean

because if there be now be the
time to tell we
before thing
get complicate

no
i just think
i think that
just to be sure certain safe
i think

let i put it this way if you
want to cooperate that be great
if you have reason for not
cooperate then i should tell
you that you do not have to say
anything
that be you right
if
you want you can say nothing at
all
you also have the right to
an attorney
i mean for that
matter if you lack the fund
for an attorney the state would
provide you with one free of
charge
if that be what you
wanted
goldberg sit down on the edge of shermans desk

well look
i guess what i should
do be i should
i should talk
this over with an attorney



be moving fast as he talk with martin and goldberg

but mainly it be the look on
he face
be not that the truth
marty

yeah
all of sudden the bitch
start coming out of he

so i read he he right as
casual as i can do it
rev




and then he sit down on the guy
desk

Whatd he do

nothing at first
but he be
confuse
and he eye be get
big and he be doubletalking like
a son of a bitch
i be think
there be something there





as they reach weiss

i think we get he

get who
what do you get

well

mccoy

do this put an end to this white
justice shit
ray Andruitti interrupt he
rev




abe
we get zip on this guy

i think he be the type we could
smoke out
bring he in for
questioning
go public

go public
you get nothing here
you only witness be in a hospital
likely to die
do not listen to
this shit abe
you get to get
to manhattan
you get a speech
to make

i will tell you what you get to do
sir
you have get to send a signal
out to the poor people of this city
you get to let they know that
justice be blind
you get to let
they know that if you be white and
rich you get the same treatment
you get when you be black and poor
you get to give people hope

you mean we nail the wasp

to the wall

i like this man
i like he
look
what be the kid condition
any chance he will regain
consciousness

what if he do
he can not talk
he be breathing from a tube down
he throat

no
but maybe he can point

point
rev





yeah
i get an idea
we take a
picture of sherman mccoy over to
the hospital to this kid
and
three or four other guy white
guy and we put they by the bed
the picture
and the kid come
to
and he point to mccoys
picture
and he keep pointing
nobody believe what they be hearing except kramer

might work
that might work
it be
a long shot but it might work
an rush up to kramer and pull he aside

mr
kramer

yeah
what do you want

you will kill he
he wake up out
of a coma and see four white man
in suit and tie stare at he
from the end of the bed he will
shit and die

it be worth a try

i do not believe what i be hearing
some poor gook with a tube down
he throat pointing at a picture
that be you case
it be never
going to stand up

i know that ray
i know that
i just want to bring the guy in
just bring he in
that be all
we get the press
we get the
attention
then we can relax and
do the right thing

look at i abe

that
no way

in damage will certainly make
you grief more comfortable

well yes i could use a few
thing reverend thank you
i
be worried about i clothes for
instance
i feel that the
presentation of i person should
be carefully design
as a model
to black mother everywhere i
think i should have the right
wardrobe
so if you could have
mr
Foxs limousine pick i up in
the morning i could do some
shop

why certainly

i will need some furniture too
and a new refrigerator
and although i should probably
continue to live in that shithole
of an apartment at least until
after the lawsuit be settled i
would like to start looking now
for a coop in manhattan for i
and i son something with a view
of the river and preferably in a
neighborhood that be at least
upwardly mobile
pause as they all look at she
rev





how could i turn i back on the
plight of this grief stricken
woman
how could i turn i back
on a profitable relationship
i
be touched to the depth of what
be left of i soul
and i bank
account
