4.5,"So here we are with another attempt to make a feature length film of Frank Herbert's Dune, one of the biggest sci-fi novels that has left massive impact on the genre.

4.5,"Denis Villenueve regala una experiencia extrasensorial con esta película, una obra maestra disfrazada de relatos clásicos conjuntados para formar ""Dune"", la obra de 1965, que con la visión de Villenueve presenta de muy buena manera un surrealista relato mesiánico con una acción impactante desde el apartado visual, con alegorías muy bien marcadas como la del Toro, que para mi representa la fuerza imparable vs la sensatez o la injustificada diferencia física y mental entre el hombre y la bestia, bestia que podría tomar varias caras, ya sea política o subconscientemente en el humano, la búsqueda por el poder y la tan marcada supremacía humana. Que para mi es lo que representa la película , la dualidad entre la clase monopolizada mente autonombrada realeza con la gente de abajo, dualidad que se subraya en el 1 y 3 acto, mientras en el 1 acto nos muestran la cara de la política por la que se rigen los personajes principales con un cambio abrupto en el 3 acto con la guerra, el régimen del Pueblo. El vestuario en esta película forma gran parte de la interpretación de los actores, actores que desde su presentación son imponentes, mayor mente marcado en Dave Bautista y Stellan Skarsgard, ellos son impactantes desde su físico, no necesitan un arco de personaje en la historia su simple misticismo los vuelve interesantes y temibles, conjuntándose de muy buena manera con el resto del elenco, todos lo hacen increíble encarnando respectivamente su posición en la historia. Con Timothée Chalamet encarnando a un personaje oprimido por sus padres en una busqueda constante por el poder que no sabe si posee a pesar de ser catalogado como el ""mesías"" del relato, que junto a Zendaya que para mi representa la desconstrucción de la belleza interna y externa crean una conexión que aunque no estén en pantalla juntos en casi toda la película, las visiones tan bien metaforizadas en la historia crean una incertidumbre que se va alargando y desenmarañando en el desarrollo de la película culminando con una fantástica alegoría del personaje de Paul saliendo literalmente del hoyo y con ello también renaciendo simbólicamente de las cenizas de su imperio.

Para mi Dune es una película que está en el grupo de ""obras maestras"", crea una obra que desde el soundtrack que combina de excelente manera los sonidos ambientales con la profunda banda sonora de Hans Zimmer puedes notar el peso simbólico que solo un director con la precisión de Villenueve puede crear, esta obra bien puede ser una crítica Capitalísta y a sus consecuencias de la anarquia del Comunismo y su inevitable caída o una simple monopolización de las obras clásicas expolotadas a la máximapotencia para crear una narrativa que conjunte a todas ellas. Dune es una experiencia al lado más introspectivo de la desconstrucción humana.",Daniel B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 28, 2022",Daniel B,/user/id/Google_103860718863837961196,RT,Google_103860718863837961196,

4.5,"This is the adaptation we've been waiting for for 50 years! The only way to successfully tell this story is to do it in a two-part film, and this is an excellent set-up to part two. I can't wait until it comes out!
Villeneuve succeeds where Lynch failed in so many ways. Let's get one thing out of the way at the very beginning: NO WEIRDING MODULES!! Using hand signals and subtitles instead of inner monologue was a nice touch as well.
The acting was superb! Having only ever seen Oscar Isaac in the Star Wars Sequels I was shocked at the depth of character he was able to put into Duke Leto. Jason Mamoa was the perfect Duncan Idaho (I would have liked to have seen the scene where he is drunk on spice beer), and I can easily believe him to be one of the most feared warriors in the Imperium. Timothée Chalamet, like Matthew Broderick in the previous generation, was able to convincingly pull off a younger character well enough so that the audience forgets the actor's actual age. 
One of the only issues I have with the film is the treatment of the redoubtable and dangerous Lady Jessica. The number of times she is portrayed as merely fearful and seemingly not in control of herself was insulting to the character as written in the novel. I don't blame this on the actress Rebecca Ferguson, whom I feel did an amazing job with what she was given. I put this at the feet of the director - and even this has a caveat. Her character may toughen up in the next installment.",Sean N,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 15, 2022",Sean N,/user/id/Facebook_1012523766,RT,Facebook_1012523766,

4.0,"Avec le sens du détail et l'amour de l'image de Denis Villeneuve, Dune : première partie ne pouvait être que réussi sur le plan visuel. Les scènes tournées à la lumière du jour, entre chien et loup, apportent une touche poétique et authentique qui manquent à beaucoup d'autres films aux effets spéciaux abondants. 

Ce premier film Dune ne dégrade pas les écrits de Frank Herbert, ce qui n'est pas chose aisée tant la complexité des intrigues politique et humaine peut être délicate à transposer, notamment lorsqu'il s'agit de montrer l'étendue des pouvoirs de Paul Atréides. 

Par ailleurs, les acteurs pour incarner Paul et Jessica auraient difficilement pu être mieux choisis ; Thimotée Chalamet et Rebecca Ferguson forment un tandem remarquable. En revanche, je n'en dirais pas autant sur le choix d'Oscar Isaac pour incarner le Duc Leto. Non que l'acteur soit mauvais, il lui manque une présence à l'image ; Liam Neeson aurait été un meilleur choix, je pense. Cela ne gâche pas son personnage pour autant.

If you know Dune, a remake was needed but not attempted because as of yet, there is no way to accurately recreate the world in the Books. Also, the last attempt, which was good just was to lengthy and the graphics where just not there yet. The rendition looked amazing, the acting compelling.

1.5,"It is a movie that would not deserve any comment, if it did not reflect all the vanity and downturn in which today's film industry has gone. From the director of the interesting ""Arrival"" (2016), through the failed ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Denis Villeneuve, we came to an impersonal remake of a much better achievement from 1984.

No need to spend too much words on the analysis of this work, because it seems that the story itself did not even interest the authors much. A simple recipe, copy everything that has already been filmed, stretch the already maximally compressed script to two or three potential sequels, pump in as large a budget as possible for CGI effects, insert a few actors (Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin), who would otherwise be ok, if they weren't here only just for decoration, in order to push up the ratings a little more, with the antipathetic and completely wrongly chosen main protagonists, who all together sadly failed.

The individual reassignment of gender/ethnicity of the minor characters from the book is not too irritating, although such choices are, for some strange (or perhaps not) reason, somehow always at the expense of quality. So, they are still irritating, because they are imposed. By the way, if the so-called gender (and any other) equality in cinema has already become the manner of the new age, it is interesting that no one ever replaces any original female character for a male one, if only as an experiment. I guess that would require a certain amount of originality and courage, qualities that are no longer appreciated by modern directors.

After watching this adaptation, it is only possible to love more the controversial 1984 Lynch's version, which, despite all the imperfections, still remains superior in every sense (I mean, of course, the shorter, original version, not the integral, which is much weaker).

The only positive thing that can be said about this film is that, unlike e.g. the long-announced ""Foundation"" series, which is a much bigger disaster in itself, at least holds the original story. And in any case, at least it doesn't come down to purchase of the title of some famous work in order to push someone's other untalented generic script for a story that no one else would ever look at.

The sense of scale that Denis is able to produce is just mind-boggling and he retains his class the whole time.

It was the simple fact that the whole story, plot, character introductions and largely the whole world-building is all being told as if you already are familiar with it. 
I'm guessing that if I'd read the books before watching I'd feel respected and as though Denis gave a little ‘nod' of «you know what all this is about». 
So that's why the second viewing actually was an amplified experience from the first, since all details of story and plot were settled and I had the time to capture more of the deeper meanings and thoughts behind the different scenes.

3.5,"To me, Dune series is the Bilble of sociopolitics, religious politics and a whole bunch of other kinds of human wisdom. Thus, I can't really forgive skipping the feast in Arrakeen or the missing Green Chamber.

This film reminds me to not pay TOO much attention to trailers. The trailers suggested another 2020s woke disaster which this film is not. Yes, Kynes was made into a black woman, but his role does not get ruined by it and this way all the woke checkboxes got compressed into the single scapegoat who was already the perfect candidate through being a planetologist.

My inner Dune Jihadi scoffs at the softened Atreides. The rest enjoys it. Humans in the Dune universe are already somewhat different from us, no need to overfocus on that.

The actress chosen to play Chani by method of woke checkboxes could not deliver the original, whose savagery hides behind an ""elfin face"" and who fancies Paul from the start. Again, an acceptable casualty since she was never an A-rank toon while Kynes alone would not have appeased the wokeness committee.

All in all, my feeling is that this as good as a 2020s adaptation of a classic work can have any remote chance to be.

4.0,"Director/Screenwriter Denis Villenueve (""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Arrival"") is a perfect fit for a story like ""Dune.""  Villeneuve has consistently crafted films that are captivatingly immersive cinematic experiences, sometimes short on story but always visually spectacular.  This ""Dune"" offers truly breathtaking visuals.  In fact, it's the best reason currently available for actually heading out to the movies.  Films like this can be best experienced only in a dark room with a huge screen, lightly populated with socially-distanced strangers who have turned off their cell phones (I'm looking at you, Row G).

Villenueve, along with co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, has created a mesmerizing world for the moviegoer to inhabit.  House Atriedes, long-time rulers of Caladan (a world filled with rainy days, fog and lush beauty – think Seattle, but a planet) is ordered by the Emperor to take control of Arrakis (known as ""Dune""), a barren wasteland of strategic importance because of the hallucinogenic ""spice"" harvested there.  (Spice is essential to interstellar travel, life extension and a variety of medical uses, all of which make it the most valuable substance in the world.)  Turns out, House Harkonnen, previous ruler of the planet, isn't thrilled to give up this lucrative enterprise.  Treachery abounds.  The leader of House Atriedes is murdered.  The heir, Paul Atriedes, barely escapes, but is abandoned to wander in the desert, just in case the messianic overtones were too subtle.

Although this film runs over 2 ½ hours, it covers only the first half of Frank Herbert's original novel by the same name.  Even at this length, creating a coherent narrative is a major achievement.  In contrast, in the 1970s Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jadorowsky created story boards for an epic film version of ""Dune"" with a running time of over ten hours.  Astonishingly, Hollywood wasn't interested.  It would have starred an amazing collection of characters including Orson Welles, Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, David Carradine, Herve Villachaize (the diminutive Tattoo on ""Fantasy Island"") and Gloria Swanson.  The lead would have been Jadorowsky's twelve-year-old son.  (If you're interested, watch the 2013 documentary ""Jadorowsky's Dune."")

Villenueve's script has stripped away the pretentious overtones and general bloviating of Frank Herbert's novel.  The original novel is a piece of work, in every possible sense.  Running to more than 550 pages, it was originally serialized in ""Analog"" magazine before being published by the little-known Chilton Books (a publishing house best known for its car repair manuals).  Herbert himself spent time in a socialist commune in Washington state as a child.  He was also a distant relative of Joseph McCarthy and admired his relation's goals if not his methods.  To suggest that his views are ""eclectic"" is to engage in serious understatement.

All this means that Villeneuve had to effectively navigate a dizzying range of topics that include ecology, psychedelic drugs, religion (featuring the Bene Gesserit – think extremely badass space-traveling nuns), authoritarianism and actual human emotion.   He succeeds for many reasons.  First, rather than spouting philosophy, he focuses on building a big, far-reaching spectacle that literally encompasses a universe. Second, he has an impeccable eye for casting.  In this case, he's selected Timothee Chalamet (""Little Women,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"") as the messianic son Paul Atriedes, Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission Impossible"" series, ""The Greatest Showman"") as his Bene Gesserit mother, Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina,"" ""The Card Counter"") as leader of the Atriedes clan and a supporting cast that includes Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Zendaya.  All inhabit their roles perfectly.  Finally, Villenueve understands that big ideas can arise and be considered without the need for mind-numbing exposition (that's right, Mr. Herbert) or tidy resolution.

""Dune"" has admirers from a surprisingly broad array of political perspectives, from Stephen Colbert to white supremacists attracted to the idea of a white messiah figure.  Since its publication in 1965, Herbert's weirdly compelling world has offered a welcome respite from the real.  It offers a similarly welcome, thought-provoking diversion today.",Mark H,False,False,False,True,4.0,"Aug 21, 2022",Mark H,/user/id/fc8e2b5f-f565-4a49-bd49-a6c34dcb3fee,RT,fc8e2b5f-f565-4a49-bd49-a6c34dcb3fee,

4.5,"Dune was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.

The story of Dune is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.

There is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today's blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.

The visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.

The acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crescendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted every time he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.

Dune delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.

Aside from Skarsgård , the biggest winner in this film is the cinematography and visuals, they are simply amazing and the big screen gives the greatest depth to how grand the visuals are. 
Bautista and Mamoa are fine, and stay within the confines of their limitation but the quality dips a little with their scenes which is understandable. 
Zendaya is very bland and has true limitation to what she can produce as an actor, but she is not in part 1 enough to bring momentum to a grinding halt. Which is my worry for part 2, as Herbert's book looks to the Fremen where we will probably see more of her.

3.0,"It's a pretty decent attempt but I feel like some of the main characteristics of the book were grossly overlooked.

Fremen were supposed to be a mystery but from the very start they were bad ass fighters who were attacking the Harkkonens. The absence of this startling discovery takes away a huge mystery and a large part of the political intrigue.

Liet and Kynes we're supposed to be two different people. Again an amazing mystery and discovery ruined from the get go. The gender swap of Kynes felt like pandering rather than a genuine effort to bring something to the story.

Chani was supposed to have red hair. The whole point was that she did not look like the other Fremen. I believe again this was done to pander to certain groups that ironically will not be the ones buying tickets.

It really felt like the rules of Gurney and Duncan should've been swapped by the actors. Gurney was the sloppy drunken warrior minstrel rescued from the imperial slave pits. Duncan was the stalwart soldier. But because Brolin is a much better actor it made sense for him to have the more involved role.

Jason Momoa playing himself, didn't really seem to fit here. Drax did a respectable job though. He still can't act, but he seems to be the top of the list of two of the most innovative directors of our day. 

Surprisingly good Paul was rounded out by a decent Leto and an absolutely perfect, amazing Lady Jessica. I still don't know why everybody goes gaga over Oscar Issac. He did an acceptable job but there's nothing great about the guy. I really preferred both William Hurt's and Jürgen Prochnow‘s interpretation. 

They did a very poor job indicating how Paul's consciousness was being expanded by the spice. It's more like I've been a Bene Gesserit force ghost whispering into his ear rather than him being able to see the proper paths in his future. 

I like the cinematography however the  Buildings vehicles and man-made environments seemed sparse and unfinished. We're talking about a feudal society that makes a great deal about ornamentation pomp and circumstance. 

There was not enough ambiguity in the Atreides motives. Yeah they're good guys relative to every other house, but they're still essentially royal aristocracy that uses and enslaves it's subjects. Much of their supposedly honorable behavior is based on good public relations rather than morality. And they address this in the books.

4.0,"I consider it necessary to start my review with the fact that I have not read the books, have not watched the adaptation of Lynch, and do not know the whole story of Dune, and therefore only the plot was shown to me in the film. And I can't fully judge her. In fact, the second part will decide everything, without which there will be no point in the first, so I really hope that there will be a sequel and I urge everyone to go to the cinema to see this film.

But if you still go deep, we can say that the picture has unconditional advantages in an atmosphere worthy of visuals with a relatively modest budget, scope, scale, directing (Villeneuve proved himself a long time ago), camera work, a soundtrack from Zimmer himself and an excellent cast.

However, there are also shortcomings, although they are noticeably smaller - this is another story about the ""chosen one"", the predictability of the plot and some burdensomeness of the film. And if typicality can be attributed to a half-century source, then in the last hour the film is really hard to watch.

After certain events in the film, which I will not name in order not to spoil, it seemed to me that the film would end there, that 2.5 hours had already passed, and I was about to get up from my chair, but the film went on and on. Of course, he did not pass in quality, but perhaps the book should still be divided into a trilogy, and not into two films.

Many people hastily call Dune the new Lord of the Rings in scope and significance - with which I cannot agree. Nor is it the next Star Wars, no. It's more like Game of Thrones in space. And how this story will turn out to be a cult, as I wrote at the beginning, depends almost entirely on the second part, which not only should be, but should reveal all the questions, while not losing in scope. And here again it all comes down to hoping for a sequel: will he put this franchise on a pedestal or will it, like past attempts at its film adaptations, sink into the sands of an endless dune ...", ,False,False,False,False,4.0,"May 29, 2022", ,/user/id/978328291,RT,978328291,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2500277866862554/picture

2.5,"Boring but artistic.

Dune introduces the audience to an interesting futuristic world that feels akin to sci-fi films from the late 1900s and early 2000s. Hans Zimmer composes an ethereal soundtrack that elicits nostalgia of classic sci-fi, and the visuals throughout the film create a beautiful and realistic-looking atmosphere. Though part of what breaks immersion is the blandness and emptiness of this entire world. The story focuses on several factions that are offered up as advanced societies, yet seem to be in the brink of extinction with how few of them there are.

However, where Dune falls flat is both in its narrative and character development. In two and a half hours, the narrative barely progresses, and it makes a large chunk of the film feel like unnecessary filler - that may change with its sequels, but as a standalone film, its a slog to go through.

Most of the film is about building the world and setting up the main conflict.

At times the movie might get dull and too expository, but it is usually covered up by its ambitious visual story telling. It isn't really a huge problem in my opinion. Some people might say Dune is boring. I didn't find it to be boring. The tension and conflict keeps rising which makes it very engaging.

4.0,"After departing from Middle-Earth and seeing the galaxy further distantly fading poetically while awaiting theatrical return to Pandora, there seems to be a need for another epic picture of singular, multi-chapter continuation to conquer the screens with open attractive invitation to attend the next chapter and the next. ""Dune"" not only delivers that return to the cinematically peaked genre by scale, but the grand tour de force gone beyond towards the history of past epics by learning from them honorably, especially demonstrating how to avoid contemporary epics' failures. Though there's still a convoluting vast that previously violently messed up somewhat surreally in the 1984 adaptation that stirred skepticism, but masterful director Denis Villeneuve enabled decrypted understanding and nuanced engagement with amazing technically achieved visionary and brilliant cast supporting the story to its truest, proper attentive form with riveting focus.

4.5,"When it comes to 'Dune', I definitely fall into the fan/enthusiast category. This is the 'Star Wars' of my youth. When I went to the original movie premiere, on December 14, 1984, I left the theater with a new found vigor. I felt compelled to learn more, and, through the many novels, I learned more than I ever thought was possible. Even as a child, I love tragic characters, and the world of 'Dune' is filled with them. When the Syfy channel released the multi-part, retelling of Dune,  on December 3, 2000, I was all in. Unfortunately, I didn't really like it. It just seemed to shiny and clean, which the books were not. Hollywood has a tendency to do that to stories. So when this film was released, I was expecting more shiny new stuff. To my surprise, I was wrong. Sooo wrong. This film was the gritty, dirty, sand in your shoes adaptation I was not expecting. A modern masterpiece, and I've watched it more times than I can count, which is not something that I normally do. While I wanted to see the entire tale, I think splitting the story up, into more than one film, was a great idea. The books are literary works of art, and great artists rarely produce just one piece. I can't wait to see the next chapter of this film.

0.5,"As a huge fan of Frank Herberts Dune (All of my online personas since the mid-90s have been Dune inspired names), having read all the books, seen all the movies and series I still can't let go of 1984's Dune.

I guess knowing all the background helps with where a lot of people get lost with the 1984 version and they lose the immersion that the music and acting provides.  Having seen Dune so many times on reruns on TV during my youth and young adult years, having owned it since I had my first VCR when I joined the military in the early 90s.

Dune 1984 is one of the few movies I can safely say I can watch and rewatch over and over.  I just didn't get the same feeling with this new version.  In fact it was so cringeworthy watching the forced horrible acting and rewrites from the writers, the mispronounced names and places, and the changes to the combat of the Atreides (I mean what the heck happened to the whole Weirding Module that was supposed to give the Atreides their whole leg up combat wise, which when employed by the millions of Fremen was supposed to be the game changer for the universe?

So much has been lost, and there was no reason to make 2 movies out of the original book...none other than just another cash grab.  I can't name one actor I liked in the new movie more than any actor in the original 1984 version.  More audience favorites designed to gather rave reviews, even though the movie itself sucked in comparison.

If they wanted to make new movies, go into the other books and tell the life of Muadib after he has defeated the Emperor.....or better yet go into some of the other races and planets and tell more of their story...rather than rehashing old ground that didn't need rehashing.

The movie is pretty much a shot for shot remake of that film... in fact half of it... the awkward ending leaves a lot to be desired, and with no clear indication that the next part of the movie will then follow on to the rest of the Dune saga, its hard to justify this as anything other than a labour of love for Villneuve.  Sonically, its a bit harsh and unless you spend extra money to watch this in a cinema armed with a fully working Dolby Atmos sound field, is going to be like watching it on TV.

4.5,"(DISCLAIMER) I have never read the books, nor have I watched the previous iteration. This review is purely based on the 2021 film.

Dune is a cinematic masterpiece. Every scene is immersive and was carefully crafted into perfection. Its cinematography, directing, costume design and set design are out of this world, but sound design and the score do stand out above all. Hans Zimmer truly is a masterclass of music and every bit of sound seems to take you directly into Dune's world.
However, I do need to point out that its plot feels incredibly slow. Maybe because the book was divided into two parts, and while that is great from a story-telling point of view, I was left wondering when something was actually going to happen.
Adapting a novel into the screens is never easy and Dune's complex world is no exception. Some characters felt like they could've benefited from more backstory for those of us who never read the books, namely the Baron.
Despite all of it, Thimothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson steal the show, enhancing their colleagues (also) stellar performances, as is expected of actors like Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem, to name a few.

4.5,"For you plebs, Dune is the Ravenclaw to Star Wars' Gryffindor, there. It's solemn and introspective, but gorgeous and casts a long shadow. Notoriously stubborn to adapt to the screen, the Sci-Fi novel-series staple is grand, dark, and can even be boring compared to the ""space westerns"" that make up such a formidable chunk of the genre. If I had my pick of any director to undertake Dune, I probably would've picked Villeneuve — although, I wouldn't mind seeing a Tim Burton-designed sandworm… It felt like this was the natural undertaking after Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. The movie is a visual marvel. Part of the charm of Dune is that it's futuristic (it takes place in 10191afterall), but is still rustic and rudimentary… somehow. An example comes in the form of combat. While guns, lasers, etc. do exist, a type of shield technology has rendered most of them ineffective. Therefore, the vast majority of the fighting occurs with good ol' hand-to-hand combat. The juxtaposition of ships capable of interstellar travel and soldiers dressed in armor carrying swords (real swords, not lightsabers) adds to the property's uniqueness. And if you like a handsome man in uniform, this is the movie for you. Oscar Isaac, Jason Mamoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Timothée Chalamet all armor-up in this one. With intricate storylines, sometimes you can get lost in the dialogue and keeping up with who is who — even with a 156-minute run time, there are a lot of characters to introduce and develop. The only disappointment was not seeing Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) dangling from the contraption that carries his fat ass around like a spider, the imagery of which as stuck with me in the book. Introducing Salusa Secundus, home of the Sardaukar, was the most visually intense scene. The sandworm devouring the gigantic ""spice"" collecting vehicle was quite the sight. I don't see Dune ever having the mass appeal of Star Wars, which is totally fine. It's special and should be loved for what it is. It looks like there'll be a much-deserved sequel.

Thrust into the middle of it all is Paul Atreides, a young man of royal lineage around whom the whole convoluted plot revolves; apparently, his actions will go a long way toward determining exactly who will end up with what. As Paul, Timothee Chalamet is thin, pretty, and brooding, with soulful eyes and an impressive shock of hair but (sadly) no spark at all.

4.5,"One simply cannot claim to have read the book and give this movie just half a star or say it is the worst movie ever. Any one who has read the book knows that bringing it to the big screen is almost impossible especially when 75% of the dialog is actually made of the thoughts the characters have and the appendix explaining all the background history and the lexicon is 25% of the original book. All the reviewers complaining about the lack of action they should read the section about Paul's and Jessica's escape and eventual meeting of Stilgar and his cohort in the desert. It is almost all about Jessica's internal recriminations, about her internal musings or fears about Missionaria Protectiva, or about Paul's visions about the coming Jihad, which he'd have rather nothing to do with if he could. The only action in this section worth at least 15% of the book, is them escaping, crossing the desert and Paul's fateful duel with Jamis.


Whoever has read the book would perhaps complain about the lack of insight into why the spice is so important, about how this ""Empire"" works, about who are the Bene Gesserit, why all the fuss with their superlative training or their Missionaria Protectiva, or the ins and outs of the Navigator's Guild. Or about how the Harkonens managed to break the Suk Doctor's Imperial Conditioning, an absolute pre requisite in their plan for destroying House Atreides.


Never mind all that. The movie is a great attempt at bringing Dune to big screen, mostly faithful to the actual text. Could the screenplay be better in reflecting the character of the book? Perhaps, but the book has many interconnected layers, including a strong religious one which may not sit well with some audiences.


Perhaps the only complaint I would have would be the sound editing. Perhaps Villneuve should avoid superimposing critical dialog with swelling musical scores or overwhelming sound effects. He's done that to some degree in his Bladerunner as well.

4.0,"I read the Dune novels (and many of the sequels) long before a movie was ever made. I will say this newest version is very artistic, visually arresting, and almost poetic.  However, it lacks the passion, energy and power of the 1984 version, which makes that one still my favorite.  For me, the 1984 version, no matter its faults and campiness, better captures the heart and soul of the story.  

Yes, this newer version seems like a remake of the older movie in so many ways. Rebecca Ferguson is a great actress--she was brilliant in the White Queen--but neither she nor Charlotte Rampling truly convey the sorcery of the Bene Gesserit as well as the older film. 

The other actors do their parts well, but no one really stands out or shines, perhaps because they take their roles so seriously.  Additionally the action sequences in the 1984 version were much better directed, and the overall story took a more dynamic process, keeping the viewer held spellbound in one's seat. Unfortunately, this new movie plods along a bit, and there is nothing too new or exciting.

I will definitely go to see Part Two, as I am a Dune fan, but I do not think any additional sequels should be made.  The story is very complex and convoluted, and it is too difficult to truly capture on film.

4.5,"I think this Dune edition is satisfactory (especially compared with a 1984-dated movie) for a Dune reader. The 1984 version moved so fast without describing the situation. It loaded so many scenes and fragments without making the audience digest those. The 2021-dated version doesn't only satisfy in a way with visuals and the method of telling and describing the story, unlike the old one.

The most exciting scene was witnessing Paul's awareness sessions. This is unique, and each book-to-movie case should take this example while using flashbacks and flashforwards. Also, the producer transferred the right amount of LoD (level of details) from the book by using some genius tricks such as choosing holo-projectors to illuminate the backstory and some details instead of adding more 1-1 dialogue. (Some of the information gathered by 1-1 talk in the book is summarized by holo-projectors.) 

The movie is also good at concealing particular moments from the book. In the book, the moment of forbidding excessive water usage was a critical point. Amid the movie, I wished to see this example, but showing this example in the context would be so didactic. It would be an example that diverges from the movie's approach.

But I am concerned about those who didn't read the Dune series.

4.0,"Adapting Frank Herbert's epic, mythology-filled novel to the big screen is a task which has gotten the better of many a filmmaker, but Denis Villeneuve has, thankfully, pulled it off. I'm a huge fan of Villeneuve's work, a man who takes time to allow stories to develop and characters to grow, and this film once again demonstrates his incredible ambition and dedication to his craft. The film clocks in at around 2 hours and 35 minutes, an unwieldy runtime by any standards. But Villeneuve uses the time well, mostly slow dripping the backstory and mythology so it doesn't become too confusing. It's still hard to keep up with at times, and I was reminded of watching the first episode of Game Of Thrones, where names of characters, districts, towns and other things are thrown at you full force, and you have to sit back and try and process it all. I understood most of what was going on, and which characters wanted what, though some of them got a little mixed up in my mind. The film looks enormous. Shots of cities, deserts and groups of people are made to look gigantic thanks to the camerawork and the sheer scope of everything. Hans Zimmer's score, while a little overenthusiastic at times, is also suitably epic. I liked the performances from the unbelievable cast, though with so much going on some of the big-name stars, such as the highly billed Javier Barden and Zendaya, get very little to do, but their role in the sequel is certainly established. The action scenes are beautifully shot and choreographed, and you always have a sense of where things are and where people are going, except for the final fight scene, which apes the worst of Marvel's hand to hand fights for some unfathomable reason. It's a giant undertaking, a giant story, and it's resulted in a naturally giant film. It works well on its own and sets up the next one perfectly.

Here are what I loved about it
1) The build up to Dune 2 and Dune Messiah 
It starts slow, however there is some action in the Dune movie but it was more focused on storytelling and building up the next two Dune movies. 
2) Cast played their characters to perfection!
Dave Batista (former WWE champion turned actor) although he had very little screen time, he played his character well and will probably be someone that is important later on in the next two movies. 
Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron from Star Wars and Apocalypse from Xmen) As the main characters father, he played his character very well. He is an amazing actor and had done an amazing job as the protagonists father. 
And last but not least, Timothee Chalamet. He did amazingly well as Paul in Dune and his acting in this movie is one of his best yet!
3) The visual effects, special effects, imagery, photography
Both were amazing! It made me feel like ¨WOW! HOLY COW! THIS IS AWESOME!"" It was like it was real! 
4) Conclusion
Towards the end of the movie, it sets up the big war between the protagonists and antagonists in the next two movies (My theory is that the final battle will be in Messiah) As it ends with a cliffhanger, it made fans yearn for more Dune.

Gli attori sono tutti di grande spessore e la storia è talmente piena di eventi da raccontare, che la scelta ricade sul dividerla in più capitoli, ovviamente anche per ragioni commerciali.

Villeneuve's hazy, sandy look and drably dressed players may be closer to the source material and his casting is certainly impressive but he fails to bring the story or characters to vivid life. His Blade Runner sequel was equally shallow in terms of artistic insight despite having a more provocative premise than the original. 

Also missing here are any standout performances. At least the Lynch film had some entertaining and unforgettable characterizations that didn't just go over-the-top, they left the top far, far below (Baron Harkonnen and Rabban were particularly scenery chewing and broadly performed but at least they were absurdly bad in a fun way).

Fair disclosure, I love Denis Villeneuve movies (my fave director). So I have trouble knowing how much of that predisposition causes me to say Dune Part One is a top-3 movie for 2021.  It's gorgeous, just lovingly constructed moment to moment.  It completely transports you to its universe.  I also appreciate how the moviemakers had to make Dune seem different from Star Wars, when George Lucas basically stole Star Wars from Dune.

But I have one fault for it.  By adhering so closely to a book from decades ago, Dune gives us yet another recycled White Man Savior movie.  If they didn't want to make Paul a Paula (and have Zendaya as the lead actor), at least they might have thought about making House of Atreides not be white people.

5.0,"I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.

I have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with ""gender correct"" ones for no real good reason.

There is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some ""critics"" at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes ""critics"". No surprise there.

The movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.

I also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.

Overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.

It is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.

I have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn't go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.

If I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.

One more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.

5.0,"Arguably the greatest cinematic experience since LOTR: Return of the King
With jaw dropping cinematography, spectacular performances and sound design that will shake you to your core, Dune is everything you want in modern cinema. 

Dune uses its long run time to  wade capably through its compelling and intricate source material, and presents a brilliant foundation for its conclusion coming in 2023. There are some details that are lost in the mix; the esoteric names of characters and titles in a foreign language can sometimes be missed, but would be cleared up easily with a subtitles. You can't quite make out exactly what they are saying but the phrase is repeated enough for you to understand what is being referred to. 

Denis Villeneuve has mastered the presentation of scale, and the sheer size of the world of Dune is a masterpiece in its own right. The monstrously huge ships, cities creatures and numbers in Dune are a sight to behold and so well articulated on the screen. 
What was most compelling was the sound, both in design and the score. Bone shaking chants, prayers, screams, and sound effects, underscored by the ineffable Hans Zimmer topped of this beacon of cinema.

3.5,"""Dune"" is a great book and it, along with its sequels, are compelling reading. However, they are NOT short nor light reading and to make a decent version of the first book, it's hard to imagine doing anything other than making a mini-series. This was one of several reasons why I hated the David Lynch version from 1984. It crammed so much stuff into such a short film that it often was confusing....and the director himself hated the film. Apparently, the studio took the movie away from him and hacked it to pieces...thus making it so confusing. Because of this, I was not interested in seeing this 2021 version....until I learned it was only part one and the second film would complete the first ""Dune"" book.

So, from the outset, this film can't help but be better than the 1984 version. BUT, it manages to do something I didn't expect...it's actually TOO long...or so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candy...along with very moody music. In many ways, it reminded me of the first ""Star Trek"" movie...which was so long and tedious...and had too many scenes where you just see a ship flying through space! And, in ""Dune: Part One"" there are too many scenes like this and not enough emotion and dialog. In other words, it seems to need a more personal and human tough to make it a truly great film. Now I am not saying it's bad or to avoid it. But the film could have been tightened up a bit and paced better.

Fortunately, if you have never read ""Dune"", this film is approachable and does follow the book closely.",Kristfer L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Jan 07, 2022",Kristfer L,/user/id/979433806,RT,979433806,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1607351146268272/picture

5.0,"Dune is a movie that requires total attention and patience. Despite being a blockbuster, if you try to watch this film unpretentiously with a group of friends, you'll probably find it boring. But if you're ready to watch it, to enter deeply into that universe, you'll be gifted with one of the most sensory experiences of the year. Timothée Chalamet made me lose all prejudices I had against him and finally convinced me as a great actor. His eyes are possibly the most expressive ones of the year, for me, he deserves an Oscar nomination. Rebecca Ferguson is imposing, despite discreet, and Oscar Isaac's character remembered me of Mufasa and Argyle Wallace. Zendaya is almost a mystic figure and I can't wait to see what she'll do in part 2 (which is already confirmed). The botanic girl and the Chinese doctor have good little arcs and Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa have interesting contrast. Some people can say the movie quite doesn't have a story.

4.5,"It happens occasionally where a film will be so completely unlike anything you've ever seen before. For myself, I can think of three. The first is Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. Regardless of what others have to say about the story being too complicated or hard to understand, I went into the theatre without any prior expectations or requirements that the film needed to meet. And it still blew me away, and remains one of my favorites. The second is Denis Villeneuve's 2016 alien invasion film Arrival. I will never forget watching it in the theatre. It transformed me in a way no other film has. The third is Dune: Part I, also directed by Denis Villeneuve. Entering the theatre, with my love of Arrival preparing me for another Villeneuve masterpiece, I was simply giddy. Then the Sardaukar throat chant of ""Dreams are messages from the deep,"" blasted over the speakers. I froze. I was silent. The alien sound of the quote sent me straight into the story. Completely and totally invested, only about six seconds in. Villeneuve nails the feeling of being on another planet, in another time, and everything does feel incredibly foreign and different. The unnatural pale skin of the Harkonnens, the glowing blue eyes of the Fremen, and the hooded veils of the Bene Gesserit. Caladan does have some strong similarities to Earth, but it is most likely to help the audience understand and empathize with the Caladonian characters, particularly Paul and his family, far better. That being said, the spaceships and technology are unlike anything in any film….ever. That is in large part due to the fantastic special effects this movie has to offer. The Sand Worms especially appear absolutely terrifying and awe-inspiring. Villeneuve's cinematographer was Greig Fraser, and he truly designs and executes some of the most beautiful shots in film history. The performances of the actors in the film are as convincing and believable as the setting around them. Timothee Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides, delivers another spectacular performance. His delivery and portrayal of the character gives Paul so much depth and relatability. His mother, Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson, is also an intensely emotional character, who's arc reveals her as a brave, fiercely loyal, and deeply compassionate leader. Stellen Skarsgard plays the evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a hideous and violent imperialist who seeks to dominate the titular planet. Skarsgard's performance, for me, is the best in the film. Despite only being present for around fifteen minutes in total, the Baron is a terrifying and hideous enemy, who immediately fills the audience with fear. This wouldn't be a fair review without mentioning Hans Zimmer's simply perfect score. The soundtrack is without a doubt sensational in every way imaginable. The music conveys complicated and deep emotions, sets the scene with intensity and vibrance, and reveals hidden intentions and secrets. It's powerful, moving, and truly out of this world. With it's fantastic performances, soundtrack, and direction, Dune truly shows itself to be a remarkable achievement for everyone involved in its production.

I could have done something passable but this hit the target.....Dune: Part One follows Timothée Chalamet's Paul Atreides as he's forced to embrace his destiny as the leader of his family and an entire race of people. Filmmaker Villeneuve, working from a script written with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, delivers a fairly faithful adaptation that is, for the most part, visually impressive yet dramatically inert, as the movie, much like its source material, suffers from an arms-length feel that's exacerbated (and perpetuated) by an emphasis on dull, one-dimensional characters and dialogue-heavy sequences transpiring predominantly within dimly-lit environs – with the far-from-enthralling atmosphere preventing the viewer from working up much interest in or enthusiasm for the protagonists' deliberately-paced exploits. It's clear, consequently, that Villeneuve's larger-than-life approach doesn't fare nearly as well as one might've hoped (or anticipated), as the picture's myriad of meticulously-crafted set-pieces are unable, generally speaking, to pack the exciting, visceral punch for which the filmmaker is obviously striving (ie the movie is, ultimately, big on spectacle but frustratingly short on everything else).

4.0,"""Desert power!""

Long ago…in a galaxy far far away…before ‘Star Wars', ‘Mad Max', ‘Tremors', and ‘Game of Thrones'.... there was only ‘Dune'.

A story and world that gave birth to fantasy and Sci-Fi as we know it, as a main influence and many more for years to come. Although, I haven't seen the other adaptions of ‘Dune' with either of the Lynch or TV version. So, this is my first introduction to the world and characters, and something that was once considered unadaptable has become a reality all thanks to Denis Villeneuve vision. And now I'm interested in this world and the movie leaves you wanting more.

'Dune (2021)' - man what a trip. Incredible in every sense. Just like ‘Blade Runner 2049', nobody does art house blockbusters better than Denis Villeneuve. A Sci-Fi tale of philosophical richness that's loaded with grand spectacle. While I didn't see it in IMAX, but that didn't take away from the scope of it all.

No joke, but this could be our new Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.

The acting here is strong:

Timothée Chalamet has impressed me ever since his breakout role in ‘Call Me by Your Name', so it's not surprising that he did an excellent job in this movie as the character of Paul, the young man in royalty whose destiny can lead him in either direction. Not bad for a kid who started off showing off his X-Box controllers on YouTube. If you don't know what I'm talking about, type into YouTube ""ModdedController360"" and you'll see.

Oscar Isaac plays The Duke, the father of Paul, and Oscar Isaac has yet to deliver a terrible performance. There's one scene between him and Chalamet that was one of the most moving things I've seen in a Sci-Fi movie since...well, 'Arrival' and 'Blade Runner 2049'.

Rebecca Ferguson plays Lady Jessica Atreides, who is easily the heart of the movie, and it might be my favourite performance from her.

Jason Momoa plays Duncan, the ultimate Chad, who's a chill guy but is an absolute demon when it comes to fighting. Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, a cool but serious man who loyal to those close to him. Stellan Skarsgård scenes as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the bloated and slimy creature with a hunger for power and chaos, which also pays a wonderful homage to Marlon Brando's Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in ‘Apocalypse Now', through the visuals in every scene he's in. Also, despite the small screen time he had, but Dave Bautista has proved that he has more range as an actor than most wrestlers who turned to acting.

Zendaya isn't in the movie that much, but I know she will be in the next movie. Her little scenes were very mystical. She appears mostly in visions from Chalamet's Paul, which people have best described those ""visions"" as the most expensive perfume advert ever.

In terms of the visual effects and the practical work, it's a piece of art. It helps create a sense of scope that made everything feel so big, so real and so engaging to watch. I can say all of it looked pitch perfect. But also using real locations for open spaces and made certain bits of environment like heat from the actual desert, harsh winds, soggy rainy, grass, and the breath-taking landscapes seem familiar to us in this ""alien world"".

The score, make-up, costumes, production design, cinematography, editing, sound, and direction were all top notches.

However, the movie does feel like a part 1 and for some people the movie feels incomplete, story wise. But then again, if it leaves you wanting more and we now know we are getting a part 2 to this story, this issue will expire when the second one comes around.",Matthew L,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 31, 2021",Matthew L,/user/id/37fc7356-2699-46b5-bbc6-05e745617baf,RT,37fc7356-2699-46b5-bbc6-05e745617baf,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000196775387/picture

5.0,"Well, this one need some words. I never read the books, rearely do. I did saw Lunch's film. I remember some visuals, but otherwise it left me pretty much clueless and it's considered my worst film of his by miles. Jodorowsky tried to do this film way back. It got into years in production and was about to become a 10 hour plus film with rockstars and the wildest effects and props the world had seen. I saw the 2013 docu about that film and it's know to be the best film never made.
Now, it's done. It's made, and it delivered. Boy did it deliver.

The story is huge - the most sold sci-fi book of all times if I remember correctly. That will take some time to put on screen. Plenty of characters, races, worlds, languages, ways and rituals. Villeneuve presents it perfectly. It's slow, but not too slow. You get a grip of it, while you slowly enter this amazing world. There is no need to go deeply into the plot here, but let's just say that there are a few rulers of worlds - some good, others bad, searching for collaborations or war in the year of 11000 something.

It becomes a drama, a hunt and a matter of life and death for both races and individuals. Throw in the most simplistic, enormous creatures mixed with gigantic spaceships that can destroy earths in seconds and you are in for a sci-fi action drama that wil blow your socks off. Villeneuve was made for this film. He earned his right to do the biggest film in newer times as he has such strong films under his belt - I have seen them all except from ""Polytechnique"" and he always deliver. I was wrong, I did not want a follow up or two, but it will surely be needed. I will almost count days for it's release.

The cast is amazing and so is the eeri-esque music. The visuals is still the strongest factor here, along with the narration when all things are combined. This long film is nearly flawless and screams for the big screen.

I like to look at this film as the artistic and darker version of the Star Wars universe. I know it will be dragged out into more films and even series. I don't like the series idea, but yes - I'm dying for the next film.

2.0,"Dune itself could be an incredible saga, though was ultimately let down by Denis Villeneuve's lack of ability to tell a story without boring us to death with a showreel of visual composition.

Don't get me wrong, at least, Villeneuve is great at that, but he should not be allowed to direct a movie until he has learnt how to tell a story, which are two very different things.

Brooding atmosphere was his attempt, which overall failed as the director tried to sustain more of a long and cheap meditation video attempt. Though it worked, as I fell asleep well that night.

Leider lässt Warner Bros. keine einzige Imax-Szene im Film für uns Konsumenten (Getestet die 4K UHD - Standard Ausgabe). Sehr sehr schade. Dies führt zu Abzügen.

4.0,"Dune has had a few adaptations for both the big and small screen, but never at the scale and scope of Denis Villeneuve's. It's vast, even in the early part of the story it's telling, and that open-endedness could play as both exciting for those aware of the lore's trajectory and flat for those who aren't.

This first part, or really first act, sets the stage for things to come while peppering in just enough excitement, intrigue, and reveals to keep pacing up. It certainly didn't feel like the two and a half hour runtime. 

On a more granular level, cinematography has a wonderful, desaturated and earthy feel. Cold for the most part, really only dipping into intense warmth with Paul's visions. It shouldn't be to surprising, really, as that work was done by Greig Fraser - the replicated look of organic lighting and neutral tones flow right out of Rogue One and The Mandalorian, while the bits of heavy saturation we do see can be recognized in the trailers for his upcoming The Batman.

While it's shot beautifully, and the large scale moments hit hard, I do wish the intimate action had a little more oomph behind it. Wide shots linger on fast-paced close combat in a way that removes some of the impact. Portions of the film use extremely close-ups to great effect so it's strange that fights aren't given the same care.

My worry for Dune is that a fair amount of folks will come out thinking it's only a portion of the story, which it of course is. I'm speaking more about folks who don't know how grand the story is or that the similarities to Star Wars are there because it inspired a lot of the biggest themes in Star Wars. The people who know how a film, even if it's part of a franchise, is typically structured. Especially in the latter's case, it could feel unresolved and anticlimactic. Not knowing it's ""Part One"" until the title card reveals itself, when TV spots and posters could have been more forthcoming, feels like a misstep.

Dune: Part One is a tone setter and world builder. Plenty of events happen, but this movie is more about nodding towards what's to come than giving a full arc. Luckily I am part of the crowd that knows what's to come, so for me it worked tremendously well - but mostly all I can think about is if it left folks that are none-the-wiser wondering why this first entry felt incomplete.",Mikey O,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 23, 2021",Mikey O,/user/id/979407386,RT,979407386,
4.5,"Es una de las cosas más espectaculares que he visto visualmente.
Después de que Lynch tratara de adaptar esta obra de Frank Herbert al cine y fracasar, llega una nueva adaptación, ahora de la mano de Denis Villeneuve. Esta primera parte de dos es realmente fascinante en todos los aspectos, es una experiencia única que he vivido en el cine por la perfecta cinematografía que es lo que Dune merece ya que varias de las escenas que explica el libro se visualizan de esta manera y esta nueva adaptación de 2021 logra que el espectador se pierda de lo maravillosa que es. ¿Habrá algo mejor que la cinematografía, dirección y efectos especiales de Dune? La respuesta es sí, y es tanto el sonido como la banda sonora que es lo mejor de toda la película y posiblemente lo mejor del año. La música de Dune está cuando debe estar y Hans Zimmer hace el que es para mí su mejor trabajo incluso superando a la banda sonora deInterstellar (2014) , Zimmer hace realmente un trabajo increíble y que quedará para siempre. 
Si hablamos tanto de mezcla como edición de sonido es otra cosa que se debe mencionar como algo espectacular, en cada escena el sonido está impresionante, jamás hay un fallo y enloquece por lo mismo, junto con la banda sonora son dos cosas que te vuelan la cabeza.

Decir que la dirección de Denis Villeneuve en esta película es la mejor de su filmografía es algo completamente subjetivo porque siempre nos tiene acostumbrados a trabajos de este calibre; pero sin duda alguna Dune compite entre sus mejores trabajos como director y es por la manera en que Denis se esforzó y le puso tanto cariño a su propia adaptación de Dune ya que él mencionó que le apasionaba mucho adaptar esta novela a su manera y que quería hacer el mejor trabajo posible, y eso se nota bastante.
Otra cosa que se destaca por supuesto que son las actuaciones, todos en el filme un maravilloso trabajo pero si tengo que quedarme con dos interpretaciones sin duda alguna me quedo con Rebeca Ferguson y Jason Momoa, este último realmente me sorprendió debido a que nunca lo había visto en una película tan seria como Dune y lo hace de una manera brillante. No está de más elogiar las actuaciones de Timothée Chalamet y Oscar Isaac que de igual forma hacen un muy buen trabajo. 
Mi única queja de la película sería que los últimos 30 minutos baja el ritmo bastante y se vuelve lenta. Las primeras dos horas la película iba con un ritmo rápido y excelente y sabía que en cualquier momento ese ritmo se caería y fue en los últimos tramos de esta.

Movie mixes Shakespearean ""tragic great families"" fable with Villeneuve's penchant for dramatic, bold contrasts, beautiful (and uniquely rendered) cinematography and good old fashioned action and adventure plot tropes - there are awesome and strange things in this movie and many exotic and bizarre design elements.

5.0,"Having read the books before going in to watch Dune at IMAX I was worried about whether the movie would be able to capture and portray the immense, epic story. As arguably one of the greatest Sci-Fi stories ever told, director Denis Villeneuve has absolutely NAILED it and paid utmost respect to not only the original author Frank Herbert, but more importantly, to the readers. 

The movie is sensational and applies an incredibly honest and faithful adaptation of the story in the book, testament to DV's dedication and quest for perfection. It had me smiling uncontrollably and nodding along as each of my imagined scenes and mental images I'd created while reading the books were brought out onto a screen so perfectly. 

Cinematography is a feast for the eyes, with every shot capable of being frozen, printed and mounted on a wall as art. 
Sound design, again incredible. Hans Zimmer's score and the sound effects used during action sequences are an audiophile's wet dream. 

I've come accross a few reviews that said the movie felt ""unfinished"". You can tell these people haven't read the book(s), which is ok, but not if they haven't done any research into the story at least. This film is clearly titled Dune: Part 1 in the opening sequence and represents only HALF of the story of book 1 out of 6. Does it build a little slowly? Sure, but so does the book, that's how you create a legendary masterpiece.  
Whilst unclear how far in the saga this film series will extend to, I believe they will tell the primary story of Paul Atreides only (books 1&2), most likely over another 1 or 2 films and I personally can't wait to see what Denis Villenueve can magic up next. 

I strongly urge you to go and see this movie at the theatres. Just go and watch it, sci-fi fan or not, this isn't just a story about space and laser guns. It's one of the most philosophically beautiful and politically intricate sagas ever told, with a splash of action, absolutely stunning visuals and a sound design that will blow you away, you wont regret it.",Elyas R,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 16, 2021",Elyas R,/user/id/978247547,RT,978247547,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220185147836868/picture

Well, I just watched ""Dune"" and I have slightly mixed feelings. On one hand, it's a bold concept as well as a visual and sonic epic. The scenery combined with Hans Zimmer's score really create the atmosphere I think that Denis Villeneuve was going for. It's also competently acted, with Rebecca Ferguson being the standout. On the other hand, it does very much feel like a set up for another film. While that's not entirely a bad thing, it does leave the film feeling incomplete and unable to stand on its own. It's also definitely a slow burner, which may leave impatient viewers a little frustrated. With this being said, it's definitely a viewing experience like no other this year and I'm interested to see what part two will hold.

Director/Editor choices very poor - omitted or much worse, changed key scenes. Horrible space travel ships. Horrible non-treatment of Navigators. Even the worms sucked, and the personal shields were a joke, compared to 1984. For 2.5 hours and covering only 1/2 of Book 1 it was an almost total waste of time and . Sorry I didn't watch it for free on HBOMax when it was 1st released. Won't go to Part 2. Very surprising how poorly they mis-used 2020-2021 technology and CGI.

3.5,"There's a lot of things that work in this film. The cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack is phenomonal. (obviously because Hans Zimmer duh) The main cast is strong and delivers a great performance overall. The action is also great with wonderful choreography.

However, as someone who is not familiar with the original novel, I found it extremely hard to follow the story and make sense of some scenes. The characters names were hard to remember and I didn't feel anything when a character we were meant to care about died.

The dialogue was also hard to hear a lot of the time and would definitely benefit from subtitles, as I think a lot of the political scenes with heavy dialogue were the most confusing part to follow.

My favourite scene was when Paul had to endure excruciating pain while a poisoned needle was held at his neck. I got literal chills from that moment.

That being said, my favourite part of this fictional world were the sandworms. The tension every time they were shown on-screen was exhilarating to say the least. The sound design of the spaceships was also top notch. This film definitely nailed the atmosphere for sure.

4.5,"Finally saw Dune in IMAX like Villeneuve intended.
Dune: Part I is the adaptation of the first half of the novel written by Frank Hebbert, ""Dune"".
I am going to be completely honest and say that I probably only got 75% of what happened in the movie, but dear god was it incredible?!

Denis Villeneuve strikes back! Dune is full of power and energy and even in the silent scenes it taunts us with its energy.

The world building here is remarkable and the landscapes, the cities, the futurist helicopters, the worms, all the engines and equipment, the shields, are all astounding. One of the best works in world creation that I've seen in movie. The visual effects are terrific and I'm still shocked by the fact that marvel's Black Widow had an higher budget than Dune.

The cinematography by Greig Fraser is phenomenal, brutal, epic and immersive. I haven't seen a movie that looked this good in the theathers for some time i gotta say.

Dune's action scenes were the cherry on top. Fantastic fight sequences filled with well cordinated moves that make you stick to your chair.

Thimotheé was fantastic, and might I say the second best role of his career just after Call me by your name. Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac performaces were very strong as Paul's parents. Jason Mamoa was surprisingly wholesome, i love that dude!

Han Zimmer did a great job, once again. Not a soundtrack that we can listen on a daily like Interstellar's, but one that functions incredibly well in every moment of suspence and every moment of madness.

Production Design, Art Direction, Editing, just everything really was top notch. I see Dune as a serious contender for almost every single Academy Award this year.

Dune is a movie that you are almost obligated to see on the big screen! It is filled with elements that are enhanced by a theater experience.

4.0,"I thought it was a great movie, with great visuals and nice for me quite faithful to the book. 

The one thing it missed I thought was the most interesting part of the book Dune, the whole concept of how an organization like the Bene Gesserit tries to maintain its force, or its goals, over eons of time. The idea that you might have to wait hundreds of years for conditions to be right to act, while during that time maintaining your capabilities and human resources at peak efficiency. And that you need to adopt strategies that take many hundreds of years to develop. The most interesting dilemma the book continually poses is when you have to be bold or innovative in taking action, even though by definition being bold means you are taking a risk of failure that could mean the end of everything you have tried to achieve. Of course it helps if you can foresee the future …

This all seems very relevant in our world today, for instance in our political arena where the forces for truth need to defeat the tendency towards self-serving and lies, or in planetary conservation that depends on creating a sustainable economy versus an extractive economy.

The most humbling aspect of this, that I think the book addressed, is to realize that the stakes are enormous, but the way is difficult. The only real-life successful example I can think of is what nature has invented to do to perpetuate the species and ecosystems. For the first, it had to invent something called the sex drive with its multiple components in each species that are designed to be reinforcing and unbelievably powerful. For the second nature has created an exquisitely integrated cyclical system that achieves 100% recycling and continually renewed productivity.

The books, written by Frank Herbert back in the ‘60s, are considered by many to be one, if not the, greatest sci-fi epics ever written. I haven't read the books, but this version of DUNE (there have been others) has ignited an interest for me to read the books some time.

DUNE is visually stunning with cinematography that is cosmic in its view that moves down to intimate portrayals of faces and people. The action sequences are intense contrasted with moments of quiet reflection.

It's a long movie but the pacing is so good it doesn't feel long and I felt totally engaged for the whole story. The actors are well cast and are believable as is the world that has been created for them to live in. Characters are skilfully developed. The soundtrack is superb.

5.0,"From the plot point of view, Wei Shen's narrative continues Blade Runner 2049 and Coming as always, not because of the slow pace told to the public, but because of the fast life, our aesthetic becomes more and more impatient, and the narrative rhythm of Dune is just right, in short, it is a ""Revenge of the Prince"". However, Wei Shen shows a grand world view through characterization and lens language, and makes extensive use of it. Not only through some details, such as the red of the sword cut to the shield, the audience can better understand why the cold weapon is used to fight in the distant future, but also the hero's shaping is very stereoscopic. At the beginning of confusion, the battle with Jamie completed the transformation, and freeman people accepted his plot changes, and the gods talked and talked. Not only that, but what shocked me most was the appearance of the first sand worm. When the sand worm slowly devours the spice truck from the sand dune, the male host and his party overlook the picture of the sand worm, which makes me personally immersed. Although many directors of the IP adaptation film of Dune novel have overturned, the combination of Wei Shen and Dune is undoubtedly the most suitable. Hans Zimmer's score also uses a lot of voices to express the vast and mysterious sand dune scene, especially when the sorority is coming, there is a feeling of miracle, cool colors used. This is undoubtedly the best interpretation for the future, the dune land where freeman people live. In this cold era of political turmoil, perhaps only human nature is the sharpest blade.

4.5,"Dune is a visually thrilling, immense, spectacular film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Director Denis Villeneuve is a master of making the spectacular personal and he has succeeded greatly here with equal focus on both action and character. Based on the Frank Herbert novel this is a film about conquest and honour in a universe far far away. The story is very complex but I was struck by how I was never too confused by worlds I knew nothing about. House Atreides controls the planet Caladan and they have been assigned by the emperor to rule the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is a desert planet that has the extremely valuable resource of spice, which is crucial to the running of the empire. But they are set up for a fall after they land. The film focuses on the honour of the Atreides family and also the myriad aspects of capitalism and colonialism. Yes even in different universes these are the factors that oil the machine. Men fighting for territory at the expense of the people that inhabit these worlds. There are many great features to this film but special mention should go to another robust score by Hans Zimmer and also monumental cinematography by Greig Fraser. A talented and diverse cast ads extra with Timothee Chalamet and Oscar Isaac standouts. This is a magnificent achievement in world building making for a wondrous film.

5.0,"Truly, one of the most awe-inspiring and magnificent films I've ever seen.
Masterful set design, costume design, ship design, weapon design, tight script, well paced (for its runtime), amazing performances, incredible makeup, brilliant CG, awesome cast, gorgeous score. Incredible attention to detail. Every line delivery was fantastic. The direction, editing, and overall production was perfect. One of the rare films that I genuinely could not complain about a single thing in; it felt perfect. There's nothing I would change.

Unfortunately, I don't think this movie will ever really get the full recognition and box office reception it deserves due to lockdowns, economic downturn, and the changing film-going landscape, but Dune deserves the world.
I've heard divisive takes from other filmgoers, who either thought it was the greatest movie they've ever seen, or hated it because they got bored and fell asleep in the first 30 minutes. I fall in the former category. I'll accept that those of a different mind might find the first half hour not gripping enough, those easily bored might not enjoy it, but definitely any nerdy fan of sci-fi, fantasy, mythology, or grand, epic stories, should come away from this film very happy.

3.0,"I was unimpressed with the inclusion of ""Gen Z"" type conversation.  I would argue that Gen Z viewers would not have been ""upset"" or ""felt disincluded"" had the writer not awkwardly forced this in.  

Changing Paul and Jessica from how they are in Dune, to being easily unsettled, fragile, vulnerable emotional characters that were arguably childlike was, again, to me a nod to Gen Z, to make the characters more relatable at the expense of the book version.  Changing the story to have Chani be more of a focus to me was purposeless, did not improve the movie.  Her contempt of Paul to me suggests this was, again, a shift to appease Gen Z more than anything.  Nothing against Gen Z, I just don't think the movie was improved at all by shifting it to pander, IMO.

Overall disappointed, not going to bother with Part II which I hear is being ""re-imagined"" to lessen Paul's role and greatly increase Chani's, and it's a shame to me.  I have been a huge Dune book fan for a long time now.  The movie could have been great.  Instead, it was just... good, suffering due to what I perceive as a weird forced pandering to a younger audience.

Intelligent story with faithfulness to novel, inspired casting, magnificent cinematography, generally (sometimes not) great CGI, terrific sound track.

That being removed (and replaced with a run of the mill Zendaya as Chani dream sequence on repeat), this version of Dune simply isn't weird enough, and in some ways exists as the antithesis to David Lynch's unfortunate 80's flop. Villanueve instead relies heavily on dull characters, dry delivery and dialogue, poorly developed intrigue, and the same lengthy action/escape sequences that bog down the novel.

4.0,"I am a long time fan of the Frank Herbert books. There is absolutely no way any film is going to include all the nuance of the original material but if you've read the book this movie does a good job of providing a canvas upon which you can superimpose your recollections. It is visually and aurally stunning. However, it's not perfect. Lady Jessica is somewhat more neurotic than I recall from the book. I'd have preferred a stronger more calculating representation. Not sure I liked the casting of Thufir Howat; the portrayal was a bit too much like Father Xmas for my liking, not the grizzled formidable character he should have been. As for Liet-Kynes, Duncan-Brewster's performance is good enough but I just don't follow the reasoning behind the gender swap. The father-daughter relationship between Kynes and Chani is clearly established in the book and all the casting did was to yank me out of the story because it jarred with my recollection of the book built up over decades of rereading.

4.5,"David Lynch famously brought his ""Dune"" vision to the screen in 1984. The film score for Dune was composed by the Rock group TOTO their first and only film score . Its sublime.

For those who haven't read the book - including myself - the 137-minute movie is a bizarre collection of characters, sets, endless references of spice, and constant internal dialogues that serve as narration. Frankly, the voice-overs are probably needed to help escort novice viewers.

As a side note, Princess Irulan's (Virginia Madsen) opening introduction is vastly helpful. I am pointing this out as If one is not familiar with lore of Dune ,Lynches film despite what critics and fans may have said about the effort ; I personally think it is excellent ""a film that gives LSD hallucinations without taking LSD."" It is a great starting point even though liberties were taken ; to learn the lore and charterers Herbert's novel.

Well, here we are on Earth in 2021, 56 years after Herbert's novel, 37 after Lynch's film, , Villeneuve's ""Dune"" arrived in theatres and HBO Max and soon to be Blu-ray , UHD If you want to see Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi masterpiece in the third dimension, it is getting a 3D USA Blu-ray release, yes you heard it here first , I have already Pre-Oreded my Dune 2021 3D copy it's going to be absolutely brilliant.

Dune contains a depth of worldbuilding that is seldom matched in science fiction. Dune also showcase powerful and influential religious figures in the all female Bene Gesserit witches . Classic myths, with the ledged in the Dune universe, Kwisatz Haderach is an old Chakobsa term that translates to ""shortening of the way. Ie. ""Folding Space and Time for Space travel. The Kwisatz Haderach must be male. The Bene Gesserit have been carving the way for the mythical figure for centuries through selective breeding-10,000 years of breeding to be precise.

Dune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) is a movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's original novel of the same name. It adapts about the first half of the novel.

The year is 10191.

A substance dubbed spice is the most coveted commodity in the universe because it's essential for interstellar travel. Spice - also named Spice Melange - is only found on one planet, Arrakis, a desolate, desert rock where scorching temperatures fall between unbearable and unlivable. If that wasn't rough enough, giant human-sucking worms - that are a couple of hundred yards long - could rumble from the sand and swallow you up in one bite.

The Freman (who live below the surface) live on Arrakis, and the dark orange spice - which looks like sand - seems to be everywhere.

A mythic and emotionally charged hero's journey, ""Dune"" tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive.

The movie is epic in scope, this 165-million-dollar celluloid creation offers a spectacular visual experience.

Dune is so masterfully shot, that you could watch this movie on mute and still be entertained.

The cinematography is Truley Oscar worthy .

As a longtime fan of David Lynch's film ""Dune"" it was inevitable, I would go into Denis Villeneuve's effort ready to find any fault. Lynch's DUNE is a sentimental cinematic treasure to me and I am not willing to give it up. I was pleasantly surprised ! I mean the source material is so fascinating with rich story telling and depth of character development it would be hard for it not to succeed and Dune 2021 does just that.

The casting is very well put together A-listers , Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgård. But the standouts are the two leads. Timothée Chalamet , as the lead character, Paul Atreides followed by Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, a concubine and member of the Bene Gesserit, a sect of women who, through mental conditioning, have the super-human ability to manipulate others and influence humanity for their own benefit. In many ways, it is Ferguson's movie. Ferguson is a pleasure to witness in the 2:36 minute run time she is absolutely stunning and brings emotional depth to her character with her acting. The film hinges on their mother-son relationship, and Ferguson balances her character's maternal anxieties and soldier like toughness with ease.

Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation. Denis Villeneuve's Dune looks and sounds amazing -- and once the (admittedly slow-building) story gets you hooked, you'll be on the edge of your seat for the sequel.

If Dune gets one thing right it's definitely the stunning visuals. Everything from the cinematography to the production design is brilliant and makes the story come alive. The cast is another praiseworthy aspect of the film especially Chalamet who was surprisingly very fitting for his lead role.

That weekend the three of us went and say it in IMAX about an hour away (and due fyi severe back pain I rarely get out, even in town,) but it was worth the few days off extra pain and despite rhaving seen it twice already on a 70"" plasma, seeing it in IMAX was amazing.

This was the shortest long movie I've ever seen, as it felt like it was at most 90 minutes long, despite being much longer.

I can't wait to go to see part 1 as the first part of a double feature, followed immediately by part 2. It'll be a long day at the theater, but it will definitely be worth it.

Barely hit a third of the storyline and way way too many long pauses staring at an unspeaking actor, with the expectation that you’ll figure out what they are thinking.

That said the cinematography was great, but the movie lacked the ability to tell the story and the fantastic nuances within…. It could have been epic, just a bit of internal monologue or God, anything…just anything to fill in the details…. I’m just sad.

1.0,"I found this movie to being a boring slog. Which was a massive disappointment because I really love the idea of Dune and I loved both Bladerunner and Arrival. At the start this film felt like it was going to be just my cup of tea, but as it went on I grew less and less interested in what the story has to offer. Perhaps if I was a fan of the books I'd have enjoyed this more, but I'm coming at this as someone who has only seen this film as their introduction to the Dune universe. A universe I have no real interest in ever visiting after watching this. 

I don't want to be too harsh on the movie as it was beautiful and everyone played their parts very well. However it did the biggest crime of any bit of entertainment--it left me feeling like I had wasted the only thing I can earn more of, my time. 

I don't need a movie to be full of action or comedy for me to enjoy it. I am a massive fan of, what I call, boringly entertaining movies. A long boring movie that has me thinking is so much better and memorable than most of what is offered up in modern times. That's the thing I need a movie that's going to be long and ""boring"" to make me think and this didn't. In the most brash why for me to put it it was just shit happening for nearly 3 hours. Nothing really deep to think about, no meat to chew on. 

Sure the argument could be made that this story is about colonization and capitalism, but that's honestly all there is to it. Not really that deep when the same ideas are expressed in a 60 second TikTok.

After failed attempts at bringing the Dune story to the big screen due to the sheer amount of content to cover, Denis Villeneuve manages to successfully tackle and present the story in the best possible way…. Well at least half of the story. As shown in the beginning of the film, this is only the first part of the book, so it could be easy to not be fully invested as you won't get a final conclusion to the story however the way Dune (2021) is told in its 150 minute runtime feels natural, explaining everything the viewer needs to know in a simple way, rather than the confusing narration of Dune (1984).

Finishing on an incomplete conclusion was expected from the start however it never distracted away from the story being told, Villeneuve has crafted a new world on screen which many will love. An easy comparison to make is Star Wars, however Dune (2021) is still nothing like, which shows how unique of a film it is.

As usual with a Villeneuve film, the cinematography is out-of-this-world, also hugely impacted by Hans Zimmer's score.

First of all I like Thimotée Chalamet as Paul, sorry Kyle, love you man but that part did not suit you. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica was bland and uninteresting but at least not a cyphre as in Lynch's version. Somehow she is apparently hard to bring to life from the books, not sure why.
Leto Atreides played by Oscar Isaac, well, who cares really, but I'd have to give it to Jürgen Prochnow, I mean unbeatable in terms of charisma even though he had so little to work with, still made the character memorable.
Ole Vlad Harkonnen  well done in both movies, I like evil to have a brain and both embodiments (a lot of body) showed that, but I'd have to give it to Stellan Skarsgard as in Lynch's movie Kenneth McMillan is brilliant but comes accross more as a raving lunatic, which deminishes the character, but still left a lasting impression as he did it so well, hmm, can't choose yet.
Of course no one can beat the great Brad Dourif as Piter, 'nough said. Beast Rabban is a toss up, don't know yet really. No doubt the second movie will also feature Feyd Rautha, but Sting was a bit ridiculous so not hard to improve on that.
Duncan is still a bit of a sketchily worked out character but Jason Momoa was ok in the part, what little there was, but the books themselves do not do much with the character, even though he features in different forms throughout most of the books and it is an important character, but Herbert never really fleshed him out proper, so it also shows in the adaptations.
Javier Bardem, well, I watch him in anything, but we haven't seen much as yet of Stilgar, but he'll do great no doubt.
Josh Brolin is a better fit for Gurney Halleck than Patrick Stewart as far as physique and personality go. Mr. Stewart obviously is an accomplished actor, but he was simply miscast for that part.
Sian Philips as the reverend mother Mohiam of course was not to be beaten by even a great actress like Charlotte Rampling, I mean she was that part and in my mind is forever locked into it.
I'm very sorry, but I cannot for the life of me remember the actress playing Chani in the first movie, which is not surprising as again she is a badly written character in the books, which again is weird seeing who she will become to Paul, but even reading the books I kept forgetting about her.
Visually the movie is amazingly looking, as Villeneuve keeps proving with any movie he has made sofar, the man knows how to impress in that area.
It was to me the only redeeming quality of his Blade Runner sequel, which I disliked  as an uninteresting story, especially considering the original, but that's another topic.
All in all I really liked the movie and definitely want to see the sequel. Even though it clocked at 2.5  hours it was not slow, I rather wanted it to just continue, so that's a good sign.
Good effort, but will it become legendary and seen as a cinema classic, I doubt it.
Damn, I wished Jodorowsky would have realized his version, it would probably have had very little to do with the books, but damn if it wouldn't have been an instant classic, ah well, like the Stones sagely stated ""You can't always get what you want"".

5.0,"Dune is the sci-fi epic I've always dreamed of. Massive in scope but detailed and grounded in nature an exciting adventure with flawless special effects and fantastic designs but one that takes advantage of the genre to tell a rich and thematic story (rather than just the set dressing to cool action). The worldbuilding is a marvel to witness and for 2 hours and 35 minutes I was transported to another world. I hate to make the obvious comparison but with so many of these new Star Wars movies, it has just becomes a slideshow of planets we learn what material the planet is made of (sand, snow, salt) then we are off to the next one. Dune crafts a similarly vast and complex world but most of the story takes place in the sandy dunes of Arrakis, so that we are able to soak in all the culture, politics and people. Some of my favorite scenes are with Paul and his father governing the planet and learning the ins-and-outs of the daily operations. There are so many details that make the world feel real: space portals that allow for intergalactic travel and technology designed to not waste a single drop of water from your body are presented like that's obviously the way things have to be.

Paul makes for a compelling protagonist an unassuming boy who has the weight of the universe thrust upon his shoulders. You can tell he is a studious and bright individual, always questioning the world around him and the traditions of his people. His relationship with his family and mentors in the House of Atreides is refreshingly warm and caring and it made me feel invested. The feeling that something is off about there mission is there nearly from the start and keeps the tension during the slower parts. As the story progresses, Paul's visions seem to get more intense, and it lends the film a dream-like quality while creating the mystery of whether these are visions of the future or something else. The intergalactic politics are detailed but not overbearingly so. I love the Game of Thrones-esque power struggle, all centered around the valuable commodity of spice. I am also intrigued by the mysterious emperor and witches who seem to have some sort of nefarious plot cooking in the background. There are themes about religion, colonialism and environmentalism infused that you can draw direct comparisons to issues going on today, which just makes this story that much richer.

The film is certainly slow to start but it's this patient storytelling that pays off by the end. Once the betrayals, high drama and action kick in, it's pulse pounding and exciting. The body shield technology gives the combat scenes an extra layer of strategy as hand-to-hand combat has to evolve. The big criticism I see is that this is an incomplete story that ends in a jarring manner. Maybe I was prepared for this after hearing this warning beforehand but I was satisfied with how this film leaves off. Paul goes through a complete character arc and has to make a key decision in the climax. His character at the end of the film is a far cry from the boy who has lived a sheltered life surrounded by supportive people and struggles to get out of bed. So yes, Dune is easily one of the best blockbusters and sci-fi films ever made (certainly unlike I have ever seen) and I haven't stopped thinking about its rich world since I left the theater.",AirSabe,True,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 28, 2021",AirSabe,,Fandango,c3f47262-6f6c-42d9-916d-72e2fb4a8e03,

4.5,"Denis Villenueve brings viewers a star-studded sci-fi blockbuster that brings Frank Herbert's 1965 novel to the big screen. Villenueve adds to his recent string of sci-fi epics, following on from the 2016 Amy Adams-starring ‘Arrival', and the Oscar-winning ‘Blade Runner 2049'. The acclaimed director works alongside ‘Doctor Strange' writer Jon Spaihts and ‘A Star Is Born' writer Eric Roth to bring the best-selling novel to the screen. 
 
Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides (played in the film by Oscar Isaac) and main protagonist of the film. Paul is a man born into an unspeakable destiny who must travel to a new planet to ensure the future of his family and his people. But with conflict over the planet's most precious resource, only those who are strong enough will survive. Chalamet stars alongside a packed cast that includes Rebecca Fergurson, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac and Javier Bardem. ‘Dune' features solid performances throughout its entire cast, but it's doubtful any will be receiving recognition considering they're up against knockout performances from the likes of Jamie Dornan, Benedict Cumberbatch, Will Smith and Caitríona Balfe.
 
Despite being an explosive, big-budget sci-fi epic ‘Dune' still manages to convey emotion through it's more intricate scenes. Renowned composer Hans Zimmer crafts an incredible score for the film, Zimmer creates a score that keeps in mind the book's Middle Eastern and Islamic influences. ‘Dune' features breath-taking cinematography courtesy of ‘Lion' cinematographer Greig Fraser. Fraser's cinematography brilliant captures the extensive, explosive action sequences and the close-up, emotional scenes brilliantly. Even though the scale of ‘Dune' led to the first book having to be adapted into two films, Villenueve manages to make this film not feel too overstuffed or confusing to viewers who aren't familiar with the original novel. Previous Villenueve collaborator, David Dastmalchian, makes an appearance in the film, adding to his already successful year that includes performances in James Gunn's ‘The Suicide Squad' and the animated Marvel Disney+ show ‘What If?'. 
 
Much like the original book, ‘Dune' delves into many themes including power, fate, and free will. As shown in various conversations through the film, but also through the fact that the Bene Gesserit (a social, religious and political force comprised of women with mysterious powers) has the ability to control those around them with something known as ‘The Voice' - an audio-neuro control mechanism that forces others to do things against their will. The film explores themes like family, and finding, and taking, your place in the world around you. 
 
Costume designer Bob Morgan provides ‘Dune' with intricately detailed costumes that keep in mind the film's cultural influences and show a mix between the film's medieval/sci-fi nature. This mix, and also the contrast between the futuristic outfits with the more old-fashioned ones, helps to emphasise and show that in this future, modern technology like phones and computers no longer exists. Denis Villenueve manages to convey the size and scale of ‘Dune' to viewers in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or full-on. Instead, the French director eases viewers into this new, futuristic world.
 
‘Dune' is an intense, dramatic sci-fi affair that features solid performances from its entire cast. The film doesn't inundate viewers with an encyclopaedia of knowledge to take in all at once, much like how David Lynch's 1984 adaptation required viewers to be given a handout explaining various aspects of the film before screenings. Denis Villenueve gives audiences an exciting and visually pleasing blockbuster whose visual aspects make the film a unique, yet enjoyable, viewing experience.",Molly M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 27, 2021",Molly M,/user/id/188ea8fb-1db1-4ef2-b2c0-9871cff77b1c,RT,188ea8fb-1db1-4ef2-b2c0-9871cff77b1c,

Though much of the movie was a set-up for the events that are yet to unfold, the intrigue was there for everything that was set, be it the nature of powers that the protagonist possess or the mystery behind the Antagonist which were introduced and some which are yet to be introduced. The glimpse of politics surrounding the Bene Gesserit was nicely done & the emperor hyped up without officially introducing him. The journey that paul went through in the movie was great but the future of his character teased by the event that unfolded at the end and him showcasing his ability was really hyped moment.

5.0,"Dune (Part 1) is the newest adaptation of the 1965 Sci-fi novel from Frank Herbert in attempt to redeem itself from the 1984 adaptation. Dune dives in with a stellar cast consisting of Timothee Chalamet (who was a perfect cast of Paul Atredies), Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and more. The cast and their performances were spot on with the book and truly give more to their character than what's on the surface. The script does a wonderful job of pertaining true to it's book and the moments it skips over are unrecognizable by audience members who haven't read the book. The director and cinematographer do a stellar job on immersing you in the world the Dune dwells in. Hans Zimmer, as always, does a phenomenal job with the film's score. The final scene has a moment of vocals mixed with strong instrumentals that makes you want to bow down to Hans' work and the world you just spend 2 and a half hours in. I saw this movie three times in the theater as I am a fan of the book, and now the 2021 adaptation. I am thoroughly excited for Part 2, which releases in 2023.

5.0,"I've viewed Dune twice now, the second occasion in IMAX. It was an amazing experience.
I got the perfect seat as well. Row H, seat 15 – right dead centre of the theatre. I was at perfect eye level to catch every mesmerising shot as Hans Zimmer's booming score reverberated around the theatre and vibrated through the floor.
I had been eagerly waiting this movie for some time. I read Frank Herbert's novel roughly twelve years ago and enjoyed it and I hoped one day the right person would come to make a big screen adaptation – when I heard that finally a big budget adaptation would be made, I was excited. That was amplified further when news broke that the man at the helm would be Denis Villeneuve who's work includes Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. He also said that adapting Dune was his dream project. Then there was the stellar cast pulled together, the aforementioned Zimmer placed in charge of the music score and the year long postponement following the Covid 19 shut down. Anticipation in the weeks running up were getting bigger and bigger.
But the cynic in me feared that it might disappoint. As much as I have enjoyed Denis Villeneuve's films, they have had a reputation of being slow. There was also the news earlier in the year were Warner Brothers announced it would release all new movie releases to it's U.S. streaming platform, HBO MAX, the same day as cinema releases. Also, Part Two of the adaptation was not in commission in the run up to the films release which maybe was a sign the studio execs perhaps did not have the faith in it to be a smash hit or did not believe it would make the financial returns to justify a follow up – Don't immediately release to platforms then? More on that later.
To my delight, it was everything I hoped for. An epic Sci Fi film experience that transports the viewer to another world. It's not just that it's a visual treat, it even feels real. The costumes look authentic, they don't look silly which is so hard to pull off in a Sci Fi film. The spacecrafts looks real, from the way they move and sound and the locations, whether it's the vast sand barren of Arrakis or the dark and wet Giedi Prime, home world of House Harkkonen, look so authentic. The best compliment I could give it is that I was in a close-to-packed IMAX theatre and absolutely everyone was fully transfixed on what they were watching and it did not feel like 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time was stolen.
It's a next level work of art as well with generations of film-making rolled in to one film. You can see the evolution of Sci Fi cinema in the movie, you can see the influence of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner and David Lynch's 1984 attempt of the same work. More than that, it felt like I was watching a grand, era defining film that will inspire generations or at least I hope it does. It's up there with the best cinema experiences I've ever had. Up there with seeing Jurassic Park when I was 7, Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring when I was 13, The Dark Knight when I was 20, Inception when I was 22…but then that's when I began to feel sad.
There's a melancholic feel to experiencing Dune as well. If you're a keen enough film buff, you'll know that cinema is becoming less of a magical place in recent years. I don't mean the overall quality of films being released has become poorer (I actually believe there's more good films being released than ever but that's for another piece) it's more that less movies now are being released specifically designed for the cinema experience.
I wrote earlier about Warner Bros. deciding to release the movie on HBO MAX the same day as the cinema release in the U.S. They explained their decision to do that was because of uncertainty of the cinema's being opened due to the on-going Covid-19 pandemic. That's understandable but it's just becoming more normal for movies to jump straight into release to a streaming platform. A lot of people now are just happy to stay at home and watch films or binge-watch box sets on the many streaming services and sites that are easily accessible via the internet. By gosh have we done lots of it in the past 18 months. So instead of throwing millions at marketing and advertising a new film under it's banner, a film studio will now just release a new movie onto a streaming platform. It makes financial sense.
Even Marvel, the Box Office juggernaut of the past decade, is pushing more of it's releases to Disney+ sooner than expected. Black Widow was given a premium pass release to coincide with it's cinema release and Shang-Chi: Legend of the Ten Rings is being released to the platform by the end of November and I predict that if Eternals doesn't perform as strongly as hoped, it will be released to Disney+ in time for Christmas. Then if you look the pre-arranged releases for Marvel Phase 4, you'll notice there's largely more TV based projects than there are film projects, a sign that even they are slowly tapping out from the cinema market.
This isn't a complaint of streaming platforms. I don't know what I‘d do without Netflix, Disney+, NOW TV etc. If anything I should be praising them for helping me save money from forking dozens of pounds week after week on cinema releases. But Dune is proof that there is still appetite amongst movie lovers for that exhilarating, big cinema experience. Denis Villeneuve himself encouraged people to buy a ticket and experience his movie in the cinema because that's exactly why he made it, he wants people to enjoy his movie in a theatre, not at home on a laptop or phone screen. But that's just the way it's going and it really makes me feel sorry for the young cinema goers of today. I do not know if they'll get their awe-inspiring moments like I got with Jurassic Park, LOTR or Dark Knight because you don't get those feelings or reactions on small devices. That's why I really, really hope that there were some young film goers in that audience with me who felt those spine-tingling, booming moments.
There's something about Dune that made me feel like I was experiencing an ending…the end of big cinema. Well, at least until Part 2 is released.

There were many moments throughout the film that were absolutely breathtakingly beautiful and everything from the sand worms to the ornithopters looked very real. Not once could I tell if cgi was being used which is very rare nowadays on movies this size and it really helps that they filmed mostly everything on location. The sound design was possibly the best I have ever heard in a film and the score by Hans Zimmer was perfect. Every single actor did a fantastic job bringing their character to life, but the number one issue I can see with an average movie watcher going into Dune is it's slower pace and runtime.

4.0,"When you think of great modern day directors, who comes to mind? Christopher Nolan, Tarantino, Del Toro, David Fincher, Spielberg, the Cohen Brothers etc. Dennis Villeneuve is among the best of them all. His newest film Dune, based off of the novel written by  Frank Herbert. Is another film that he can add to his outstanding resume. I really liked Dune, as always Villeneuve delivers a visually stunning film, with outstanding sound design, and fantastic acting. As much as I liked Dune, it isn't one of my favorite films Villeneuve has done. It isn't on the level of Blade Runner 2049 or Sicario, but you know you're a good director when one of your more average films (by his standards) is still in the talks of being one the best films of the year. And that is exactly what Dune is. It isn't perfect, I have a few small issues, but the pros severely outweigh the cons, here is what I liked:

- Visual Effects 
- Cinematography
- Sound Mixing
- Sound Design
- Acting
- Excellent Storytelling
- Accuracy to the source material

As always, like all Villeneuve films. Dune is visually STUNNING, truly one of the nicest visual movies I've ever seen. It is so interesting looking, and the colors are at times dull, and at other times extremely bright. The cinematography is also quite impressive, (like always) it wouldn't surprise me if Dune won an oscar for visual effects or cinematography, it is really that impressive. The sound design is also likely to be nominated, it is incredibly loud and wonderfully done, and it sounds very different from other films. It is so loud to the point where I felt my seat vibrating. The storytelling is superb, complex, but it all comes together very nicely by the end. The cast works flawlessly together, Rebecca Ferguson is definitely the standout of the film for me, she is excellent as Lady Jessica, Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho is badass, and Oscar Isaac is great as Duke Leto. I haven't read the book, but according to several people I know, Dune is nearly perfect in terms of accuracy to the source material. The music is also incredible, it is of course extremely loud, and elevates suspense in already loud and intense scenes. Dune has a large list of Pros, but it is not perfect:

- Pacing In First Act
- Length of certain scenes

The first 45 minutes are REALLY slow, and while to my knowledge that is accurate to the book, it doesn't translate all that great on screen. And there are some scenes that drag a bit and feel like they could've been trimmed down a bit. 
Dune was very well done, from the booming sound, the visual scope, the acting and the quality storytelling. It was a bit long and the pacing in the first act is slow as can be, but the movie as a whole is still really good and the small problems I have with it do not affect my liking of the movie very much. I will check this one out again soon.

4.5,"The film ""Dune"" was directed by Denis Villeneuve. He made this film based on a series of books by Frank Herbert.

Previously, the original ""Dune"" was released in 1984, however, Denis Villeneuve is going to revive the film in a modern way. The cast is Timothee Shalamet as Paul Atreides, Rebecca Fergusson as Lady Jessica Atreides, Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, and many others, including rising star Zendaya as Chani. At the moment, ""Dune"" (2021) doesn't have any awards, but Warner Brothers studious is already nominated this film for 14 Academy Awards.

The action of the film is set in 10191. Padishah-Imperator Shaddam IV is giving into possession sand planet Arrakis to Leto I of the house of Atreides, this planet is the only source of melange or ""spice"" - a priceless substance, that increase human life and provides traveling through the stars. Duke Leto accepted dominion of the planet, from there a long and interesting journey begins, which doesn't intend to end so quickly. Paul Atreides, Leto Atreides' son is preparing hard to become a full-fledged Duke, but the main challenge is yet to come.

All aspects of this film are gorgeous. The story, acting, soundtrack, and sound design. I would also like to draw attention to the operator's work, the style of the shot makes it immersive in the film and become part of the story. The timing of the film is 155 minutes, however despite this - the film is watched in one breath.

I strongly recommend watching to everyone, who likes and appreciates the science-fiction films, the creativity of Denis Villeneuve, and cycles of books ""The Chronicles of Dune"" by Frank Herbert's fans.",Magnus B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 23, 2021",Magnus B,/user/id/979351472,RT,979351472,
4.0,It's a great movie with a lot of great CG and really good action sequences.

2.5,"I had a very hard time paying attention to this movie even though we went to see it in IMAX and it has me worried about my distant plans to watch all the Star Trek movies. I found the subject matter to be borderline-impenetrable, which is at least half my own fault. We chose this movie on very short notice; I didn't have a real desire or intention to dedicate my brain to learning all the jargon and character names and everything involved in what I knew to be an expansive media franchise. I re-watched the Harry Potter movies recently and read reviews from contemporary critics saying only fans of the book would love the first movie. I remember being filled with scorn & glee over that, like what kind of absolute rube is not already a fan of the book? But now here I am, in the same spot as those hapless fellows. I didn't have any specific problem with the way Villeneuve presented the material to us, it's just that my viewing strategy was to sort of sift through the specifics and keep the plot boiled down in my mind to its bare elements, but they advanced through developments so steadily that my recollection of what happened before the two characters escaped a flying ship is hazy at best. Things perked up a lot after that as there were only a few characters to think about and the plot became more similar to other works I'd seen, but it was far too late for me at that point.

3.5,"Closer to Herbert's novel than the 80s version, but I felt it was a little dull at points, and lacking the humour and pathos of David Lynch's version, which had the benefit of some incredibly gifted character actors (an oddly miscast Sting being one notable exception!)

In many ways, the changes to Herbert's novel make even less sense in this version than those in the last (where time constraints were a major factor), but I guess every director feels the need to 'stamp their mark' on their movies, and the changes are generally a lot more subtle. The reasons for these alterations and certain stylistic choices may be interesting, I felt there was more than a little homage to the Star Wars movies going on in some scenes, and clearly the director felt some of the themes and characters in the 1965 novel were a bit 'dated' for audiences in 2021.

An issue for some, which I read about before watching the movie, was the casting of Sharon Duncan-Brewster (a black, British actress) as Liet Kynes, whom the book very specifically describes as a white man with sandy coloured hair. Going in with an open mind on the subject, I didn't really understand what was added by casting Duncan-Brewster in the role, as it isn't as if the novel has a shortage of strong female roles in the first place, and there are plenty whose 'race' is never disclosed. On the other hand, I felt Duncan-Brewster played the role well, and it's only a small part in the book, so in some ways it's not a major issue. I wasn't entirely convinced the girl cast as Chani Kynes, could, plausibly be Duncan-Brewster's daughter, less a case of 'race' as just the massive differences in facial features, build etc...

Race and culture are significant issues in the book, in fact they're a large part of what the book is about, so in that regard some of the casting seems a little odd - unless you're looking at it through the prism of 2020 'colour blindness' perhaps? The Fremen were inspired by real desert dwelling cultures - I'm pretty sure the Tuareg, rather than the Bedouin, but in either case, it would have made more sense to me to cast people of one of those ethnic groups in the roles. It also makes little sense how small tribes of Fremen, isolated for hundreds of generations can still have both distinctly black and white tribal members? This does have a bearing on the casting of Duncan-Brewster, with Liet Kynes being the child of an 'Imperial Scientist' and a Freman woman in the book, and 'his' daughter, Chani, being the child of the 'mixed race' Liet Kynes and another Freman woman. 

A couple of other things come to mind. Vladimir Harkonnen is played with understated sinister malice, rather than as the somewhat 'pantomime arch villain' of Lynch's version, and even Herbert's novel. I actually thought the understated version in the current movie fitted the highly intelligent and Machiavellian nature of that character better. His 'perverted nature', largely characterised by a highly predatory, (and paedophilic?) homosexuality in Herbert's novel, is also non-apparent, perhaps a sign of the times?

I wasn't sure what was going on with the Sardaukar in the movie, the scene where they're first encountered is a distinctly jarring note in the movie, and has no relevance to the book. My septuagenarian father (who watched the movie with me) felt they were very 'Imperial Stormtrooper', whilst I thought there was strong homage in their appearance and dress to Lynch's 80s Dune movie. That wasn't the only apparent hark back to the 80s film for me, the Baron's white plastic-clad servants being another obvious one. I felt the odd sensation, as with the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, of watching a movie in which large chunks were not so much inspired by the original book(s) as by previous material from other sources, which were not true to the original, but 'popularly' accepted as such (if that makes any sense).

My final 'issue' with this movie (which incidentally, I did enjoy) was the lack of realism in the fight scenes (an issue which plagues most Movies). The fights described in the novel by Frank Herbert seem gritty, brutal and real, knife fights are quick, bloody and deadly, there are no 'big explosions' (okay, there are, but very, very few), and it's a distinctly 'low tech' environment. The fight scenes in this movie are generally quite ridiculous and show a distinct lack of understanding of real violence, or pre-modern warfare - like I said, hardly unique to this particular movie. The duel scenes, e.g. Paul vs Jamis, seem better done overall than the mass battle scenes, which whilst mostly on a truly 'massive' scale, and clearly aiming to impress visually, often make no logical sense at all. There is one truly weird scene with synchronised Atreides guards fighting in unison on some stairs which looked just like one of Peter Jackson's whacko battle scenes - if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm referring to.",Marco S,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Nov 21, 2021",Marco S,/user/id/977653076,RT,977653076,

The drama of the movie is hamstrung by the lack of any detectable musical score. I'm sure it exists, but while I was watching I didn't notice it. Maybe that's the new normal for films where they are scored to sound like TV shows, but it drains all of the impact of the story and leaves the film feeling like a boring documentary.

And then you have the overbearing soundtrack... shallow character development ... the only remember-able character was Harkonen, the rest was just meh.

Cinematography was okay and the worm(s) looked cool ... but the rest was just boring.
Even Dune's force powers were just moronic ... yes I get that if you're a fan of the books it might have made more sense... but as I haven't suffered from that affliction , some scrawny kid putting his hand in a box while some old hag holds a magic marker against his throat meant nothing ... and that is the movie in a nutshell weird unexplained things happening that don't get resolved nor do they matter.

If you want cool 70's based scifi, just watch the original Starwars again ...better story on the account it has one  ... if you want great cinematography in the dessert then just watch David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.

4.0,"For one, Dune, I believe, takes a special kind of person to love, but will be liked by everyone. For Sci-Fi fans already intimately familiar with picking up tidbits of lore and worldbuilding, Dune (2021) will be a film that keeps you constantly fascinated and intrigued by the amount of politics, tech, and mythology that's sprinkled throughout the film. Whether it be the houses, the dragonfly aircraft, or the treatment of the sandworms, fans of intensely captivating backgrounds have a lot to enjoy.

For those unfamiliar with Herbert's work, the beginning admittedly starts off very slow, a necessary caveat to introduce many movie-goers to the world of Dune. Despite this, by the second act, the plot picks up, and you are instantly thrust into the immersive and thrilling storyline. 

The plot, though honestly a bit antiquated in many ways (such as the clear Jesus archetype of Paul) and a bit confusing, is very much as close as you could get to a modern adaptation of the eponymous novel in cinema. It still holds up today, an incredibly exciting and intense conflict between the House of Atreides and all of the other independent factions.

Notably, I found Timothée Chalamet and Oscar Isaac's portrayals of their respective characters provided some life to the characters and their struggles. The ensemble, though the striking lack of Zendaya was upsetting, provided for characters that you could love, understand, and root for. For example, I'm happy they emphasized the relationship between the Duke's son and his father's right-hand man Duncan (played by Jason Momoa); there was so much love and emotions between the two.

Of course, any review of Dune would be amiss to not mention the animation and CGI. Clearly, jumping off of the work done in the 1984 adaptation (which, to be fair, for its time was quite revolutionary) led to a film that, even despite its budget (which was even less than Marvel's Black Widow), had incredible graphics and cinematography. All of the CGI, whether the simple energy field of the shields, the remarkably vibrant sunken sand, or the dragonfly aircraft (which I am mentioning again because of how awesome it was), truly added to the sci-fi world. Honestly, I'm just happy for a film that rejects many of the traditional science fiction elements overdone in the genre (e.g. anything in Star Wars). 

Yet, I have to talk about what I consider to be the crowning aspect of the film: the cinematography. It's literally a movie called ""Dune"" that 99% takes place in a barren desert full of sand; it's a miracle that the filmmakers made it look beautiful. Both the wide shots of the distinctive Dune landscapes or the close-up shots provided for a movie that can be easily appreciated for not only the wonderous, immersive world but also intimate to the characters.

In short, Dune is a movie easily adored by geeks in its genre, but also, can be appreciated by the more traditional blockbuster watcher. The lore, intense and engaging plot, characters, and beautiful animation and cinematography provide for a wonderfully enjoyable film with its watchers clamoring for the sequel.",Jeremy N,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 20, 2021",Jeremy N,/user/id/979056477,RT,979056477,

4.0,"It's good but they could have cut out at least 45 minutes of sand and sky. That said, it is a Disney movie antidote. There are whole stretches of silence, and emoting, without continuous peppy chatter or jump cuts. The villains are mysterious rather than clear cut, and the taking of lives is never slick and easy. When the battle scenes come, they are atmospheric rather than in your face. The critical look at our world's many failing systems underlies the narrative but does not dominate the storytelling. Best of all, the female characters are there from the start and hold their own.

4.0,"Dune is a world that has been on my radar for years now but I never delved deep into it, mostly because I wanted to read the book first whenever that time comes. When Denis Villeneuve, one of my favourite contemporary directors, took the reigns of a new adaptation of it, and it finally got released recently, I knew it was time. The sci-fi story, without going into details and spoiler territory, is set in a possible future many 1000s of years from now and is centred around House Atreides, one of several great houses and the son of the duke, as they are tasked by the emperor to take charge of the desert planet Arrakis, where a crucial and rare mineral is extracted, in place of another house. Things don't go as planned when they get there. 
-
This is one of those rare occasions where I have read the source material and I was ecstatic to check out this film to see how that world is brought to the screen with the help of modern technology. To no surprise for me knowing Denis' previous filmography, the film is an audiovisual treat. I do hate the fact that I didn't have the luxury to check this out in cinemas, let alone IMAX. Still, watching it at home on my average Home Theater, I was enthralled by how the universe created by Frank Herbert was brought onto the screen in a sublime seamless fashion. Whether it is shots of landscapes, cityscapes, planets, massive futuristic vehicles, the sandworms, indoor spaces, all of it looked wonderful with top-notch CGI. The imagination at display from the source material was awe-inspiring and the love for it was shown in taking the time to let the visuals breathe instead of haphazardly throwing in stuff and rushing to the finish line. The word EPIC does get thrown around a lot but this is one of the few occasions where it aptly fits and then some.
-
Accompanying the visuals are the top-tier sound effects that can give you an eargasm and a fittingly strong score by Hans Zimmer. Sure, you do get the usual BUWAAAMS but on a whole, I enjoyed the uniqueness/freshness of Zimmer on this one from his norm. Kinda liked how it felt for Interstellar, although not as amazing. 
-
There are a lot of characters and the casting for many of them was really good. I loved Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto, he fits that persona so well and I so wish there was more of him. Rebecca Furgeson as Lady Jessica was awesome and had one of the best performances in the film. Stellan Skarsgard as the Baron Harkonnen was a stroke of genius, so imposing and effective with the accompanying visuals. Havier Bardem as Stilgar was friggin amazing and I can't wait to see more of him in Part Two. Timothee Chalamet as the protagonist Paul Atreides was another strong one although when compared to veteran actors, he did stumble here and there but also had some GREAT moments. Plenty of well-casted actors for characters from the book. 
-
Unfortunately, even with the 2 and a half hour runtime, characterization was weak. So many characters didn't have enough screentime to be fleshed out properly and some got completely shafted, for example, Piter de Vries. Some story beats also suffered. Still, some of the writing was commendable that even with a lot of material to adapt, most of it went through quite well even if I was wishing they made the movie a full 3 hours long. The omissions made and sacrifices for the dialogue wouldn't have been an issue then. 
-
Now, it is not apparent from the promotional material but this is Part One of the experience that roughly covers 55% of the book, so keep that in mind as the film just sorta ends without any satisfying conclusion. I'm so glad that Part Two has been announced, so now we wait for that... it's gonna be excruciating. 
-
Overall, despite some issues, I loved it. It's a faithful adaptation from someone who genuinely cared for it. A grand-scale epic serious sci-fi adventure that you don't really get anymore. It's probably the best audiovisual treat I've gotten since Denis Villeneuve's last sci-fi outing i.e Blade Runner 2049 (absolutely love that film).

4.0,"Dune is the remake by Dennis Villenuve based on the science fiction book of 1965 by Frank Herbert. The film does not tell the full story, setting up future sequels which means this film is mostly set up. That hurts the movie a bit as it features a very slow pace and not as much action. Yet Villenueve creates some of the best cinema in recent memory. The cinematography is incredible with beautiful locales featuring mountains, grass, and no pun intended dunes of sand that transport us to this universe. The world feels grounded in reality and is epic to behold on the big screen. Timotee Chalamet who continues to grow and mesmerize as an actor does a good job here playing a young prince who is destined for greatness yet there is still much left to be desired and well see how he handles himself when the sequels come about. The strongest roles here are those of Rebeca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac as a couple and parents of Timotees chalamet. They dont always have great chemistry but as veteran actors there able to pull off raw performances with great emotion and tenacity. This movie however is mostly the lore and visuals. Is clear this movie inspired star wars and many modern science fiction movies but since star wars is now embedded in our cultural psyche is hard to watch this movie without falsely thinking is ripping off George Lucas space opera even though is the other way around.Even though is frustrating that it left a lot hanging the movie is filmed incredibly setting up what will hopefully be an incredible sequel.",Jean L,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 18, 2021",Jean L,/user/id/2fc79fd5-2f4e-4be4-9832-1701d563cd25,RT,2fc79fd5-2f4e-4be4-9832-1701d563cd25,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002538517746/picture

3.0,"While it is true that this movie follows the book more closely than the David Lynch debacle, I wasn't as impressed as most folks. This movie was like Tron with better visuals: lots of long-tracking shots and people walking in V-formation for no apparent reason. The costumes are great most of the time (except for one scene where two main characters wear cloaks that a)came from nowhere and b)aren't really necessary in desert heat--but that's a little thing). On the other hand the sound design sucks. The soundtrack is a series of antonal chord layered atop atonal chords then brought to a ear-splitting crescendo...most of the time for no apparent reason, like the stairways in the Winchester House. And it is unrelenting, probably for effect, but I was just annoyed.

Also please tell Denis Villeneuve and Rebecca Ferguson that whispering isn't acting, especially when you have to compete with earsplitting soundtracks. There's an actual scene where it is just Paul and Lady Jessica whispering to each other but they are buried together under a ton of sand, so who might be eavesdropping? No one. Why do people whisper? To talk so anyone eavesdropping can't hear you. But when you are buried under sand, no one is eavesdropping, so no need to whisper. I hate it when movie elements defy the internal logic a movie should have.

Dune is a visual and narrative masterpiece, every shot of this movie is absolutely breathtaking. There's not a moment in the movie where you're not looking at something beautiful. Dune takes place thousands of years in the future where Humanity has colonised the ""Known Universe"" and is controlled by a feudalistic imperialist society, ruled by Great Houses, all of whom are loyal to the Emperor. The story revolves around House Atreides when they are sent to the desert world of Arrakis, or Dune, to take over from House Harkonnen, but when the Harkonnens attack and retake control of Arrakis, the survivors of House Atreides flee into the dunes in a race for survival. In the midst of all of this are the Fremen and the Shai-Hulud (sand worms) that are the hostile natives to Arrakis and House Atreides must ally themselves with the Fremen if they hope to survive and retake the planet from the brutal Harkonnens. Dune is a masterfully crafted story, with great characters with understandable motivations backed up by an incredible cast.

0.5,"The CGI in Dune was nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. This much is true. Having said that, their budgeting team can only be described as too incompetent to manage even a 5 year old's lemonade stand. Their extensive spending on CGI and the cast in this movie left it devastatingly devoid of any plot.

The first sign that something was about to go terribly wrong was the appearance of the words ""Part One"" in the title screen for this movie. It was a feeling akin to watching a family member you have never met get lowered into a grave. As someone going into this movie with no preconceptions other than other people having said that it was well worth the watch, this was quite disconcerting. 

The music was indeed beautiful, thanks to the mastery that is Hans Zimmer. Yet during scenes with whispered dialogue this same music was excruciatingly loud. I can only imagine that the sound engineer was huffing spice throughout the entire process, as that is the only possible explanation for the absolute horror and confusion that I experienced while trying to hear the few plot points spoken at all in this train wreck that you can't seem to look away from.

What little dialogue you could hear was simply disappointing, as the majority of the lines spoken in this movie have the general tone of a five-year-olds first attempt at screen writing a play for their elderly grandparents. Not even Grandma would approve of this atrocity. She would likely say ""maybe screen writing isn't for you"" with a look in her eyes that is typically only seen when a child is about to be ex-communicated from the family.

It is genuinely astonishing that this ""movie"", which was RECOMMENDED by a ""friend"" as ""phenomenal"" and ""one of the best movies they had ever seen"" somehow was given the green light by not one, not two, but many people in Hollywood who should have been willing to toss a life-saver out to the poor fool who ever thought that this would be even half decent. Sincerely, I hope that every executive that signed off on this loses their job and has to dumpster dive behind In-N-Out to get by for the foreseeable future.

After spending an agonizing 150 minutes wondering when this misery would end, there was a glimmer of hope that our ordeal was finally over. The light at the end of the tunnel was shown, as the movie seemed to move towards a conclusion. And yet, when the credits rolled, I was left more confused than a Floridian hooker in a ballroom.

The silver lining of this experience was that I paid only $6.36USD for admission. Had I paid any more than that I would likely consider taking a long walk off a short pier. I am on the floor of my room right now praying to whatever god may be out there that my wife does not find out that I paid money to see this ""masterpiece"".

4.5,"This Dune film succeeds at adapting one of the most quintessential science fiction books.  The movie is as much a visual and auditory experience as it is a vehicle for storytelling.  The fantastic scenery is matched by an endlessly incredible and immersive soundtrack, often more sound effect than score.  

Dune succeeds at presenting one of science fiction's first goals; making us feel small in an enormous and uncaring universe while also asking us where our meaningful place is in it.  

The narrative deviates in a meaningful manner from many other sci-fi stories.  There is a considerable emphasis placed on a transgalactic feudal system.  Eight thousand years in the future, and people are still exploited for their labor.  Lives are cheap and spent at the whims of the ultrawealthy.  

War is primarily fought with individual soldiers fighting hand to hand with blades; this further supports the motif of the feudal age.  The reason for this development is personal shields which negate the efficacies of firearms.  Most of the narrative has a level of technology much lower than one might expect from sci-fi.  This allows the film to focus on relatable people being at the center of the story.

Almost every scene of the film is given a long time to breathe; this allows for a richer emotional experience.  It also supports the feeling of insignificance and isolation in a vast, uncaring universe. 

The pacing of the film drags as a result of that choice.  However, it was undoubtedly the right decision to make this movie just one-half of the eponymous book.",R.J. E,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 17, 2021",R.J. E,/user/id/979147760,RT,979147760,

Jason Mamoa and Oscar Isaac played the only two characters that have some sort of semblance towards being actual characters. While the entire cast is very talented they aren't given a lot to work with since the characters have maybe one emotion each. We can't really blame the actors for how bland and uninteresting the characters are because the book forgot to give everyone personalities too. We can't even say ‘the visuals were amazing' anymore when talking about a movie like this because honestly when aren't they nowadays. Try to think of any sci-fi movie that wasn't visually stunning that came out in the past five or so years.

4.5,"There is some peril in finishing a book for the first time two weeks before the movie comes out and absorbing almost anything you can about the book with the remaining time. Impressions are very fresh, as are ideas of what is crucial to include in a faithful adaptation. Sure, I'd seen Lynch's version long ago, but as much as I think that version is a beautiful disaster in its own right, it certainly was not where my lasting impressions arose after reading Herbert's epic.

Throughout and immediately after the movie, my first impression was that Villeneuve had curiously accomplished the feat of capturing brilliantly the subtleties that give meaning to so much of the novel, but had left out some important centerstage events. But as I walked to my car, most of these complaints melted away. After reading some reviews (Dargis and especially Klion were very sharp, among some less so) to help collect my thoughts, I was settled that many, though not all changes were in fact for the better. 

In many ways, the subtleties are more important, and beyond that, most of the changes make sense in a major commercial adaptation, upon further reflection. It is impossible, after all, for a movie to try to convey everything a book does on a book's terms, and Dune (the film) mostly does a great job of finding ways to show, not tell. 

I still might have preferred the three-hour version of this, with a little more time spent on the intrigues of Arrakeen before things start blowing up. And Josh Brolin is probably not ugly enough to play Gurney Halleck. And I might have enjoyed more time spent between Paul and Thufir Hawat. But the last two gripes are minor and the first is tolerable, especially as any adapting director must figure out the right balance to sustain his movie's ecosystem. 

Beyond the script, the visuals were incredible. Few can match Villeneuve's mind for concepts and piecing together just how things would look. In many cases, he puts that skill to use in a way that allows the production design to do some of the exposition stripped from the dialogue. Zimmer's score is fantastic in its simplicity, relying mainly on just a few riffs that perfectly fit their setting. The performances, besides Brolin's not-quite-angular-enough-in-my-mind face, leave little to be desired, though it will be interesting to see if Chalomet can muster the detached gravitas that the second half of the story requires. 

Really worth seeing on the big screen, if for nothing other than the visuals. To the best of my knowledge, I saw it on the biggest in Tennessee. I reserve the right to raise this rating by half a star as I marinate more on it, but right now it's two in the morning and I just wanted my thoughts out of my body.

ETA: I am taking advantage of my reserved right to raise this rating to 4.5. I read almost as many words about this movie and previous attempts to film Dune and the book itself as are contained in Herbert's tome. Certainly, more than I've consumed about any individual movie in recent memory. If this interest in taking in more wasn't enough to suggest that I thought the movie was special, the fact that I consistently found myself agreeing with the positive reactions and furrowing my brow at the negative was.

This bit of meta-reflection along with a growing sense that the score might have been Zimmer's magnum opus, that Rebecca Ferguson was truly special, and that Villeneuve's changes did not sap much from the meaning of the book all push me towards the higher rating. All of this being said, I reserve the right to change my mind as I inevitably absorb more and more in the coming days and weeks and years until Part Two.

Oque eu posso dizer que sim, gostei do que assisti. A 1ª impressão, que o filme foi rodado com a intenção de ser feito em duas ou três partes, tanto é que quando começa o filme já esta escrito ""parte 1"". Onde trabalha a estória do protagonista e todo elenco. Desde que ele é um príncipe ingênuo e a transformação até ganhar uma maturidade e espirito de guerreiro. Com a perda do pai e do reino. Timothee interpreta bem seu papel, sentimos envolvidos na trama. Além dele outra que tem boa participação é Rebecca que interpreta mãe e a que esta sempre ao seu lado para sua formação. Outros atores tem participação menores na trama. Ela traz aquela estória parecida com de #starwars não há como não compara-las. E vários outras tramas, principalmente onde tem o protagonista tendo sido roubado seu trono, o rei assassinado e onde sempre há toda aquela traição e depois a busca de vingança e reconquistar seu trono. Em tantos filmes medievais, samurais, chineses,....... Apesar de não se tratar de um roteiro novo, toda produção surpreende, os efeitos especiais, o som de Hans #espetacular a #foto uma produção digna de #hollywood Mas não espere um filme de #ação e #aventura 100% do tempo, na verdade o filme e cheio de fala, dialogo para que possamos compreender a estória.

5.0,"Dune, Part One:   I don't read many books more than once. I first read the Dune trilogy in 8th grade.  I barely made it through the complexities and sophisticated intrigue of the narrative  but when I did, it went on my trophy wall of books read. Since then I have read the trilogy three times. It is not an easy read. Herbert makes you work. Dune is consistantly ranked in the top five of science fiction works ever written. All that said, I liked the movie. I liked it a lot. I liked the casting, the editing, Zimmer's music, Villeneuve's vision and directing, the look, the feel, etc. It is quite beautiful but, I suspect  the uninitiated will need to work hard to access the story.  This is not Star Wars. This is a political, religious, and philosophical drama that is tighter and more interesting than GOT. The movie plays as subtle as the source. If you liked Herbert's book, or the films Sicario, Arrival, or Blade Runner 2049, also directed by Villeneuve, you will probably like Dune as I did. (Kid's? Nah. Way too sophisticated and slow paced by today's attention spans. Some PG 13 violence.

For me, though, the characters just feel too damn hollow and joyless to care what happens to them.

This movie is definitely competent, but I can't help but feel after watching it that it was a mistake to try to adapt the first book in two parts like this, since it leaves this one feeling incomplete. I feel like I'll probably like this movie even less as time goes on, because it's just not interesting for me to watch. Everyone is so dour and serious, and the color palette is really muted.

The new version, despite vast sets, CGI, and star power, only offered one scene that sticks with me three weeks later: Javier Bardem's introduction to the Duke.

I expected a more slower movie just given the source material and it being part 1 of a dense book but I felt the pacing was perfect and really picked up. Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin were two badass characters, hope to see more of them.

Oscar Isaac is a beautiful man and a wonderful actor and both of them are on display in this movie.

Well I can say now with confidence Dune is a great film and they were right to go with Denis Villeneuve's vision of Frank Herbert's work. I've seen others say it and I agree this feels like the Dark Knight take on Dune. Not nearly as crazy or as outlandish as other attempts this adaptation choses to scale back some of the expansiveness & craziness of Dune and focus on just the beginning of the of young Paul's story. It also has quite possibly one of the most original soundtracks I've heard in a while which chooses to go in a more ambient & Avant guard style instead of a heavy orchestral space opera we would have all expected.

Dune is one directors attempt to see how big, epic, sweeping and grandiose a movie he can make. What it became is 3 hours of absurdly long close ups, constant shots of stars posing, endless somber conversations in hushed tones and a confusing incoherent script. This movie is a preening mess.
Sword and knife battles are the standard even though ultra high tech devices and  space ships are everywhere.

Key characters are left out from the plot (Im looking at you Fayd Rautha) and the others are weakened when in the written story they are so very much stronger.

4.0,"Dune is a visual spectacle that manages to adapt Frank Herbert's book to the big screen without getting bogged down with exposition which would bore the watcher, however it does suffer from some of its characters not being given enough time to be truly fleshed out and definitely feels like part of a series of films and not something that stands out on its own.

Denis Villeneuve does an excellent jobs of creating a world similar yet different from our own and really transports you into it, with a perfect blend of gorgeous visuals and brilliant camera work, the main character of Paul Atreidis played by Timotheé Chalamet is the most fleshed out character in the whole film with the films basically surrounding his choice to decide the destiny that he'll take and finding who he truly it as a result, which is an excellent story ark for sure. Duncan Idaho played by Jason Mamoa plays an excellent mentor figure to Paul and is probably one of the best secondary characters in the whole film, Oscar Issac gives a magnificent performance as Duke Leto Atreidis and truly brings out a sense of prestige and nobility but also a man who has found himself caught in a trap that he has no way to escape, being given Arrakis not out of gratitude but so the emperor could do away with his house by invoking the hostilities between the Atreidis and Harkonnen. Speaking of House Harkonnen, Stellen Skarsgård gives a monstrous performance as the menacing and unhuman Baron Harkonnen and the prosthetic work done here has to be honoured as well for bringing this character to life. The Freman are also interesting and are well fleshed out but most of the other characters go underutilised and as such underdeveloped and the films could've benefited massively if it had given them more time to be fleshed out.

All in the only setbacks I see in this movie are in the development of certain characters which is the only thing holding it back to me but all in all I would suggest you go watch it on the big screen just to witness the visual extravaganza that it is.",Eoin  D,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 14, 2021",Eoin  D,/user/id/979234064,RT,979234064,

1.0,"If you have read the book/books you will be highly disappointed, it didn't follow the book well at all. I was super disappointed with ""PC Hollywood"" changing the gender of a main character (Dr. Kynes). After that it made it hard to enjoy the movie because obviously the aim was not to try to be authentic to the book. 

Rebecca Ferguson is a beautiful, talented actress, but how she portrayed lady Jessica was way off. Lady Jessica in the book is a very strong, confident woman, the movie version was an emotional basket case. I would blame the writers/director for that, not her acting ability. I like the actor who played Paul, Jason Mamoa was solid, They didn't build Gurney's character enough (Josh Brolin). 
There was no explanation/introduction to the overall plot/theme of the setting of the Dune universe (such as what a ""Mentat"" is and does, the navigators, the sisterhood, etc. All essential parts of the story to just be blatantly left out. The original movie did so much more with so much less, and at least did its best to follow the book in the time allowed. This didn't tell hardly any of the story and they wasted a whole 2 and a half hours on it. Maybe if you haven't read the book/books (I have read every book in the Dune Universe), you might kind of like it if you didn't fall asleep through the first half or the last half.

4.5,"So as you guys have probably heard the visuals for Dune are absolutely fantastic. The use of wide shots to establish the vastness of not only the planet they're on itself but also just the vastness of the governing powers is so fantastic. The visual effects fit so seamlessly into the world. The design for the lighting is wonderful, and the design for the costumes throughout this movie stays absolutely phenomenal through and through.
The story does get a little complicated, the use of some of the flashbacks in the film is a little jarring at times and makes it hard to keep track of everything that's going on at that time. There's a lot to take in as it's the establishing movie of what I assume is going to be a trilogy and so this interruption, while does give us some very needed details, can cause the overall story to get a little hard to keep track of.
[8:27 PM]
I think Hans Zimmer did an awesome job at tone setting with the music throughout the entirety of the movie. I don't think there was a single time where I thought the music was out of place or fell flat in its overall tone for the scene.
Sound design was also absolutely wonderful with some obvious foley work here and there but with some very well-thought-out sounds for some objects that obviously don't have sounds. Like forcefields and such. The sound orchestrated for some of the larger-scale battle scenes solidified and justified the size of the sounds with explosions having a lot of impact through the film.

Expansive. Majestic. Innovative.

Loved the choreography of fight scenes. Loved how the story of power politics was told in a slow-building but deeply intriguing way where a large set of characters were introduced in a well-placed and logical sequence, so understanding the main plot despite the scale of the story was almost effortless.

It was defiantly easy to see how George Lucas used Dune as his source material for his Star Wars Universe. Only difference is George knew how to tell a story. However, Denis Villeneave was not able to do Dune justice or tell a story worth watching or even make you care about any of the characters.

4.5,"""Duna"" is immediately impressive at first sight for the grandeur that its brilliant director Denis Villeneuve wants to convey, and he succeeds, in every aspect, whether in its controversial soundtrack, in its visual and practical effects, and even in the costumes and direction.

""Duna"" is the second film adaptation of the classic book by Frank Herbert, considered one of the fathers of science fiction, I have not read the book to judge his adaptation but we can feel the grandiosity of the story simply by its narrative arcs, and always remembering, that this ""Dune"" is part one and was adapted only halfway through the first book, that is, we still have many stories to live, but the script is not perfect, not because of its plot itself, but because of some narrative choices , I felt a lack of deepening ties between the most important characters, in addition to a weak ending in relation to the whole that was being built - although it is not a real ending - another point is a repetition of ideas that work but leave the film a little dragged.

Visually, I thought it was amazing, the costume connotations are fantastic, especially the feminine ones, the makeup is also good, the epic and confusing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer works well, at least from my point of view, it was clear that Villeneuve gave total creative freedom for Zimmer to compose, the soundtrack sometimes steals some scenes from the movie, not necessarily in a good way, but the strangeness of the music harmonizes with the grandeur of the scenes, at times it even reminded me of the classic ""Akira"", and about the scenes, I thought the work with open shots is fantastic, I like constant contemplation, close-ups, Villeneuve knows how to work with the camera very well and this is evident in this work, every art direction is amazing, the only point that for me is not perfect is the photography, which permeates with its gray tone throughout the film, at times works well and at others we feel like we are missing something, like the scenes in Dune themselves that called for a warmer photograph. Another point of discussion is the weak battle scenes, it is true that much due to the technology of the Dune universe that influences too much at this point, but even so, the choreographies are weak.

The dune cast is very good, especially the support one, I had a skepticism with the duo Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya but as far as possible they work well, but who steals the scene here is Rebbeca Fergusson who plays a fantastic character, one of the pivots of story, a broken and menacing figure and the Swedish actress delivers a fantastic role, by the way, the cast full of stars is really good.
For a few years I've been saying that Denis Villeneuve is the best dieter of the new generation – although now he's not so young anymore – the Canadian director simply doesn't have a mistake in his career, quite the contrary, he just has great successes, and Duna is another one of them , the plot complexity combined with the exquisite direction, full of mysticism and details sell the work to perfection.

Atmospheric, a pleasure to watch, and rewatch.

2.0,"What is so hard about telling this story? This is another miss. The music was great! The story was loosely butchered. The Director claims to be a devotee. My guess is that the translation he got was truncated or the details he recalls are blurry because several of his other efforts are great.

I can see the possibility of 6 episodes from the first 3 books. I can see this as wise. I doubt that they will come to pass.

This was visually austere where is was not so in the book. This was dark and desaturated on a planet with no clouds. Set design was just uninspired and rather plain.

Calaban looked like Scandinavia without trees instead of a warm wet and inviting place like Italy, Brazil, or Northern California.

The glossing over of the Shadout Mapes ( along with all the other female characters ) was wasteful -- and I'm an old guy.

There was very little investment in Jessica's character -- her power, vigor, danger, deep affection and the way this reflects on all Bene Gesserit. If Jessica were portrayed as a low-born with sweeping influence and strength -- how much more significant her subjugation by Gaius Helen Mohiam. 
I am not a feminist but this was a opportunity to put big points of many different kinds ( narrative and -PC- social commentary ) on the board that was overlooked -- WHY?

The writers interpretation of the kidnapping of Paul and his mother was abbreviated and rather colorless.

There is a marvelous soliloquy for Liet Kynes that disappeared.

This failed in the last fight scene to give us any idea of the culture we are visiting, barely touching on the things they value and hold sacred -- also it was staged outdoors -- WTF?.

So we have pretty good special effects and lame writing -- par for the course. Stunts are OK and the music is good.

We needed to see more investment in Duncan Idaho, too. For reasons that will be evident to anyone who read the first six books.

I don't think I will live to see another effort at this literary masterpiece.

3.5,"Dune, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Dune opens with a lengthy sequence of scenes introducing us to Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), his son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), and Paul's mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is of a secretive order known as the Bene Gesserit.  We meet their trusted retainers, and find that they are about to leave their current fief (the planet Caladan since this is the far future) for the rich, but dangerous desert planet of Arrakis.  Paul faces a painful test at the hands of Lady Jessica's former Bene Gesserit teacher, and we begin to find out more about the purposes and powers of that order.  Upon arriving at Arrakis the Atreides and their followers quickly work to win over the native Freman, to gain ""desert power"", but before they can consolidate their position disaster strikes.  In the aftermath, Paul and his mother must survive and find a way to regain what they have lost as much as possible. 

The novel ""Dune"", was published in the mid-60's and is considered by many a classic in the field of Science Fiction (SF).  It dealt with the ecology of another world (Arrakis) in a convincing way and to such an extent that it was almost a character in the novel, just one aspect of amazing world building by its author, Frank Herbert.  I read the book many times, first as a teen, and most recently last month as an adult on the far side of middle age.  So, my perspective might be somewhat different from someone who never read the book, but be that as it may below is what I call ""the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", of this movie. 

***The Good***
Given the scope of the book I wondered if the movie could capture it visually in a convincing fashion, and need not have been concerned.  The visuals are beautiful, with well done CGI for the space ships, but more importantly beautifully shot location work, seamlessly mixed with more CGI to make you feel like the movie was really filmed on Arrakis.  

The casting by an large seems spot on.  Some characters, like Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), look quite different than described in the book, but Momoa nails the role wonderfully, and many others in the case, including Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, also get the characters right.  

Finally, the movie retains from the book the love and acceptance of the Duke toward his son, and the willingness to self-sacrifice of many of his men, especially Duncan Idaho.  These were bright moments in a film that had many tragic elements to it. 

***The Bad***
Paradoxically, one of the best parts of this movie is a bit of a weakness, in that it follows the plot of the novel very closely.  If you have read the book you will find few surprises, and very little missing, even if the sequence of scenes or their length and importance are changed a bit.  However, in so closely following the novel, the movie moves quite slow, especially in the first hour, to the point that I was impatient for something to actually happen.  Strangely one item from the book that the movie omitted was a dinner party that served to really show what the civilization of the galactic empire, and Arrakis in particular was like.  Movies cannot have everything from a novel on the screen if they are to be well done adaptations, but that particular event might have been of more help in setting the stage for following action than the all too slow and drawn out scenes on Caladan. 

***The Ugly***
Movie reviews are always subjective, whatever a reviewer says, and this section of mine is particularly subjective as it describes why I found the movie ""Ugly"" at times (that not fun to watch). In re-reading the book for the first time in 20 years I found it somewhat darker and less pleasant to read than I remembered.  One saving grace was the little interludes in which there was humor, joy, or a better insight into a character that made the book more enjoyable for me in spite of some dark themes.   Virtually all of these interludes and dialogue are absent from the movie.  Again, they could not possibly all be present, but retaining more of this would have given us characters we felt like we knew better, and perhaps made for a more pleasant movie.   Below is an extended quote from the novel, that shows how Paul began to take on the role of Duke, and something of the initial nobility of his character, an example of something the movie did not retain:

Kynes stiffened. ""My loyalty's not for sale, Sire."" Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those bluewithin-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul's lips and he said: ""Well spoken. I apologize."" Kynes met Paul's stare and, presently, said: ""No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you're not like them, Atreides."" ""It could be a fault in their education,"" Paul said. ""You say you're not for sale, but I believe I've the coin you'll accept. For your loyalty I offer my loyalty to you . . . totally."" My son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous, almost naive honor--and what a powerful force that truly is. She saw that Paul's words had shaken Kynes. ""This is nonsense,"" Kynes said. ""You're just a boy and--"" ""I'm the Duke,"" Paul said. ""I'm an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond."" Kynes swallowed. ""When I say totally,"" Paul said, ""I mean without reservation. I would give my life for you."" ""Sire!"" Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes meant the word. In this moment he'd give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?

""Dune"" was visually stunning, followed a well written novel faithfully for the most part, and had some well cast actors who did a great job with their roles.

3.5,"October 21, 2021

Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" presents a dilemma for the film critic. On the one hand, it's a patient, polished, and sophisticated science fiction saga, one that's well-performed and the story and emotion of which the filmmakers and cast take seriously. It's their collective belief in, dedication to, and intelligent interpretation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel that will encourage fans of Herbert's work to respond to this ambitious film in kind. I recently read ""Dune,"" and as the movie played out, I found myself once again getting caught up in it otherworldliness, its atmosphere, its mythology, its politics, and its smart yet vulnerable characters. At the end of this two-and-a-half-hour ""Part One"" installment, I was grateful Villeneuve and the studio decided to split ""Dune"" into two parts and take their time with it, because there's a lot to absorb and appreciate. 

On the other hand, and this is where the dilemma comes into play, I can see ""Dune,"" despite its beauteous visuals, superb production values, and strong performances, losing viewers who haven't read the book, leaving them feeling withdrawn, disassociated, and perhaps even betrayed. In fact, I think many non-readers will find themselves just sitting there, bored at first, asking the question, ""Why should I care about these characters or what's happening on-screen?"" 

It would be a fair question, because as much as I felt Villeneuve and his fellow screenwriters, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, adapted Herbert's piece in all the right ways for the big screen, I can't say they make the story immediately accessible to anyone unacquainted with the source. Even I, who read the book just this year, was hoping the movie would offer a high-level introduction to the Dune universe (think scrolling subtitles). As it is, it's put upon the audience to figure out the dynamics of this far-off world, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it will likely put newcomers in a mild state of consternation.

To be fair, all this speaks to the perplexing nature of the material itself, which print makes more digestible because we have the luxury of re-reading pages and passages, parsing words, and connecting the names of people and places through simple spelling. When it comes to the cinema, however, the fast-paced nature of the medium requires filmmakers to coddle viewers more, lest they tune out, and unfortunately, I think ""Dune"" sets itself up for that, at least for its first act.

This wouldn't be the first time a filmed ""Dune"" failed to connect with moviegoers. David Lynch wrote and directed his own version in 1984, and following a tumultuous production, it too had a difficult time winning over anyone unfamiliar with Herbert's book. Indeed, Lynch's polarizing film garnered mostly negative reviews, with many critics citing it as ugly, convoluted, and generally unpleasant. 

I've no doubt Villeneuve's film will avoid the same drastic fate, what with the level of care and detail he and his team have given it, but as coherent as Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker try to make the layered and extravagant narrative, it can't escape some degree of incomprehension. There's simply a lot to process, which is probably why the book came with a glossary of characters, places, and terms that readers could easily reference. 

Movie watchers obviously don't have the same tool at their disposal, so it's probably inevitable any attempt to adapt ""Dune"" for the cinema will result in some viewer puzzlement. And while I do see this is a flaw on the filmmakers' part, as I do think they could have devised a smoother, more welcoming approach toward indoctrinating viewers into this universe, I also think it's a mild enough shortcoming that even non-""Dune"" enthusiasts can still be made to care about the happenings of the plot and characters. It may take their enduring the first act, but it can be done.

With that said, where and what is Dune? Essentially, in the year 10191, humans have spread out across various planets and split off into ""Great Houses."" These House factions fall under the greater Imperium and rulership of Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV (who, despite playing a vital role, doesn't make an appearance in this first installment). The story begins shortly after Emperor Corrino has charged Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides to relocate from his home planet of Caladan and oversee Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, an arid, desert planet that holds the most sought-after substance in the universe: a mélange simply referred to as ""spice,"" which is literally the spice of life for some and the chemical makeup of which is integral for space travel. 

By sending Leto to Arrakis, the Emperor knowingly usurps the planet from the ruling House Harkonnen, which happens to be House Atreides' chief rival. Led by the bald, overweight, and essentially immobile Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), the Harkonnen are an angry, vindictive, manipulative bunch, and the complicated history between them and Atreides immediately sparks conflict on Arrakis.

Bearing witness to the troubling politics and trying to find his own place in all the chaos is Leto's precocious 15-year-old son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), the central hero of ""Dune."" Paul's trepidation and uncertainty about moving to Arrakis coincides with his dreams about a mysterious girl and his disturbing visions of a future war. All the while, he's trying to harness the powers bestowed upon him by his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is the Duke's concubine but not-yet wife. Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a group of female mystics with unique skills not unlike the Jedi's in ""Star Wars."" For instance, she can hijack impervious people's minds, and she has passed this ""Voice"" and other gifts onto her son, who has not yet mastered them.

Just as Paul receives mental instruction from Jessica, he undergoes physical and combat training from the Duke's military aids, including Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and Dr. Yueh (Chang Chen). While accompanying his father, he learns about the history and constitution of Arrakis from Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), the Imperial Paleontologist, who immediately detects Paul's unique intuition and leadership skills. She's not the only one, because in an earlier scene Paul's will power is put to the test by Jessica's mentor, Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), to whom Paul confesses his dreams of Chani (Zendaya), a member of the Fremen, the native and resourceful people of Arrakis who believe Paul to be the savior who will ultimately restore Arrakis as a lush, verdant paradise.

I've thrown a lot at you, but without giving away too many other details, events unfold in the way of assassination attempts, betrayals, kidnappings, sacrifices, long treks across vast desert landscapes, and potentially fatal encounters with giant sandworms. All of these will determine whether Paul fulfills his destiny, and even though we're not quite sure what that is, the developments and conflicts that ensure feel right home in a sci-fi saga of this sort. In fact, one can easily see the parallels between Paul's journey and his fellow genre brethren, not least Luke Skywalker in ""Star Wars"" and Neo in ""The Matrix."" Paul is your typical, ignorant hero, who, in a manner of speaking, must learn ""the ways of the force"" and ""opens his mind."" Interestingly, because Paul's story came out first in 1965, it may have been his formation that shaped the other archetypes we'd encounter so profusely later.

What's remarkable about ""Dune"" is that, despite the plethora of other (and more popular) stories Herbert's novel likely inspired, the still movie feels fresh and challenging. Yes, it can be confusing at times, especially at the beginning, but once story focuses more on the characters instead of the plot, it obtains an emotional resonance, and we begin to care about the people and their circumstances on a deeper level.

Villeneuve is a director who consistently prioritizes the humanity of his projects, even those with high concepts such as ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Arrival."" And here, he once again allows his actors time to respond to their perilous situations, while the actors, in turn, genuinely respond to their predicaments. There's weight and dimension behind their expressions, anxieties, and insecurities, especially those of Chalamet and Ferguson. For instance, when Paul and Jessica find themselves lost in the desert and realize they'll have to imitate the Fremen to survive, we gain a real sense of their fear and exhaustion, and it's details such as these that elevate ""Dune"" beyond just a standard sci-fic actioner. Oddly enough, it feels relatable.

What's more is the screenwriters keep intact the contemporary and historical parallels between the ongoings of the ""Dune"" universe and our own, which Herbert infused throughout his book, with some of the more obvious examples being the ramifications of colonialism, political corruption, and environmental degradation caused by war and technology. ""Dune"" is both subtle and vocal about these subjects, which will no doubt give viewers something to think about and discuss afterward, even if they do just skim the surface.

At 150 minutes, ""Dune"" is perhaps too long. Villeneuve is clearly in love, as he should be, with Greig Fraser's cinematography, Patrice Vermette's production design, and the special effects, all of which render beautifully, but a good 15 minutes could have been trimmed by cutting some of the solely picturesque shots to keep the story moving along more fluidly.

Still, this is very good movie: bold, technically supreme, sometimes poignant, and related with conviction and enthusiasm. I can accept it's not for everyone, despite all its virtues, but even viewers who are not on board with ""Dune"" can rightly accept the filmmakers have done their due diligence to make an ambitious and important film, or at least as important as any science fiction film about dueling tribes and giant sandworms vying for power and territory 8,000 years in the future could be. This movie took a long time to make it to theaters, but it was well worth it. With this first installment now complete, and its heart, humanity, and exquisiteness fully realized, my hope and belief is that ""Part Two"" (tentatively scheduled to be released in last 2023) will be just as engaging, if not more.",Matthew H,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Nov 11, 2021",Matthew H,/user/id/900752652,RT,900752652,

I'm talking people who hate sci-fi and they loved this movie, a testament to Denis' craft and Herbert's story.

This is truly a cinematic masterpiece, the visuals, the sound, the acting, the fact the story is so compelling is the cherry on top of a sundae that's already packed with all the best ingredients.

4.0,"If you're familiar with Dune at all, you should find this relatable and enjoyable. Let me say this. I absolutely LOVED David Lynch's 1984 version. It was a massive undertaking, with an amazing cast, impressive special effects (for its time), and seemed to have everything going for it. 
But, I digress. 
This version may be a little difficult to follow if you're not familiar with the overall story. 1984 had the narrations, asides, and animations (depending on the version you come across) to further explain the minute details. 
This version seems to assume that you already know what's happening, or going to happen. 
It moves along pretty nicely, and definitely leads to a suspenseful build-up. We have heard a lot of talk of Emperor Shaddam IV, but still haven't seen him. Think Star Wars Episodes 4 and 5, with a lot of talk of Emperor Palpatine, but no real sight of him until Episode 6.
The cast was amazing and the scenery was beautiful. This is definitely a must-see for any Dune-enthusiast. Even if you're not, it's still definitely worth a watch. But, you may be a little lost!

(Wtf  was that?)

Dune 2021 is still exactly the slow-burn, atmospheric space opera it was intended to be but now with modern art direction and cinematography that really pushes those elements. 

Granted this first installment doesn't work much as a standalone film and is very setup heavy for a sequel. However I liked the liberties it took with storytelling and my memory is foggy but it also made the narrative easier to follow than previous iterations.

I feel the color tones used really did a disservice in convincing me how incredibly hot, uninhabitable and valuable water is on Arrakis. The film insists on informing me of these things but the super muted and cool tones and lack of heat waves on camera were unconvincing. Villeneuve was so focused on creating this ambience of a grounded, bleak political landscape that it feels like he neglected the immersion of a super heated desert.

I appreciated that the film focused on setting the stage on Arrakis, but not seeing even a glimpse of the Emperor and/or the Spacing Guild felt like omitting huge players in the political narrative and world building.

Anyway, a very good movie otherwise if you like slow burn dramatic space operas with heavy lore. I hope it does well and isn't forgotten like Bladerunner 2042.

With having to no longer listen to the monologues in all the character's heads throughout the movie, like the one in the 80's was a huge improvement.

Not to say they were poorly cast or their acting was substandard, because truth be told, there is no weak link in the chain (personally not a fan of Isaac & he would not have been my choice to portray Leto, but in the grand scheme, he was fine).  Noteworthy casting includes Bardem, Rampling, Duncan-Brewster & Skarsgard.  Beautifully shot, lavish set pieces & striking imagery all incite a sense of wonderment.

I highly doubt any other person could handle a decades later sequel to a highly regarded classic such as Blade Runner, but Dennis managed to make a movie that I like even more than the original. With Dune, he somehow has done it again. Dune is a highly complicated thing to make at this point, with the numerous previous versions and having to work with the book on top of it all. And yet, he somehow created another gorgeous epic that stands on its own in spite of all the other iterations. It is a fantastic vision and feels like a fully realized world, with cultures and mannerisms that aren't explicitly explained or pointed out. It respects your intelligence and allows you to figure out things for yourself, without ever being too much. I was surprised to find out that it was a part 1, and couldn't believe the movie was over when it ended. The 2 and a half hours flew by, but when I recount the film, not too much actually happened.

The dialogue was dumbed down in several places.  They spent far too much time dwelling on Paul's dreams and visions of Chani.  Also, the acting was largely poor.  A few actors  tried to elevate things (Oscar Issac), but most engaged in overacting (more emotion than called for).  I've often wondered if Dune is just too rich and deep a story (especially the first half of the book) to be transferred to any other medium.

5.0,"I wasn't sure if I would like this film, as I am a HUGE fan of the books and even Lynch's film (while not perfect was still a good watch imo) but Denis really hit this one out of the park. There's definitely some missed opportunities with certain characters like Piter and not seeing Gurney with his baliset (hopefully in deleted scenes on dvd), but no Feyd was so disappointing, hopefully in part 2. Those would probably be my only issues with the film. I was afraid from the trailers and how dark everything was would be bad but seeing it (3x now) it was perfect. I thought Oscar Issac's performance of Leto was brilliant, but Lady Jessica was meh. The gom jabar scene with rev mother was definitely the highlight for me. I do wish Denis would have done more to follow the other of events in the book especially with the spy. I liked Skargard's portrayal of Baron however i felt the look didn't capture how its described in the book and in the book he was more sadistic than portrayed in the film. The only performance I thought was lacking was Bautista's. He seemed just going thru the motions for a paycheck. Not like he's a good actor anyhow, Drax is meh already.

5.0,"Dune - 10/10. Denis Villeneuve's long awaited, long in production magnum opus has finally released. And though it feels like it leaves you desiring more to see by the end of the film, the execution and motivation towards the film creates for one of the best cinematic experiences this year. Dune offers up the age old tale of a young person who ends up realizing what their life destiny is meant to be. As he gains this knowledge and follows his somewhat predetermined destiny, the kingdom that his family rules over is burned to the ground. How he rises from the ashes and tries to fulfill his reoccurring dreams forms the rest of the story. This is a film that really emphasizes the whole Imax filming decision. Its literally captivating and throws you into the world effortlessly. You can tell why Warner Bros wanted him to direct, as his influences from Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 are all over this film. Its easy to write off Dune as predictable or somewhat ""I've seen this story before"" category. Many epic stories and films have used the source novel as inspiration, so when you watch the movie you have this sense of familiarity. It doesn't hinder the experience though, as you feel the power dynamics and expansive alien landscape through the lens of Greig Fraser. Timothee Chalamet does a fantastic job of shouldering such a big project. His first blockbuster leading role shows he's got the qualities to be a big time star. Rebecca Ferguson is also fantastic as the warrior mother to his character. Along with him, she helps catapult the story forward. The film is up to the brim with great performances and huge stars, and this is why the film feels like its interesting even during the long drawn sequences at certain moments. This is just the beginning, as they say at the beginning and end of the film. So we shall wait and see what the next parts will hold.

5.0,"This is it people. Dune has finally broken the curse and it has managed to get the adaptation that the source material deserves. Frank Herbert's 1965 magnum opus series has notoriously struggled to properly be translated to film as it was once believed to be a series that can never be adapted the right way. Not anymore. Denis Villeneuve showed us once again that he is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to sci-fi movies. Starting to rival even the master of sci-fi himself, Ridley Scott. From the amazing Arrival (2016), to the underperforming but critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Villeneuve has managed to do the impossible with Dune. And it seems that the secret behind it was that the movie actually covers only half of the first book compared to the 1984 and 2000 adaptations which covered the whole first novel. The actors have managed to step into the characters shoes beautifully. A heavy hitting A-list cast including Timothée Chalamet (Prince Paul Atreides), Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Oscar Isaac (King Leto Atreides I), Jason Momoa (Duncan Idaho), Zendaya (Chani) (you get the idea, star studded cast) bring to life this visually mesmerizing film. While the politics behind the story can be a bit confusing for those who haven't read the books (myself included), the film has chosen a smart way of drip feeding us world building elements instead of bombarding us with exposition. Which made the whole plot easier to consume even if we don't have all the anwers yet (which will most likely be answered in future movies). I've made the mistake of watching the movie at home via streaming and while it was certainly an enjoyable time, this needs to be experienced in IMAX or Dolby Atmos as the sound design is something to behold. You NEED to hear it for yourself. I am now confident that this series is in good hands as demonstrated by the fact that Dune 2 has already been confirmed. For fans of Dune, this is IT guys. And for any people who have even the slightest inclinations towards sci-fi or visual marvels, this is an easy recommendation.

3.5,"I have almost no problems with this movie, but the one problem I do have with it will most likely ruin the watching experience for the casual viewer. My problem? The way the story was adapted. The original 1984 movie did a bad job at adapting the story and if I'm being honest, this one barely did better. For both movies I had people who had read the books and had done several deep-dives into the lore of Dune watching with me. The amount of times they had to tell important information that was excluded from the movie was alarming. Not everyone has such a luxury and if I hadn't myself I would rated it way lower. In short, if you've read the books or watching with someone who did, you will have a good viewing experience. If not, don't bother watching it. 

Also, one minor gripe is the advertising. I thought it was very weird that despite being plastered all over the promotional material and being featured in the trailers, Zendaya was only in the movie for 7 minutes out of the 2 hours and 35 minutes that the move lasts for. I get that it wouldn't have made sense to increase her role in this movie, but really? All that hype for 7 minutes? The promotional material made it look as though she was a main character. I understand this movie is just the first part of the full reboot, so I'm certain the majority of her  screentime will be in the second part, but why focus so much on a character that was in literally less than a half of a percent of the movie.

5.0,"4.09.2021. Venezia. A lovely hotel on one of Venice main islands. 

A late vaporetto to the Lido.

The horror story begins. 40 minutes of anxiousness on boat of whether I will be able to enter the premiere of Dune or not. 

The vaporetto docks and I run for my life to the cinema for the premiere of Dune. They let me in!

I silently find my way to my seat. 

Oh.

Horror story 2: a seat in the first row for an IMAX - filmed movie. 

But at least I was there. And I enjoyed every second of it. 

Before I dive into the real review of the movie, I'd like to give you some advice. Don't come late to Dune and don't sit in the first row.

Luckily, I managed to see Dune once again in Le Grand Rex in Paris and this is THE PLACE to see the movie (but don't sit there in the first row either).

Now that we have that out of the way, let's dive into the review of the movie. Or shall I say masterpiece? Because that is what I really think of it. 

A lot of critics have said, that Denis Villeneuve's Dune is slow, and that nothing really happens in that movie. I didn't feel that way at all. For me the whole screening was full of tension.. I had no idea what would happen next and it kept me thinking ""what next?"". It is true though, that there is not a lot of action in the movie. But is it necessary? It focused more on the discovery and the appreciation of the planet Arrakis and the power of its nature and its inhabitants. It emphasised more on the message that we need to hear in these troubled times - the urge of taking care of our planet and all of life on it. 

It focused less on the action but also on the emotional journey of the main character Paul Atreides, played in a sublime fashion by Timothée Chalamet. 

Focusing on these two matters, rather than on the action is what makes this movie exceptionally smooth and made me think, that this is a beautiful overture to the Dune trilogy (one story in 3 parts). Even Hans Zimmer's music made it feel this way. Every timeless movie needs a recognisable theme music and at first I really felt disappointed not to have heard it in Dune. Then I thought that it must be all part of the plan. This music felt also, as did the whole movie, like a beautiful introduction to a world. This looks to me like a move made on purpose, leaving space for development of both action and music in the next movies.

Denis Villeneuve might become the first director to make every part of a trilogy better than the previous one. 

Some scenes are especially touching, as the one where Paul Artreides is parting home. Not only was this scene making us feel closer to Paul, and made him more human, but it also was visually stunning. The whole movie was breathtaking. Greig Fraser, the cinematographer of Dune, did an incredible job at composing the images for the movie and choosing sharper angles and colder colours for eery scenes. Matching contrasting slow motion with fast action shots and thus keeping the spectator in constant awe. This effect was also due to the perfect symbiosis of image and sound. The music and the voices were just wrapping around the audience, as Hans Zimmer said on his Instagram. The sound mix accentuated the mellowness and the silkiness of the voices and combined it with the music and all the sound effects to create an astounding score.

Beautiful score, stunning cinematography, smooth acting and unique take on the movie - isn't this movie just perfect? For me it had some imperfections, but I don't think it's worth diving into them. I can't call them universal, as opposed to all these good sides of the movies that I've covered.   
There is one thing that missed in the movie in my opinion. One tiny thing. It might be completely personal... My gut felt quite okay after. Let me explain. After movies like Todd Phillips's ""The Joker"" or Bon Joon Ho's ""Parasite"", my whole body was reacting to what I just saw. I couldn't really think of other things without associating them with some scene from the movies and I felt some kind of anxiety when they ended. Maybe it's just the fact that it didn't end on a CLIFF HANGER.

4.5,"After the mixed attempts of adapting Frank Herbert's Dune into live action, Denis Villeneuve's interpretation is not only faithful to the source material but achieves it in spectacular fashion. Dune is a masterclass of modern filmmaking. 
With a star-studded cast, the film was expected to display many of the best performances of the year. Timothée Chalamet brings the necessary gravitas to portray Paul Atreides, one of sci-fi's greatest characters. He is everything expected of a lead protagonist and is quite possibly perfect casting. Another standout is Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen. His performance struck a balance between being a cruel yet cunning leader. This doesn't come across as a caricature but Skarsgård rather commands fear every time he is on screen. However, those excited to see Zendaya will end up being disappointed as she has a grand total of around 7 minutes of screen time in the 155-minute film. The rest of the cast including Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem deliver standout performances across the board. Not one of them feel out of place in this intergalactic epic, they add to the immersive world building experience carefully crafted by Denis Villeneuve. 
Being the director of Blade Runner 2049, another visually arresting film, I had no doubt that Villeneuve could adapt Dune successfully to the big screen. What I had not anticipated, however, was just how impressive the cinematography the film would be. From the first to the last scene, each frame is akin to a work of art. The masterful use of CGI throughout helps bring this universe to life. Villeneuve grounds these fantastical elements by showing them from the characters' perspectives. For example, when we first see a sandworm, Paul is in the foreground on an ornihopter which allows us to realise the massive size of these creatures. As the director said himself, Dune is made to be seen on the big screen. With a score composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer, the film should be experienced with the best sounds system possible as well. Whilst it augments the movie well, the score fails to reflect the subtlety and finesse at which the rest of the film operates. The powerful sounds make for a great experience in a cinema but are ultimately entirely forgettable. However, a film cannot solely rely on visual and auditory spectacle as it will inevitably not hold up over time. Dune balances this with an excellent adaptation of Herbert's plot, making for a gripping and well told story and ensuring the film is not just style over substance.
The biggest problem is the fact that it is only part one of the story. With the opening shot of the film being the title card ""Dune: Part One"" and closing with the words ""this is just the beginning,"" it remains to be seen how this film holds up in the larger narrative. Unlike other multi part sagas such as The Lord of the Rings, Dune ends abruptly and lacks a traditional three act structure within this first instalment. It very much does feel like a first part leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied. The real test will be whether Villeneuve can stick the landing in the next film set for 2023. This should not dissuade you from going to see Dune, made for the cinematic experience, I would highly recommend watching one of the best films of the year so far.",Sulemaan M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 07, 2021",Sulemaan M,/user/id/976953930,RT,976953930,

2.5,"Timothée Chalamet is a fine actor but he hasn't anywhere near the gravitas required to carry a film like ""Dune."" With his lush brown locks falling charmingly in his cherubic face, Chalemet looks like a posh schoolboy from a 1980s Merchant Ivory production, not a natural warrior fulfilling some intergalactic destiny. The special effects in ""Dune"" are terrific (of course) and the cinematography compelling (if a little dark at times) but ultimately ""Dune"" fails to fully succeed because Chalamet just is not right for the main role of Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, underused and overbearded). I've never been Jason Momoa's biggest fan but here Momoa oozes the leading man charisma that Chalamet lacks in his relatively minor role as a loyal warrior in the service of the Duke and his family. Lots of really good actors are involved in this project (John Brolin, Stellan Starsgard, Javier Bardem and Charlotte Rampling among them) but most of them have little or nothing to do. Rebecca Ferguson, as the mother of Chalamet's character, does have a pretty significant role but she's too frosty for the audience to really care about her. Presumably Zendaya, who has a glorified camera, will have a larger role in the sequel. I would hope so because her role here is limited to appearing in some dreams and then, at the sort-of ending, giving Paul a sword for a fight in which the 150 pound Chalamet manages to handily overwhelm a muscular seasoned warrior.

4.0,"A coming of age space odyssey. Dune is an action-adventure story that showcases the true skill of both its director, Denis Villeneuve and its cast. First off, the biggest praise I can give to this movie is its special effects and the computer-generated environments. Whether it's the distinctive interior of buildings, the bright and solitary oceans or the vast and dimly coloured deserts, they're all a sight for sore eyes! Secondly, the writing is just on a whole other level! The intellectuality behind some of the political dialogue is just phenomenal. The way it handles such intricate themes as dictatorship, religion and sovereignty is absolutely extraordinary. The acting was another highlight of this feature. Timothée Chalamet, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård, Rebecca Ferguson, there's just too many to name. All of them deliver exquisite and masterful performances that improve the experience tenfold. One issue that definitely hampers the experience, however, is its story structure. When watching, it's very clear that they have an entire trilogy in mind. The ending doesn't feel satisfying enough and there's barely a climax. It's very evident that this isn't the end, but that, unfortunately, makes this chapter feel unfinished. The pacing wasn't bad but it certainly could've been better. Most of the movie is fine, the exposition and dialogue scenes don't drag on and the action sequences don't end before they've barely started. But towards the end, it feels like there are a couple of minutes of filler. While it isn't a major issue, it's still something that could've been ironed out. On the other side, the score delivered by Hans Zimmer is a jam! Every orchestrated piece is stunning and fits the vibe of the scene perfectly. Whether it's an action set-piece or the exploration of the broad worlds, it's all-encompassing and truly magical. In short, Dune is everything both newcomers and fans of the original novel could hope for. A fantastic interstellar opera that makes you hungry for more.",Stephy S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 07, 2021",Stephy S,/user/id/977669333,RT,977669333,

4.0,"🌑 NON SPOILER REVIEW OF DUNE

Probably the most anticipated scifi film of the year. I had no prior knowledge of Dune going in. I know it was based off a series of books and a TV movie in the 80s. 

As for this film it is a beautifully shot cinematic experience. The acting from Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson is excellent. The story itself is dense. Lots of political moves and betrayals that motivate certain characters. 

The story was interesting but it was very slow in some spots that have you waiting for something to happen. When the action happens it's good. It's not Star Wars or even Star Trek level action but good. As a two half hour film you do feel the length. The ending is definitely a setup for a sequel that I hope we get.

Overall I did enjoy the film but I wasn't blown away. This may not appeal to everybody but it was a very well made film. If you're on the fence about going to the theater to see it you may want to watch it on HBO Max.

1.0,"I saw this movie last night, I read the book, saw the other adaptations, while my girlfriend never saw anything.
We did not enjoy the movie, and, to be honest, I'm happy we could not go to the Cinema, and ended renting it.
The movie was very slow in some parts, added things that did not exist, but, jumped relevant elements and important explainations of the Dune universe. Considering the number of things omitted, you could have made 1 film, not a trilogy. To me, it was simply boring, with useless (in some cases completely made up) fillers.
Also, we stopped several times the movie, because things weren't clear to my GF, and i had to explain things, since noone explained nothing.
If you have read the book, or seen other adaptations, watch this film to make an exercise of what you remember, if you haven't, you will not understand much.

5.0,"As a fan of the books, I was a bit anxious about its scope of adaptation as a live action movie. But in the hands of a master film maker like Denis Villeneuve anything can be done to perfection. So coming to the movie, I totally digged the vibe of the movie throughout its duration. Its a perfect adaptation in terms of creating an ambience (worldbuilding) for the characters to play their party in a vastly complicated story. Surprisingly the cinematography also is on par with the level of direction, props to Greig Fraser, & also the music overall. Hand Zimmer just stepped up his own level of talent with this number. The performances were also great especially Rebecca, Duncan & Timothee. Although it's a fast flowing but repatively slow paced movie, the depth of the characters, the purpose were very plausibly conveyed to the audience. Some lagging in the screenplay was shadowed and even elevated by masterul technical performances. All in all, it's on of the best movies of the year & also definitely one of the best cinematic experience in recent times. Denis Villeneuve is born for movies like dune, blade runner.

5.0,"Excelente película, de lo mejor del año. Esta versión es muchísimo mejor que la del 84 de David Lynch y creo que fue la decisión correcta hacer la historia en dos películas, ya que proporciona mucho mejor ritmo y tiempo para completar algunos de los detalles de esta historia tan compleja. La película se disfruta muchísimo mas en el cine, pudiendo apreciar mas su belleza visual y sonora; esta banda sonora es realmente de otro mundo, gran trabajo del maestro de Hans Zimmer, quien hace que estas melodías no sean solo para acompañar a las escenas, sino que son poderosas notas para hacer sentir el miedo en cada escena, o en cada momento que viven los personajes. La fotografía es sobresaliente y el diseño de producción es excelente. El trabajo de Denis Villeneuve también es brillante, un director de admirar. Por otro lado, sin saber absolutamente nada del universo de Dune, la película me encanto, y eso lo destaco mucho. Aunque a muchas personas les puede resultar lenta y aburrida por su ritmo y larga duración, a mi no se me hizo pesada en ningún momento y siempre me mantuvo entretenido. Los efectos especiales son increíbles, parece que ni se usan y todo lo que se ve es real. Las actuaciones son excelentes por parte de todo el cast, el cual es de otro nivel. Timothée Chalamet, Jason Momoa y Rebecca Ferguson fueron mis favoritos, la verdad la rompieron. También destaco el gran trabajo de Stellan Skarsgård, con ese temerario diseño de su personaje. Por otro lado, el personaje de Zendaya pensé que iba a tener mas importancia en la historia por todo lo que se veía, pero no fue así; aunque en la segunda parte parece ser que se lo vera muchísimo mas. En conclusión, una película excelente que me dejo con ganas de seguir viendo mas sobre este extenso universo, espero con ansias la segunda parte en la que parece que ya vendrán los momentos mas potentes y frenéticos de la historia.

5.0,"I agree with Nate Z's review, at least partially. The first Dune movie followed my reading this incredible book that took Frank Herbert about 8 years to write. That impressed me as to how well thought out the story was. The first movie left me feeling unfulfilled. Really unfulfilled. I had heard that it was cut from 8 hours to fit in to the theaters. So I read the book again and again, 5  times total as well as the smaller sequels a couple of times. With this new addition to the story I was shocked to find out that after 3/4's of the way through it wasn't 3/4's of the way through this book. That meant there was more of the story to come. I hope its a big box office success because it is so well done in telling Herbert's story. Villeneuve has really succeeded in getting the story on film. I sincerely hope he's able to do a second part and even a third if necessary.  At least then in the future one will be able to watch it all in the future. Like I can now enjoy 'Bond' without having to wait a year between books and films. I have to see it in a theater now thanks to what Nate Z said.

I saw the David Lean movie on home video and couldn't follow the plot; it was a mess, but I thought the casting and effects were good (up to a point).
This is a very different film and although I would have liked more back story on the emperor - hence the lack of 5 stars (I assume this is provided in the book which I haven't even picked up, let alone read) - I think there's enough here to provide an epic film which is visually stunning with a great soundtrack. Casting is fine, I think a follow up would answer the critics of any of the leads.
Also I saw it in a 4Dmax cinema which just adds to the spectacle; I would like to see it again in IMAX because the visuals are simply amazing and the set design is worth seeing on a big screen to appreciate the effort put in here.",IAN M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 07, 2021",IAN M,/user/id/978557932,RT,978557932,

5.0,"Going into this movie I didn't know what to expect. I haven't read the book(s). I haven't looked up the lore. I watched part of the 1984 movie when I was around 12 years old and didn't understand what I was watching - and that was over 30 years ago... So I was apprehensive about how this movie would capture my attention, explain to me the story, and introduce me to the characters of a brand new franchise. A tall order. It's a tough job to get right - but knowing the director, actors, and composer had all hit home runs in the past - I was hopeful. By the end of this movie my eyes were full of wonder, my mind was racing with ideas and concepts of this new universe, and my heart was invested in the stories of these new characters! And the score!! Right from the start I was gripped by how unique, impressive, and immersive the music was. It BELONGS to this movie. It is iconic. Well done! The cast is perfect. I soaked up every second of acting and immediately understood their relationships & motivations. The CGI was near flawless. I never felt like I was looking at something that wasn't really there - It was immersive and seamless. Excellent work. I'm so happy that this is a ""part one"".

The acting was excellent which is a skill Hollywood is lacking recently. I havnt read any of the books, apparently there are several, and the story and lore were engaging and intriguing. 

My only problem was that this film did not need the run time it had. There were way too many long shots of different characters looking into the distance. Way too many unnecessary slow motion shots. And I get it, Paul has visions, lets move on.

5.0,"This film is something else; in the very best way. I'd describe it as ""perfectly balanced"" - a slow-ish build that immerses you and engages you from minute 1 with the intrigues of the story; and for a story with so much lore, and technical detail, the film does a remarkably good job of getting that info to the viewer in simple and exciting ways. Obviously, the visuals and audio (esp. the score) are totally gorgeous, the performances are excellent, and the design work is that perfect blend of 'futuristic' but not 'annoyingly futuristic' (i.e. no fluid-like nanotech, no flashy over-designed hologram interfaces, ect.). 

The one thing I would recommend, tho, is to take a hot sec and get a bit of background info about Dune lore yourself before seeing the film - the film packs in a lot of fun cool stuff, and it can't explain it all without ruining pacing and storytelling. Just watch a video or 2 explaining Spice, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, etc. -  'Crash Course on Dune', whatever.
I knew precisely 0 about Dune lore, but I was excited about the film so I watched said videos, and I was able to appreciate the film's story without distractedly wondering why those guys in the background have helmets full of orange gas on their heads, or why everyone uses swords to fight instead of futuristic machine guns.",Alec P,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 06, 2021",Alec P,/user/id/979328259,RT,979328259,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1773842682815340/picture

I think Oscar Isaac has water downed his name somewhat by seemingly taking every role he’s been offered lately. I didn’t really compare the new Dune to the old Dune as much as I did to Blade Runner 2049, which is my favorite Denis Villeneuve film. Obviously the contrast being that Dune is a retelling versus BR 2049 a continuation of Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. Again with both Dune and BR 2049 I call into question some of the casting choices that were made. Some were spot on and others missed the mark, no pun intended.

5.0,"A science-fiction epic that is glorious to behold both spice and sandworm alike!

Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi epic adventure Dune (2021) provides stunning fantasy vistas, thought provoking political intrigue, personable human drama of ascension and fate, and exciting combat. I've never seen a film quite like Dune. Villeneuve blows every Star Wars and Star Trek film out of the water with his epic grandeur of sensational scope, while keeping you involved in Dune's complex lore. Villeneuve proves he is a formidable auteur as he successfully adapts author Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune for the silver screen in majestic fashion. As someone who never read Herbert's Dune book, I was not confused by Dune's enigmatic sci-fi world. Dune is easily the best made and most enthralling picture of 2021 thus far. I'll gladly watch the sequel as I'm entertained by this film, while enticed for whatever comes next.

Timothée Chalamet is compelling as the curious and maturing hero of Dune named Paul Atreides. Chalamet's subtle acting style lets you feel Paul's every expression of pain, doubt, resilience, respect, pride, humor, and courage. He bears a seriousness in his regal manner as well as a quietly contemplative humanity so that Paul is simultaneously esoteric in his royal position and endearing in his humanistic charm. Chalamet truly is the greatest actor of his generation.

Rebecca Ferguson steals every scene as the mysterious, alluring, fierce, and caring Lady Jessica. Ferguson displays Lady Jessica's steadfast devotion to her son Paul Atreides as well as her enigmatic convictions for doing so with spiritual voice magic and brutal hand to hand violence. Ferguson is so lovely, charismatic, and sensitive against Villeneuve's fabulous backdrops. She portrays Lady Jessica with a manic fervor as well as a poignant resolve and regal grace.

Oscar Isaac is commanding as Duke Leto Atreides with his stern manner, but also feels tenderly paternal in his father and son scenes with Chalamet's Paul Atreides. Zendaya gets to shine as Chani in her brief scenes with Chalamet, but is enchanting in Paul's visions of the future. I'm sure she'll have a bigger role in Dune Part Two. Jason Momoa is entertaining and cool to watch joke and murder as the charismatic Duncan Idaho. Stellan Skarsgård is fearsome with his eerie gravitas as the disgusting Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. He revels in his fat suit and oil.

Stephen McKinley Henderson is kind and intelligent as Thufir Hawat. Josh Brolin is tough and intimidating as the no nonsense Gurney Hallack. Javier Bardem is striking and captivating as the Freman leader Stilgar. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is fascinating as Dr. Liet Kynes. Chang Chen says much with a few lines and intense body language as Dr. Wellington Yueh. Dave Bautista is scary and menacing as Glossu Rabban. David Dastmalchian is fun and interesting as the meekly voiced Piter De Vries. Charlotte Rampling is mysterious and disturbing as the space witch character Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. Babs Olusanmokun is terrifying and intense as Jamis, who challenges Chalamet's Paul Atreides to a duel to the death. Lastly, Benjamin Clémentine cameos as the neat space envoy: Herald of the Change.

Villeneuve's direction is impressive as he focuses on attaining striking visuals alongside intricate sci-fi concepts of new technology and perilous space diplomacy. Dune author Frank Herbert's story is as much a coming of age drama as it is a political drama about young Paul Atreides becoming a Duke worthy of his family name, father's pride, and mother's wisdom, powers, and grace. Herbert's ideas also cross into warfare, capitalism, supply chains, and how people and culture affect future diplomacy as much as the spice being mined from planetary deserts.

Screenplay writers for Dune Eric Roth, Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts keep the story grounded with emotional characters and relatable human ideas. I am still thinking about their themes of imperialism and conquests, royalty's transitions of power, family, fatherhood, motherhood, romance, maturity, bravery, and intelligence overcoming treachery. Dune is very intricate in its world's fantasy lore, but Villeneuve helps you understand all the difficult names and strange magical concepts a scene at a time with his patient and entrancing direction.

For a mammoth sized 155 minutes, Dune is made palatable through Joe Walker's tasteful editing that keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace. His sharp cuts from conversations about destiny and serfdom to Villeneuve's visceral combat battles and harrowing sandworm encounters is inspired. What else can be said about cinematographer Greig Fraser's breathtaking ultra wide shots that make you believe in uncharted planets. Every panning shot of vast oceans of water to endless seas of sand and spice are magnificent to behold in theaters. His intimate close-ups feel as thoughtful and emotionally in tune with Herbert's characters as Villeneuve's stellar direction.

Patrice Vermette's production design captures impoverished desert homes on planet Arrakis as well as lavish regal halls for planet Caladan. Karl Probert, Tibor Lázár, Tom Brown, Bence Erdelyi, David Doran, Sam Hudecki, Gergely Rieger, and Borbála Debreczeni's art direction makes these space worlds unique, extraordinarily beautiful, yet familiar enough to appear relatable. Richard Roberts and Zsuzsanna Sipos' minimalist set decoration keeps to Villeneuve's sparse style, while adorning rooms with peculiar sci-fi gadgets and furnishings to keep you looking on in awe.

Dune's visual effects are phenomenally realistic and yet a world away in scale and imagination. CGI artists Michael Lemon, Maricel Pagulayan, Paul Lambert, Brian Connor, Tristan Myles, Lorna Barnshaw, Dan Finnegan, Alvaro Garcia, Frédéric Gaudin, Hamid Shahsavari, Ryan Wing, and Shailesh Chibire outdid themselves with Dune's enormous sandworms, shield armor, missile launches, ship landings, and helicopter take-offs. Dune is the best looking film of 2021 for sure.

Composer Hans Zimmer delivers an ethereal score of haunting melodies and pulsing bursts that will deafen you. I appreciate how diverse Zimmer's music sounds with music from all over the world throughout Dune with his versatile scoring blasting away. I do think the sound mixing is too blasting as my only complaint about Dune, with blaring ship landings and quieter speaking volumes. Overall, I was enchanted by Dune's sound design. Sound effects artists Mark A. Mangini, Ron Bartlett, Theo Green, Lee Gilmore, Doug Hemphill, Bob Kellough, and Dani Connor Wild create startling explosions, throbbing sandworm ripples, piercing screams, echoing inner voices, and eccentric sci-fi noises for all the technology herein.

I loved Dune's cool costumes from designers Jacqueline West, Bob Morgan, Stacy Horn, and Lilla Vasvári. From Paul's black coats and armor to Lady Jessica's flowing gowns. I believe Rebecca Ferguson's ornate ceremonial gold dress may be cinema's most expensive costume in any film to date. Make-up artists Donald Mowat, Jutta Russell, Daniel McGraw, Judit Farkas-Arful, and Kata Huszár keep House Atreides and House Harronnen ghostly pale, while the Freman characters are all warmer browns and tan in color for distinct looks in Dune.

In all, I highly recommend you see Denis Villeneuve's Dune in movie theaters if you can as it is an unforgettable experience of finely tuned craftsmanship and deft acting prowess from a wonderful ensemble cast.",Matthew D,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 06, 2021",Matthew D,/user/id/d755d5eb-f128-4600-b73a-ace69c2f7808,RT,d755d5eb-f128-4600-b73a-ace69c2f7808,

I mostly agree with him. Too bad this film does not make Vladimir Harkonnen a murdering pedophile like he is in the book. This is in the Lynch version, and it makes the antagonist much more repellent, but in today's world, that kind of thing might be too much, strangely. And they do not feature the word jihad like they do in the the book, a central building block of the tension in Herbert's world, because of course that would be way too much, infuriatingly. The spectacle and loyalty to the book in this movie are impressive, but I must agree with quite a few reviewers who say it's a little cold, not much reason to care about what's going on. I also have to agree that this is a work that might be unadaptable. Some of the direct quotes are clunky, they don't translate well. Impressive cinematic achievement, and I love seeing my beloved characters, but the book is light years better. Always will be. I was telling my brother what they were saying with the Litany Against Fear and Shai-Hulud and whatnot. There is a disconnect between the iconic, seminal sci-fi novel of all time's writing and translating it to the screen.

So I watched this the next day on HBOMax, less than a day after seeing it in the theater, and I honestly liked it a lot more.  This was more surprising than how disappointed I was by my theater viewing because of all the people who insisted this was a must-see for the movie theater, myself included.  The difference could be technical, it's still dark and brooding but the room I viewed it in at home was a bit brighter than the theater which makes the screen seem brighter and the sound somehow seemed better which is odd because my sound system is not great.  Maybe it's because I didn't like the audience I was with and how they were seeing it in contrast to how I normally see films.

4.5,"I'm a fan of the original novels and I think this was by and large a fantastic adaptation except for a few things. Am looking forward to the sequels.

If you're watching it in Malaysia, the Malay subtitles are epic because they fully lean into the Islamic elements that Frank Herbert appropriated for the original novel. I saw an essay by Haris Durrani complaining that this had been diluted/dumbed down for the US audience but I really didn't notice because the BM subs were great.

Language does seems to be one of the big hurdles to creating a fully immersive other world here, even though they tried. For example Paul can supposedly speak Mandarin but 5 seconds later pronounces Dr Yueh's name the way a monolingual white Anglophone American would? And Chani (Zendaya) is Liet-Kynes' daughter and half Fremen so she should either have a British accent like Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) and/or a Fremen accent, instead she also has a generic North American accent? Just be consistent, people....

4.5,"Todos los cinéfilos venimos esperando este estreno hace años ya, debido a la pandemia. No solo por la gente que esta detrás del proyecto, sino porque prometía ser el inicio de una nueva saga de ciencia ficción diferente a cualquier cosa que hayamos visto antes. Mis expectativas estaban muy por lo alto y, luego de haberla podido ver en IMAX, debo decir que es la mejor experiencia cinematográfica que he tenido de lo que va el año.

No investigué prácticamente nada de ""Dune"" previo al cine y realmente creo que hace un trabajo impecable al introducir, presentar y hacerte sumergir completamente en este nuevo universo. Desde los planetas, los personajes y sus diferentes casas intergalácticas hasta las máquinas, las criaturas, la tecnología y la fantasía o mística. Todo esta tan bien pensado y llevado a la vida que te dan ganas de seguir descubriendo más y más de este fascinante e interesante universo.

Villeneuve es un maestro de la ciencia ficción y acá hace nuevamente un trabajo espectacular. Eso si, tengo que avisar que esta no es una película de acción frenética con batallas espaciales al estilo Star Wars como quizás muchos imaginan o esperan. Dune tiene un estilo y tono muy diferente y particular. Mucho mas serio, adulto y oscuro. Se toma su tiempo para que conozcamos, no solo cómo funciona este universo, sino también desarrollar a sus personajes y, sobre todo, a su protagonista Paul.

Se siente casi como una Game of Thrones futurista, ya que es principalmente un drama de familias y política que gira alrededor del poder, la traición y la guerra. La novela original es de 1965 por lo que la historia puede que no sea algo innovador, pero sí lo es la manera en cómo Villeneuve decidió contarla. La película es un espectáculo para cualquier amante de la ciencia ficción.

4.0,"This version is better than the '84 David Lynch version.  I believe it was the right decision to do the story in two films.  Dune is an exposition and detail dense story.  Splitting the story over two films provides much better pacing and time to fill in some of the details.  That said, the film still drops, ignores, or glosses-over details from the novel (explaining mentats for example).  But, unlike the '84 film, these omissions do not hurt the film, and in fact help tell the story in this medium.

I made an effort to see this film in the theater instead of on HBOmax.  The film benefited from being seen on the big screen with a nice Atmos system in the auditorium.

While not cinematic story-telling genius, this rendering of the Frank Herbert tale does not disappoint.

Every epic tale of this sort needs strong villains. Skarsgaard is cold, heartless and perfect in this role. 
The actor playing Paul (Chalamet) is such a skinny skeleton of a dude, it's takes a classic ""suspension of disbelief"" to accept him as a formidable fighter and up-and-coming messiah in an adventure movie. In movies of this sort, that is expected, and he passes it off relatively well. In addition, I am always disappointed that such and engaging tale is cut short by a two part movie, and doubly so when I am not prepared for it by any of the lead up media or trailers.

4.5,"This was Part 1 of probably multiple parts of a franchise that has the potential of being top tier quality cinema.

After reviewing the trailer for this masterpiece I went in this movie not knowing anything about Arrakis or Spice or anything about Dune lore. I had heard that it inspired Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones so my interest was peaked.

I have always enjoyed Villeneuve's films, they have a particular style to them that just works. Dune Part One was that kind of film to me. I was immersed in the gargantuan epic scale of the visuals as well as how the story progressed. The flow just worked. Combined with Hans Zimmer's appropriate soundtrack which was definitely in his element of music choice. The music certainly set the correct tone for this masterpiece.

The cast was beautiful and just right for the roles they were playing. Timothée Chalamet stunned me with his powerful acting portraying the role of Paul Atreides. Zendaya does a marvelous job at not being Zendaya and actually made me interested as to who Chani was. Chani is barely in the film because this is only the first part and Paul Atreides finally meets her in the last few minutes of this film. Even though we see only glimpses of her through dreams, she still left an impression at the end.

Jason Mamoa's Duncan Idaho was a fun, charismatic and charming character which left an everlasting impression as well. I actually felt emotionally attached to this character especially when he dies as sacrifice in order to aid Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to escape the Harkonnens. I actually was seeing Duncan Idaho and not Jason Mamoa, that is what it felt like.

The rest of the cast was fantastic, the Emperor was really menacing and definitely sold me the notion that he must go. Bill Skarsgard does an amazing job at this role, simply scary and true to the lore I must add.

Seeing the scale of which the director filmed this, mesmerized me as well as kept me engaged with the flow of the story. I was absolutely gob-smacked by the sheer scale of the Dune giant sandworm Shai-Hulud. It felt like I, the viewer, was actually there and it was truly a terrifying yet beautiful sight to behold!

I am really glad I saw this movie in a cinema and not at home for this was definitely one of the best cinematic experiences to date. Cannot wait for Dune Part Two! Go see this film in theatres, you will not be disappointed!

1.5,"Summary:
   Dune is 2.5 hours of mom & son mumble about space politic in the deserts, with random ads of Zendaya's perfume thrown in.
   First time in my life I watch a movie that tries to captivate the audience with just the good looks of its actors instead of good storytelling, its so unbearable to watch I would just run out of the theater if I could at that time to instantly buy another movie ticket. 
It's a confusing movie, didn't explain itself properly, but just goes with it anyways. Plus the scenery, its all just deserts, as far as the eye can see, most of the time. And what's with the MC daydreaming every 15 minutes, even during intense moments, so stupid.

My expectations were very, very high and I think that Denis Villenueve and the cast did an amazing, amazing job.

Every time a new movie comes out, the director says it needs to be watched in the theatre. It's not true in the 90% of the time. But this one...you really have to just for the sound. It really immerses you into this world.

5.0,"As someone who has not only seen the 1984 version movie, and the both mini series, but also read all six of the original books, twice... I can say that is nearly as perfect of an adaptation as I have ever seen. Dune is one of the most famous literary works of all time, this movie was nearly flawless in both it's retelling of the original story, and scope of vision. Truly the only thing I could even say about it, is that Zendaya only exudes about 90% of the grittiness that I was expecting from her character, but that might just be a one-off, or the tables could turn in the next installment. Not saying she gave a bad performance. The whole movie was good. Furthermore, all of these critics that say the directors are spinning their wheels, over using special effects, hyping too many characters, or spending all the action in the beginning of the movie... Well, they are all wrong, and obviously never read the original book, especially not twice. Every scene, every character, every big special effect is precisely where it should be. If you are familiar with the story, you should come away fulfilled. If you are a new to the Dune story viewer, you should like it, and there will be a lot you do not understand, but you should still enjoy the movie quite a bit. New viewers many want to watch the movie again, watch some youtube videos explaining the plot, or maybe both.

4.0,"On a technical level Dune (2021) is an extraordinary achievement. It's obvious that director Denis Villeneuve plays in the top league. I highly recommend to watch Dune (2021) at your local cinema on a large screen. On the other hand both story and tone  of Dune have been used as a template for several other SciFi and fantasy epics in the past decades. 

As a result the story feels a tad bit outdated to me. If you've seen Dune (1984) by David Lynch then don't expect any big changes storywise. And don't expect Dune (2021) to do for SciFi what LotR did for fantasy (e.g. reinvent the genre).

Yet I still enjoyed it and I'm happy that Warner took on the risk of producing such a marvelous piece of cinema.

2.0,"Granted I'm an older SciFi fan who has read Frank Hubert's masterpieces.  But this version of Dune doesn't capture the sweeping drama and complex characteristics of Paul/ Muabdib and the Dune Universe.  Instead we're given an androgynous, brooding sort who is neither heroic or charismatic.  How does such a character win the hearts and minds of the Fremin people?

4.0,"Dune is a masterpiece of visual storytelling, with an attention to detail and production value rarely seen. The way that they realize this sci-fi world is brilliantly believable- down to the little intricate details of set design, costuming, props, and more. The mixture of practical and CGI effects are indistinguishable, and the result is one of the best looking films I have ever laid eyes upon. Zimmer's epic score shakes the entire theater, making the IMAX experience essential. The acting is fantastic across the board- every single performer is going 100% the whole time- even those in smaller roles. The only issue I had with this movie is the pacing- which will likely disappear as a problem for me once we get the second part of the story. The first half moves along nicely- then the second half slows considerably and never picks up the pace again. I understand this is the nature of the story they are adapting- this movie is giving us half of a very dense book. Still, it feels somewhat unfulfilling to watch this first one on its own. Perhaps that will be a strength in the long run though because it left me wanting to see the next piece of the story (which thankfully was greenlit days after the first chapter premiered).

Timothée Chalamet was horribly miscast, appearing as a wimpy kid and at one time even crying at his fate. Rebecca Ferguson, who played his mother, looked and acted more like an older sister or lover. The original movie went to great lengths to explain not only the origins of the humans, but how the still suits worked, the beliefs of the Fremen, why there were no computers, and so many more details. This movie barely references one of the most important characters of the book, the sandworms.

4.5,"tl/dr: A fairly faithful movie adaptation of the book, with small flaws.  

Having read all the novels and watched all previous such adaptations I found myself hearing the internal monolague's from the David Lynch film while watching this movie.  Which brings me to my one, minor, criticism; a lack of depth.  Dune is visually stunning.  The writting and acting are spot on; the tension and pacing are near perfect to tell this story.  The choice of break point in the narative is appropriate; Paul after his first kill and assuming the responsibility of his title as Duke and understanding for the first time the weight of what that means.  The dialog is sparse, and concise, possibly just a little too much so, to its detriment.  I appreciate the absence of the internal dialogs of the David Lynch film, while at the same time recognizing that their absence leaves the audience with some gaps in knowledge that drain some of the tension and inner conflict from the movie. 

I left the theater feeling like my prior experiences gave a much richer understanding of the world building.  Gone are the references to Kanly and the political gravitas of the conflict between the Harkonens and the Atreides. The Bene Geserit ploting is well represented, but the Guild's involvement is missing, and the Emperor's is perfunctory at best.  This causes the entire film to feel somewhat more generic than something as unique as Dune should.  

Dune, at its core, starts from a position of political intrigues, suspicions, and the members of the Great Houses being constantly on their guard against one another, and even their most trusted advisors and closest friends not being above suspicion.  All of that conflict and the accompanying tension is missing from this film, because none of it is properly introduced.  Like a four-part harmony where the base is awkwardly silent, it is missing part of its soul.  That is not to say there is not tension, but just that a substantial piece of the original narratives basis for the conflict is missing or substantially subdued in this adaptation.

It is still a very good movie, I can not recommend it enough.  It just lacks a bit of the narative depth that makes the series as a whole so interesting and unique.  As a fan of the novels, I definitely enjoyed it.  But, as a fan of the novels, it doesn't hold a candle to the original work, either.  Very good for what it is.",James L,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 04, 2021",James L,/user/id/972627592,RT,972627592,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1043186229035785/picture
4.0,"Zendaya Coleman (Chani) was marketed as one of the main faces of ""Dune,"" despite her seven minutes of screentime. Chani is a Freman, native to Arrakis, and frequently appeared in Paul's visions of Arrakis and the future. Although Coleman seems perfect for the role of Chani on paper, she didn't blend into the role as seamlessly as expected. Her presence in the movie was jarring, maybe because she's such a pop culture icon, but it didn't feel natural. Her minute screentime left her character underdeveloped, 
Chalmet had his highs and lows as Paul. He was more of a messiah than a duke, and some of his fighting scenes were gawky and clunky. He's convincingly young and immature, playing up Paul's teenage angst, and taps into the spiritual side of his role with grace. Some of Paul's visions aren't fulfilled within the first movie, and many viewers found that unsatisfying. His superhuman connection with spice and with Arrakis is very convincing, making him a magnetic protagonist. 
The aesthetics of Dune, from costume design to color palette, give the movie a timeless look. The Fremen wear Stillsuits, which conserve water and help them breathe, and feature the iconic nasal tube seen in Dune's ad campaigns. The suits come in muted colors to match the earthy tones of the movie's palette. The dusty desert scenes, which take up the majority of the third act of the movie, are filmed in a mix of places like Jordan, Budapest and Abu Dhabi. ""Dune"" commits to its neutral color palette with great success. One might think a beige and brown palette would get boring, but the interspersion of sun flares and golden light keeps it interesting. Action scenes seem to pop against the desert background, and when sand flies against the desert sky during fights it looks almost magical. 
Denis Villeneuve directed this 2021 adaptation of ""Dune,"" while Hans Zimmer composed the haunting soundtrack. The film is filled with soaring synths, angelic opera singing and a score that's more than memorable. It sets the tone for the alien feel of Arrakis, a place that looks so familiar and so foreign at the same time. When Paul and Jessica are fleeing a sandworm and Zimmer's theme fills your ears, you truly experience the height of ""Dune.""",Samantha P,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 04, 2021",Samantha P,/user/id/979318656,RT,979318656,

2.0,"After at least three aborted attempts to read the books (zzzzzzzzzzzzzz…………) and years of hearing simply everybody talk about this latest and greatest science fiction story I finally took the easy way out and went to the movie version of Dune.

As far as I can remember it wasn't as long and tedious as the books.

I have always been a strong proponent of reading the book first and then, once you've earned the right, going to see the movie. However, in this case I gave myself an exception, because it's glaringly obvious that I'm never going to be able to slog through all those printed words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters to the end of the story. Just ain't gonna happen, folks.

Therefore, I gave myself permission to cheat this one time.

I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't surprised. I wasn't intensely entertained. I wasn't as bored as I feared I could be. I wasn't especially confused or unable to follow the general gist of the story. I wasn't especially shocked or surprised at the events that were unfolded and presented in the movie. I wasn't dazzled.

Overall, it was generally a cinematic recreation of the orcs and the Rohan from the Two Towers in the strongest, action scenes.

It was a reasonably interesting retelling of the heroics portrayed by John Wayne and the abandoned garrison at the Alamo.

Finally, it had components of Star Wars and the spacecraft action scenes from the battles between the Evil Empire and the Rebels.

In short, Dune had a lot of things that kept reminding me of a lot of other things throughout the entire movie. I don't know if the books were the same. I don't know if I'm just getting too old and jaded to sit back and just let the story take me to other worlds. But Dune never grabbed my attention and took me outside of my theater seat (except the two potty breaks I was forced to take. It's a long, long movie).

4.5,"Dune (2021) is an adaptation of one of the best Sci-Fi novels ever by Frank Herbert that carries the same title. I personally did not read the novel, and I know completely nothing about the story or plot of Dune. However, I have heard things about how the story or plot of Dune is complex and hard to turn into a live-action film as it requires a lot of work and not anyone can do it. Dune has been adapted many times and all of them failed. For instance, David Lynch's 1984 Dune was described as a ""flaw attempt"". However, when it was announced that Denis Villeneuve will be directing the upcoming adaptation I personally was sure right away that he will be doing the best adaptation. And he did.

If you do not know Denis Villeneuve by now then you should. He is one of the best modern-day directors. Some of his films are Prisoners (2013), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and Arrival (2016). As you watch all of his films you'll notice some unique and creative similarities between all of them. For example, the build-up and introduction of the characters or world of his stories. He is the only director who is capable of being brave enough to adopt such a hard and complex story or novel such as Dune. Or create a sequel of one the best and most famous Sci-Fi films after 30 years of the release of the original one such as Blade Runner 2049. And surprisingly all of these films turned to be successful and great.
Villeneuve has his own way of introducing characters and building the world of a story by having such slow-paced films which will seem boring or long for many. Especially in Dune or Blade Runner 2049. But. In Dune's case, many don't know that this is the first part of a two-part film and story (possibly could be turned into a trilogy). However, this method or style of telling a story in a slow-paced way can be done perfectly only by Denis Villeneuve and in a way where it will be entertaining and not seem boring or long.

Alongside that, his use and choices of cinematography, theme or vibe of the film, music, etc.
Firstly, the music in Dune (2021) is composed by nonother than Hans Zimmer, Which felt different and unique this time than other films that Zimmer composed like Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), or No Time To Die (2021) where there are simple action or dramatic scenes. Dune is different and requires different and unique music for that world or story to be delivered, explained, and experienced well by audience members. The music score in Dune feels real, alive, and is speaking to you to deliver the feeling or action that is being shown on screen. 

Dune has a great cast. But, you will be surprised to know that not all of them have enough or long screen time like Zendaya. And again, that's because Dune is ""an introduction to Dune Part two"" so many of the characters in the first part are only being introduced to the audience but will play and have a bigger role In the second part.
Timothée Chalamet plays the role of Paul Atreides and he is the one that we are with him most of the time since we are following his epic and long journey. Chalamet obviously plays the role very well which is not a surprise. Jason Mamas didn't present something new. It's the same type of character shown in most of his films where he is that big strong guy who goes around kicking everyone. But, it is still impressive to see him in the fight scenes especially that he is in most of them. Three roles that I really want to talk about and are a complete surprise. First, Oscar Issac as Duke Leto Atreides and the father of Paul Atreides. You could see the grandeur and nobleness in his walk or on his facial expressions. I have never seen someone who plays the role of a ""duke"" that well. Secondly, Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Atreides and the mother of Paul Atreides. Rebecca plays the role of that frightened mother who is willing to take good care of her son and sacrifice her life for him, and she does more than well. Finally, Stellan Skarsgård as Harkonnen. The makeup and hairstyle department did a great job in creating that weird ""creature"" who you won't know if he is human or a monster whether from the inside or the outside look. His voice, his face, his size, his body are all capable of frighting the audience. 

I really wish if the film was rated R. I feel like the story of Dune requires blood and violence to be able to show and deliver that world that is full of different characters, houses, and families that have or follow these weird different traditions. The film was missing some disgusting violence and blood specifically in the fight scenes and the "" evil villein side"".

The beautiful cinematography and visual effects capture the beautiful world of Dune from landscapes like the beautiful desert with its sand that is designed pretty well and you can see the details whenever there is a close-up or extreme close up shot that captures the sand, and the huge ships and planes that are well designed. The film is considered ""visually stunning"", it's full of shots and still frames that are stunning to look at.
The use of colors and the color palette of the film or each shot is great. The whole film has that brown sand color theme which adds more to the story and connects perfectly to the world and story of Dune.

The sound mixing & editing are well done although sometimes I felt like whenever there is one character that is whispering I could not hear them very clearly. On the other hand, the sound of characters stepping on sand is very amazing. You can lethally hear every little detail especially the film sometimes has scenes that are in complete silence.

Dune (the film itself and the story or world of Dune) is huge. It's a big project that is not easy to be done. But, with Denis and the rest of the crew, they were capable of giving one of the best Sci-Fi films ever. Hope the story and film stay on that great level with the 2nd part or the 3rd one if there will be one. Dune is a story that deserves to be told in multiple parts and not in one film.

My rating is 9.5/10

4.5,"I usually find it unfair to rate films that are based on novels I have read as the inevitable comparison of these two significantly different mediums generally leads to a much lower film rating. It is nearly impossible, at least for me, to experience a better ""film"" than the one we create in our minds while reading a story for the first time but Villeneuve gets closer than most here.

I absolutely loved this film and haven't been that into a movie for a very long time. As it was ending I honestly thought we had a little less than an hr left and was upset I had to get up and leave. Probably needless to mention that the pacing was on point for me.

The shots of the desert mouse (or muad'dib in Fremen tongue) gave me goosebumps and provided one of the many touches of added symbolism found throughout that fans of the Herbert series no doubt appreciated.

I was real impressed with the casting as well and couldn't find a weak player in the bunch. I hesitate to shout anyone out as everyone played their roles well but I was definitely enjoying Brolin's Halleck quite a bit and thought Momoa did one of my favorite characters, Duncan Idaho, a solid service.

The cinematography is to die for, the world building is superb, and I still have never heard a Hans Zimmer score that didn't slap.

5.0,"Saw it in IMAX last night. Always a cult fan of Lynch's Dune, batshit mad as it is. 

But this is next level brilliant. Visually its stunning, the direction is very very strong, keeping performances restrained until the right time when the cast are let off the leash. Jason Momoa steals every scene he's in as Duncan Idaho - his character much more visible compared to the blink and you'll miss it of Richard Jordans appearance in Lynchs version. Although designs are clearly not as mental as Jodorowsky's Dune might have been - seek out the design work of Chris Foss and you'll see what i mean - the clean lines of the Guild Highliner and utilitarian used future look of the spice production vehicles contrasted well. And I need an Ornithopter in my life as who wouldn't want to zoom around in a Dragonfly. 

But its the time taken in scenes and the risk taken in splitting the story that pays off the most. Someone sat behind me at my viewing said it dragged on in every scene...couldn't disagree more. There's a huge story here, we haven't even got half way through what Lynch did - and he glossed over two years of Fremen insurgency with a voice over that was there just for exposition. This version was better for the lack of ""THIS IS WHATS HAPPENING"" audio thought bubbles.

There was quite a lot of dialog that everyone in our group missed... and we were not alone in thinking that subtitles would have been a GREAT help for this movie, and that we will all enjoy it better at home on DVD where we can control the sound and set up the subtitles.  Other than sound issues, I loved how the story is being told, giving us the information that previous movies never did ... and should have.  Even so, telling the story well leaves us with what feels like very little actual story being received by the close of this film.  It has whetted appetites, if not left us a bit wanting for the rest of the story.  The ""Part 1"" gave away that would wouldn't be getting all of the story this time, and that was wise, because we might have been more significantly disappointed had we expected the full telling this time around.  All that said, what we saw was glorious... in detail, visual and sound.  The volume in the theater truly did leave you feeling as if you were there - they could have backed off that just a little.

4.0,"The epic novel Dune is one of the greatest works of modern fiction.  Dune the film is unfortunately not its cinematic equal, not be a long shot.  However, the film has many merits.  Denis Villeneuve stages the film to near perfection, with intimate moments shot against a gorgeous backdrop, incorporating both the epic and the sublime.  The pallet of the film captures the mysticism and epic scale of the book perfectly. The issue with Dune is not what's been put on film by the director's very capable hands, it is in the lack of ambition in actually adapting the source material and core narrative to screen.  Villenueve is terrific at meandering the subtext of the script and filling the movie screen with memorable imagery, but when it gets down to the business of actually telling the story of Dune, this film adaptation is surprisingly lacking and uninspiring.  The story of Dune is a Machiavellian political thriller; a sadistic game of cat and mouse upsetting the power dynamics of civilizations on a cosmic scale.  Dune, the film, barely skims the surface of Frank Herbert's ocean of a narrative, and that makes this film hard to love for any Dune fan.  

All of this is not to say that Dune is not a film worth your time.  In fact, I would recommend everyone to go see this film on the largest screen possible.  It is an absolutely gorgeous film worthy of many awards for its technical achievements in production design, sound design, score, cinematography, the list goes on.  The film also commands several great performances, non so good as Rebecca Ferguson though, who lights up the screen as Lady Jessica, in what is this story's most compelling and nuanced character.  Ferguson is more than equal to the task here, though, and delivers what I believe to be one of the year's best performances.

Dune will likely satisfy general audiences more so than fans of the novel(s) and that is an achievement unto itself.  Dune is a difficult narrative to make palatable for the screen and for that the film deserves a lot of credit.

Before entering the theater, I knew to not expect a perfect movie. Frank Herbert's book is so jam packed with complicated language and characters, in a complicated political universe, all held together with a familiar world story of power, wealth, and a people living in a distinct caste system, that I am not sure anything but multiple films released over a decade or so could come close to covering the depth of the book and allowing the audience to understand the story's complexity every step of the way.

Every shot is a work of art - he's the master of clever sci fi. The cast is on point and boy what a cast! 
Timothee Chalamet is PERFECTLY cast as Paul. Every role almost seemed customly fit to each actor, yet Jason Momoa was the surprise heart of this film. 
lts no surprise that this does feel like half a movie - which I'm happy with, and glad they didn't rush the second half of the story like the original adaptation by David Lynch. I cannot wait for the sequel!

5.0,"“Dreams are messages from the deep.” The booming voice and words that open the film. Dune, an adaption of Frank Herbert’s sci-if epic, tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Most anybody who has been alive within the past 3-4 years has known Dune would be adapted theatrically within the coming years, and properly unlike David Lynch’s 1984 version. Denis Villeneuve was given the opportunity to direct and work with the writing team for this. As many of you know, he is in my top three favorite directors. For me, he’s made three perfect films (Arrival, Prisoners, and Blade Runner 2049). And now a fourth. He really did the impossible here by making a film that is too large for any screen, even IMAX. World building is a strength of his, and Dune is the perfect example of how he creates them. Unlike Star Wars or various planets in the MCU, these different settings and cultures do feel realistic. They may have been shot here on Earth, but simply watching it you never get that feeling. We’re set way in the future in a totally different galaxy. The production design team did wonders with this. In typical Villeneuve fashion, he makes things as large as possible. The sets (though some are done with visual effects) are ginormous. The visual effects are extremely good looking. For the budget they had, which wasn’t massive, they made some of the most realistic looking effects I’ve seen. There’s maybe a moment or two where it’s noticeable, but you can’t really tell. In every scene with something to that size, we always have a person or something smaller just to get the scale of it. Looking at it is entrancing. Aiding to that large scale look is the practically flawless cinematography. It’s eye-candy for us all. The way each planet has a different look helps set the mood perfectly. On Arrakis, and most of the film is set there, we have a desert planet that looks so terrifying and mystifying. During the day, the warm colors are brought out that even make you feel hot while watching. And at night, it becomes slightly muddy to give the feeling that we don’t know what’s out there. You’re on edge constantly. One of my favorite parts is actually this shot of Paul and Jessica running in this tunnel system and the only light is beams from above. As they’re running, those beams of light hit their shoulders and it’s framed and looks incredible. The fast paced editing that also takes it time works very well. This isn’t setup like a typical action film where you have one action scene concluding the first act, maybe one or two in the second, and a big battle with space portals in the third. They couldn’t even do it if they tried since this is only half of the novel. I mean, the novel is three books combined technically and we have two more to cover, so we’ve only seen a brief bit of it. That might make some people feeling empty towards the end, but the opening titles do say Dune: Part One. Even though it’s half, the runtime is 155 minutes and there’s plenty of everything where I don’t think you could leave feeling like you haven’t seen enough. I could lost the entire acting ensemble and how they all did, but that would take too long. All you need to know are the main leads. And before I do that, WE KNOW YOU’RE UPSET ZENDAYA IS IN IT FOR 7 MINUTES. Why is this such a problem? Yes they marketed her quite a bit, but she still has a lasting impact. Chani plays a huge role in the story and is a big motivation in this first half. Obviously, they were going to market Zendaya a lot because she’s had a great past few years, and also to get younger audiences to come see it since older audiences are going to be the ones who know this story more. I digress. Timothée Chalamet is perfectly cast as Paul. Some have said he shows hardly any emotion and never smiles in this which makes it hard to connect. Let me ask you this: What is there for Paul to be happy about? This is a hero’s journey epic so there’s more development to come (some of which couldn’t be talked about in just this first half to avoid creating another 15-30 minutes of explanation). I think his performance and how Paul is written is perfectly fine. Who I’m really excited to talk about is Rebecca Ferguson. Oh my god did she give it her all! Little did I know she would be the MVP of the film. This is easily her best performance to date and I don’t think I’m she could get any better. Jessica is a very complex character, but the way they built her relationship with Paul tells us every little detail about her. We know this most likely won’t happen, but with all the praise she’s getting for her performance, a supporting actress nomination would not be undeserved. As for Hans Zimmer’s score, well, there’s so much to talk about. Firstly, he turned down working with Christopher Nolan on Tenet for this. He always works with Nolan and that’s where his most iconic scores have come from. My favorite score of all time is Interstellar, and his work on Dune is so close to beating it out. I don’t think people realize how incredible it is. He literally created new instruments! It’s incredibly loud and large matching the scale of the film. We have the amazing vocalist Loire Cotler with the most intense and gritty voice belting out there. And what I love is how Zimmer paces the notes. Not to get too heavily in music theory, but they aren’t moving fast and aren’t constantly growing to get the huge sound. There’s also those juddering drums that never feel loud enough though they’re rattling your skull. The entire score feels epic, intense, and should move you to tears. He literally made three separate scores (The Dune Sketchbook, The Art and Soul of Dune, and the Motion Picture Score) for this. The total runtime to listen to all three is roughly 4:38hrs. I doubt you’ll have trouble finding something you don’t like. I’ve been listening to each album on repeat ever since seeing it last weekend (even the two tracks we were given back in August “Paul’s Dream” and “Ripples in the Sand”). Part of the sound design is just Zimmer’s score. Everything sound immaculate and part of the reason you should be seeing this in a theater and not just in the comfort of your living room. This film perplexed me to some level. I was hesitant to give it a perfect score, since that’s always a challenge for me. I let it sink in while it remained at the close stage. Once it saw it a third time (yes I saw it three times in one week), I think I knew my answer. There weren’t really any problems I had with it. The minor thing I could say is some of it can be confusing, then again, once you do your research or simply watch it a second time, you can find your answers. As someone who’s reading the novel, it is a hard read. It doesn’t really stop to answer your questions. If you don’t know a term, you look in the index in the back and learn it for yourself. The film explains everything well in my opinion. I was left with most of my questions answered that could be. Denis Villeneuve, who stated himself that this is his favorite film he’s made, was the only person to do this project. Each time it ended, and that long runtime flies by in an instant, I wanted to rewatch it again. Since I saw it three times (twice in a Dolby cinema and once in IMAX), I can confirm that I will have a hard time watching this on a normal sized tv. I’m looking for a big screen, but it’s also the sound that makes it a visceral experience (and why I preferred seeing it in a Dolby theater over IMAX). While it’s still in theaters, please please PLEASE see it! HBOMax is great for having film in theaters stream for free, but you cannot simply watch this and not wish you could’ve watched it in a theater. The box office for its first weekend didn’t make nearly enough as it should’ve or would have if it were only in theaters. Dune is a modern epic and now that part two has been greenlit, I could not be more excited. By far, the best thing I’ve seen all year. And now for its Oscar chances… Picture - yes Director - yes (hard category at the moment so maybe a win) S.

4.5,"Tough to miss the marketing buzz for this high-profile, big-budget lunge for the blockbuster mantle. And, what a surprise, this time it's actually worth all the promotion!

In Dune, the latest effort to convert Frank Herbert's intimidating and production-challenged novel to the big screen, creative heavyweight Denis Villeneuve has finally realized its potential. This is the rare case of a smart, lofty SF adaptation that remains fiercely loyal to the source material while also growing in more accessible, stimulating directions to appease a broader audience. Dare I say it... I think I might actually prefer this to the book? It's certainly more coherent than David Lynch's screwball 1984 adaptation.

Clearly, plenty of thought and care went into interpreting and adapting the first volume's dense, tangled themes for the cinema - Villeneuve has confessed to being a lifelong fan - and, as such, it requires a comparable amount of scrutiny and undivided attention for newer fans to parse. But where the novel elaborates upon its wealth of interests (a deep dive of far-flung politics, culture, economy and revolution) through long, dry monologues and descriptions, the film is more fluid and efficient. We don't have to be told when we can be shown, and that's a particular area of strength for a work with this much world-class production design to spread around. God, it's rife with visual wonders.

Even the expository bits, necessarily wordy by nature, are effectively managed to keep the viewer's head in the game. Everything doesn't have to be about talking heads, we learn, as Dune 2021 makes abundant use of subtitles to convey unspoken cues or nonverbal communication. That allows us to go far into the conceptual weeds without feeling verbose or static, a real godsend to a story that's so inherently brainy and long-winded. The ending is a mild letdown, a full hundred-fifty minutes of escalating stakes that culminates in a few meaningful glances and a ""see you in a few years,"" but the ride to get to that point is so well-balanced and riveting that I'm willing to let it slide.

5.0,"I think Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a great gift to cinema in general, there haven't been films like this in a long time.
To put it bluntly, this film is epic with an epic cast. 
The director outdid himself and impressed the audience in an incredible way: the drama, the emotions and the effects, he completed the sci-fi genre. 
This ambitious director, screenwriter and producer amazed me like few others. 
Villeneuve did not create a film where you have to follow the dialogues but rather one where you have to follow the images, he expresses himself and presents a film based on beautiful shots. 

When I came out of the cinema my thought was: OMG what have I seen! 
I felt excited and at the same time confused. 
Confused because the plot is not very clear, maybe because of the many characters and the fact that each of them has their own story, but in the end that is also why it is beautiful. 
There are two ways to understand it: read the book and pay attention when watching it. I say the same when I hear criticism about it or when I hear people thinking that there was absolutely a need for an opening scene to explain the setting of the film. 
In short, document yourselves! 

The events take place in the future in the year 10'191, most of the film, 
on a planet called Arrakis. It's interesting how people are ahead of technology, but society not. They are inside a feudal society, similar to medieval Europe, I think this because the feelings of human beings are the same, the kind of conflicts and the family is above everything. 
I also find this modernity-antiquity conflict interesting. 
The author of the book, Frank Herbert, was a bomb of imagination and a genius, and Denis Villeneuve the same. 

Now let's talk about the music, it must be said, the composer, Hans Zimmer amazed again, every time you heard his fantastic melody, you got goosebumps. Luckily, I had the chance to see it at the cinema, and thanks to that the emotions I felt were impressive and almost indescribable.
Music is POETRY, it's an important piece to complete the puzzle of the film and impressive. 
It's fascinating how music can make everything more complete, without it the film would have been completely different.

Now, the special effects, they are impressive and fantastic. 
They are so realistic that the audience feels like they are on Arrakis. And, speaking of Arrakis,
the poetry of the desert is well placed and takes its necessary part. 
I also find the colour palette appropriate, 
with tones ranging from grey-blue to yellow-orange, these colours are perfect to describe the surroundings, the buildings made by humans and the great expanse of desert that characterises the planet.  
When you are in the Harkonnen house the colours change to black-grey, so it is inevitable that the Harkonnen are associated with the colour black. 

Turning now to the acting which I think is excellent, at a high level, the kind of acting that makes the audience feel the emotions felt by the characters. 
Timothée Chalamet played Paul Atreides fantastically, making it clear that he is an admirable actor. 
Likewise Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto. 
Against that, I think Rebecca Ferguson's character could be less psychopathic and paranoid. 
In the book she's portrayed as thoughtful and cautious while in the film it's as if she's insane. At least that's my impression, maybe I played Lady Jessica differently than DV.
I also think Zendaya could have done more in this movie, the scenes where she talks are very few, she could have integrated more, against my argument though, it has to be said that this is only the first movie and another one is to come out. 

Finally, I think this film is not just for sci-fi fans but for anyone who likes to get to the end and not have everything clear in their mind. 
I recommend it to those who like art within a film and those who like beautiful cinematography and epic shots in general, instead I don't recommend it to those who like ""simple"" films.

5.0,"Hypnotic Work of Art

Denis Villeneuve's Dune is a unique triumph. It shatters the line between art house and popcorn movies, heaving it's huge budget for effects and stars like a feather. and somehow brings Frank Herbert's fantasy sci-fi to the screen in miraculous fashion.

You could see it coming. His Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 indicated the scale of his abilities but Dune delivers- he is the most talented fantasy director and storyteller alive. I read the novels long ago, and this film told the story well while opening up world building on an unprecedented scale (that will be fulfilled in part two of this enormous enterprise). Let's hope enough paying customers agree. It is slow, confusing and dark, just like the novels. I hope the audience who did not read the novels 50 years ago can make as much sense of this film as I did. There is some front end exposition, and some throughout which helps, but the space is there for you to ponder the meaning of what you are seeing.

As for the cast, Timothy Chalamet is perfect as Paul, the chosen one, and the supporting cast is as good as you can imagine. The effects are beyond expectation, including the marvellous Bene Gesserit voice effects. The Hans Zimmer score occasionally overpowers, but it contributes to the overall sense of wonder. Oh yeah, the sand worms are there - and they will no doubt star in part 2.

The menacing of the Baron, Rabban and DeVires were amazing!  And too long with too many scene as people charging each other like little ants on the giant battle field canvas.  I am probably not the target audience, but I could easily sat through another 3hrs if the rest of the time was more about those fascinating characters and themes of power and control and meaning and manipulations....

4.0,"I haven't seen Dune show, neither have I seen any previous animated or live-action Dune adaptation. It was my first time experiencing, this story - a Dune newbie if you will. I am going to have to judge this film accordingly. I had heard that understanding this story has a lot of pre-requisites like many families, side-armies, an emperor and so on. I'll say this version (Dune 2021) movies very quick with that and just throws a bunch of information at you and expect you to understand it. For that I will have to admit, the film comes a lot heavy-handed in the first half when you're figuring out who's who. That's first of two gripes with the film. The second thing I was not particularly a fan of is the ending. Though we know a now-greenlit sequel is coming, the ending does not feel coherent and satisfying with everything that we saw before. Everything else - directing, acting, cinematography, set design, costume design, visual effects and soundtrack are fantastic. It feels like the people involved in the project really put their soul into making it. I saw a video in which director Denis Villeneuve read this book when he was a kid and it stuck with it. Every shot in this film oozes with love and passion. My only regret was I got to see it on the small screen and not experience it on the cinema.

I will even go as far as stating how impressed I am of the newer adaptation being an improvement over the 1984 version. The film definitely sets up its world in a way that will have you immersed into it. From the compositions and blocking to the color palettes to the set design to the musical score, the movie overshadows a lot of its downsides in a way that the visuals speak for themselves rather than actual lines. The movie's pacing at times can be a bit slow, but at least it utilizes its time building a world that you can come to be infatuated with. The movie is very straightforward in its plot, so characters may at times have some emotions, but then at other moments, they do not.

3.5,"1984 Dune main theme was burned into my head the first time I heard it.  I will never forget it.  In the end, all this movie had was a lot of fancy sound effects gently coersed into music.  Is any music from this movie stuck in your head?  No music in this version came anywhere close to the scene in 1984 version where the thumper seamlessly bleeds into the main theme.

To be fair, the sound effect music overall was fantastic.  But there is no powerful memorable linchpin.  It's just music/sound effects that could fit in many movies...  The only reason I even posted this review is because I read some bull about the composer thinking about the score for 50 years and not watching 1984 version because he didn't want to ruin the dune music in his head... load of artistic bs.

As for the movie, very ambivalent.  Some parts are amazing, others kinda suck.  Very little inbetween.  So much time to fill, but left unfilled of details it could have had for the sake of being drawn out slowly and overdramatically.  As far as modern movies go (they mostly suck) this one is great - on par with 1984 version.

And to add onto that, it boasts a stellar cast and some of the most amazing visuals I've seen since Lord of the Rings.

5.0,"Having not read the book(full disclosure), I will still say that this movie was a great film and definitely one of the best sci fi movies I've seen in a very long time. You could tell that it was adapted from a novel by the way that it explored character growth and relationships more than the average space movie. Another aspect that I appreciated, was the subdued use of action and fighting throughout. Most sci fi movies often rely on action and long fight sequences to make their movie stand out. But Dune explored other areas that made it such a unique and fun film to watch, all while not sacrificing the awesome scale of action sequences when they were required. Moviegoers can get their fix of intense and beautifully choreographed fight scenes while also experiencing a deeper level of cinema. The director also does a great job of not overcomplicating the story. Sure there are pieces of the book that I am sure we have lost, but it's a movie and not everything can fit. Backstory and Lore are easily summed up for the viewer, especially with how much there is to see in the galaxy of dune. 10/10 film.

4.0,"Denis Villeneuve creates another banger. This isn't my favorite of his films but it's still fantastic. My main issue with it though is that it is on the slower side and there is an emphasis on set up here but with the knowledge that it's set up similarly to the Lord of the Rings films then it wasn't something I took a major issue with. Even if it's a lot of set up, it's an engaging and investing set up. Besides a couple of scenes, I was fully engaged with the story and characters throughout. On a pure technical level, this film is masterful. The visual effects are off the charts. All of the ships, locations, and animals feel incredibly realistic and whimsical. The cinematography is fantastic. I prefer the cinematography in Blade Runner 2049 but it was still amazing here. Every shot looks incredible with how it's lit or the framing. The performances were pretty great. I wouldn't say this is the best performance from these actors with the exception of Jason Mamoa and Rebecca Ferguson. Both of them do a great job and I'm excited to see what else they can do. Hans Zimmer once again puts out another banger score. This is easily the better between this and No Time To Die but both are still great. The character work definitely helps the set up feel engaging. We don't get a lot of exposition dumps about our characters but we are shown how they act and it's great. I wouldn't put this at the top of a Villeneuve ranking but it's up there and I can't wait for the sequel. Definitely check this film out when you can.

3.5,"DUNE must be experienced on the largest screen possible.
The DUNE novels never made it into my hands, so I might not be the target audience for this film. I did try to enjoy the 1984 movie directed by David Lynch, but I couldn't finish it. But I do like big Sci-fi films, which is what this movie is. So if you plan to watch DUNE filmed with IMAX cameras, I recommend finding the most giant screen your theater has to offer.

DUNE is long and slow sitting at 2 hours and 35 minutes. For movie lovers and DUNE fans the long runtime and drawn out story will not be a problem. For the rest of you, be ready to look at your watch for time to time. I enjoyed the cinematic shots from beginning to end but knowing this movie is a drawn out PART 1 of a planned multi-movie franchise made it difficult to appreciate this movie for what is is, an intelligent, eerie and gorgeous sci-fi epic.

Surprisingly DUNE is not director Denis Villeneuve's best film.

His more notable movies are better than DUNE, such as 2015's Sicario and 2017's Blade Runner 2049. Despite that, Villeneuve is an excellent filmmaker and has a great eye for this genre. All the visuals were top tier, and the special effects were seamless, which will easily immerse moviegoers into the world of Dune.

The cast is brilliant, which features Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Zendaya. After DUNE's debut, Chalamet, who has already signed on to play Willy Wonka in the upcoming origins movie, will be offered plenty of prominent roles. Unfortunately, this movie is not filled with that much dialogue, and at times this whispery dialogue is incoherent. But the cast does give stellar performances with what they are handed with. Also, seeing Oscar Isaac in his role as Leto Atreides has me super excited for his Metal Gear Solid movie.

A light show without much depth. Flat and tasteless. I have no feeling for the characters, and despite the long runtime the story feels rushed. They've removed any mystery. It's not foreshadowing, it's telling you exactly what's going to happen, which leaves no room for mystery, curiosity, nor surprise.

I love Dune by Frank Herbert.
I love the Dune 1984 2Hr & 4Hr versions, despite the divergence from the novels.
I really liked the Dune TV Mini-Series from 2000, that I feel was the most accurate on screen portrayal of Dune to date.
I have been a Dune fanboy for over 25 years.

This on screen adaptation is being made as two or more movies, with the first one being just over two and a half hours long (a decently long movie) and yet feels very rushed. They over-explain things that are left to be mysterious in the book and other movies, and under explain a lot of the things I feel are fun and interesting from the book and other movies.

The visual effects are very good, but what I'd expect with modern CGI technology.

I feel like this is a Dune made for people who enjoy the Transformer movies more than people who enjoy -Dune-.

5.0,"This was exactly the experience I was looking for while returning to a movie theater, visually stunning, griping, dark, meaningful accompanied by a daunting soundtrack, there's nothing more to ask from a Sci-Fi movie.

Based on the 1965 novel with the same name, the passion of the director Dennis for this story, is clearly felt on the screen, the set design, production design and overall cinematography is breath taking, this associated with the masterful soundtrack and sound effects - brings to life this stunning world that is a complete fantasy yet it feels somehow very real.
The ensemble that was put together seems to fit each role perfectly, Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson as co-leads of the story are impeccable, but every other secondary character feels no less important and its role on this massive plot seems organic and connected to the overall story.

Given the limited time a movie can have, I don't feel at all that this was a rushed experience, you might not be able to explore all the dimensions of the entire list of characters, and sure enough some elements of the plot might fetch that old and familiar over explored concept of good vs evil, however contrary to most science fiction blockbusters (including the one that ""took inspiration"" from Dune), you do grasp that grey area or three dimensional field that audiences crave so much (and rightfully so) these days.
This is just the first part, but you can clearly see individuals with some internal struggles, and for a lot of them there will be room for character development in the upcoming sequel(s) and some hints were dropped that not everything is what it seems.

I felt dawned to the story the entire time, it's the way it's directed and the creative world that was put together that has this magnetism, and of course it goes without saying that the parallels with the real world (even today almost 60 years after the original story) are as scary as they are accurate - this is the other major factor that a Sci-Fi strives on, being a metaphor for our real life experiences and Dune has done this beautifully.
Even the way all the cultures and different world inhabitants were portrayed, with what seems to have been a multi cultural inspiration not only in the locations, but also the music and the actors, brilliant all around.",Clapper P,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 31, 2021",Clapper P,/user/id/10b4b75c-d8f4-4c93-b40e-24e78388893a,RT,10b4b75c-d8f4-4c93-b40e-24e78388893a,

4.5,"Finally, a space epic that actually feels epic! It's got a Lord-of-the-Rings-in-space vibe, but a little darker and with less direction. The set pieces are awesome; even though we don't get to spend a lot of time off Arrakis, every planet feels like it has its own unique climate, ecosystem, and culture. It's also got really good effects, to the point where I couldn't tell when they're CGI and when they're practical. Massive objects really feel massive and the storms and caverns of Arrakis are terrifying while feeling natural. The unique score really feels menacing and alien, adding some ominous tones and mystery.

Now, there's something you need to know going into this movie, which I wish I had known - it's only part one of at least one more movie. Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler; it's got ""Part One"" in the opening credits. My expectations were off given the marketing of this movie, which never mentioned that this was only the first installment. For one thing, the movie feels a little directionless at times, although it's hard to judge until the series is finished. Also, Zendaya is barely in this movie at all.

Timothee Chalamet is really good - he portrays a reckless young adult reluctant to the family's royalty while also playing on Chosen-One tropes. The rest of the cast is honestly great as well, although Jason Mamoa sometimes feels like he's just having fun more than actually participating in the movie.

It doesn't beg for comparisons to the 1984 original, thankfully, but if one were to compare (such as I am doing) it would be no contest that 2021's is miles ahead. I was particularly impressed with how well it teaches information on intricate plots effectively and without feeling forced.

I'm glad the movie didn't stray far from the source material, but like Lynch's film before it this new Dune movie also fails to understand the real protagonist should be the planet itself, and ended up feeling mostly like a shoddily connected highlight reel, missing all of the emotion from the books, rather than a true rendition of what I read in those pages all this time ago.

4.5,"If you haven't read Frank Herbert's 1965 cult novel or know about David Lynch's messy movie adaptation in 1984, you might wonder what's the fuss about when watching Denis Villeneuve's 2021 version which makes it look so simple and effortless. Much of that is down to an elegant and coherent screenplay which manages to update and streamline the sometimes antiquated and immensely dense plot of the source material into something more palatable and uncluttered. Set in a futuristic-feudal world where a Machiavellian plot against the noble House of Atreides plays out on the brutally arid planet of Arrakis where a valuable substance nicknamed 'Spice' is mined, this sci-fi soap opera can feel familiar but that's only because it has been borrowed by so many others since then. Villeneuve's film defines the word spectacle with its majestic and sweeping cinematography, wisely shot on location, and awe-inspiring special effects which allow Herbert's imagination to come alive on screen. Hans Zimmer's Arabian-tinged score which creates an immersive other-worldly aural experience and the film's stunning production and costume designs further invoke and accentuate the Islamic culture and the Middle Eastern allegory that permeate throughout Herbert's book. Amongst a huge ensemble of mostly MCU/DC movies alumnus led by Timothee Chalamet, it's Rebecca Ferguson's and Oscar Issac's layered performances as the Duke and his concubine that stand out most for me. Astutely splitting the novel into two films, this first part has a lot of world-building and exposition to get through, the fact that Villeneuve manages to do that with such grace and style, all the while keeping its pacing tight and its momentum going so well that the film's 2h35m duration literally flew by, demonstrate unequivocally what an astounding achievement this is.

What weakness there are really stem from the source material.  It feels like a prelude to much larger story, which is what it is. That becomes a challenge in a two part film.  It is one episode told over two films that is itself a a jumping off point to even larger mythology.  You are welded mostly to Pauls POV and thus intriguing threads and side characters are not explored beyond what is minimally needed to advance the plot.  It is the.age old challenge of focusing on plot vs.character development. You could adapt this as a ten hour series and lose no details, but you would sacrifice the grandeur and scale of a theatrical release that delivers maximum impact.

They should have just used Grimes' 'Geidi Primes' album, would have worked much better and most of the work would already be done.  The usage of the 'the voice' was done in an excessively intense audio distortion. 

  I'm a big fan of the books and even Lynch's film.... So I had high hopes for this, especially when I heard they were going to put it in 2 parts.  I figured that meant they weren't going to skimp on painting Frank Herbert's brilliant vision... But they did. Baron Harkonnen lacks all of his dialogue that paints the picture of a cold yet wise and calculating villiain with a different view of the world from the protagonist.  They completely left out Feyd Rautha - the heir to the throne who is supposed to be the one Paul (the protagonist) fights in a duel to the death in the end of the book. 
They did such a poor job of illustrating who the enemy is that they just come off as generic spooky evil people. 

The acting was good enough. Although Lady Jessica is supposed to be enrapturingly beautiful and Rebecca Ferguson is not ugly by any means, but not really Jessica material... The fight scenes were choreographed well.  

The movie ending is pretty terrible. ((No real spoilers here))  It's very abrupt and is quite the anti-climax... Not to mention all the Fremen walking on the surface during the day without their stillsuit masks on.  Fremen heavily look down on people with poor water discipline.

I'm not into slow movies, so that part wasn't my cup of tea, but the reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because even though the movie was slow, the graphics were amazing, and my boyfriend (who had read the dune book and an adorkable nerd) absolutely loved it.

He told me that it really went off of the books, and they did a really amazing job on the movie. I've never read the books so I'm going to trust him on this one.

In fact the woman who had the seat next to had her friend that was sitting behind her, come forward about half way tell her she doesn't understand this at all and wanted to leave, they both left. I have never seen anyone leave a theater before. The actors in the 1984 had presence and you understood who they were and why the were there, part of that was the narration and part of it was in movie explanation. These actors except for the Baron and the Beast really lacked any presence, the actress who was Jessica seemed so weak while the mother superior was interviewing Paul I absolutely did not believe that she could stop anyone from coming into save him from the box.

1.5,"Disappointing. Doesnt compare to Book or Lynch film. Gray film with pallid actors.  It was filmed partly in  Liwa Oasis, which I've visted, and partly in Jordan. In Liwa, the UAE, Oman, and Egypts western dsert where I've spent a total of 8 weeks., where the sky was bright blue., During the four years when I taught Arabic speaking students in the desert country of Qatar, the sky was blue 95% of the time, except during the rare sandstorm or dustorm.. IN this film the sky is always hazy and the light dim and gray.. The first Fremen to visit Duke Atriedes walks in disrespectfully and is terse and rude. Generally espec. in formal occasions, Arabic-speaking people are restrained, polite, and courteous. The Fremen here act like some mongrel gang in NYC, L.A., or any early Star Trek episode, not the self-possesed people of the book. IN the Lynch film, Baron Harkonnen is dramatically evil and  grotesque, as he pulls the plug from the chest to make his catamite die, and his son is also recognizable dreadful. The continually stoned navigator in his bubble is also striking and very alien and shows the reason for spice, and also tells us we're in a verry different world. No navigator here. Sting is striking and unfortunately has given the world a new style of unnecessary emphasis with his ""I WILL kill him"" even though nobody said otherwise. IN the 2021 version. the Harkonnen son is like some bit-part brain-damaged thug and the floating baron has little personality. The Lynch film is reputed to be too hard to follow for its complex plot Well, not here. Far too much time is taken up in crowd shots of unrecognizable people kniving and hitting each other, by the dragonfly shaped helicopter flying up and down and sideways in gray-brown sand, and by enormous metal boxes landing or taken off in yet more dust with a few flames thrown in. Gurney Halek and Duncan have little personality, mostly expressed in the kinds of male hugs seen far more often in movies rarely seen in real lfe. I dont care when they get killed because I dont care. Action sequences are just there to have action sequences. Paul gets in a knife fight with a thuggish Fremen, the yg fmale Fremen, sneers at him, Paul wins, and suddenly he's a Fremen and one of the gang..  Paul absorbs the Fremen ""philosophy"" as he hears phrases that are variations on ""go with the flow"" and other pop psychology phrases that Frank Herbert wouldnt have let him self put on paper. The actor playing the mother Jessica seemed colourless and pallid, her complexion not helped by the grim lighting. The best parts were retained from the book. The ""command voices"" were well done. The hunter seeked at least appeared, although its menace was underdone, and it's good they retained the poison tooth sequence and those involving the doctor. Overall, little wonder the theatre where I saw it was mostly empty.

4.5,"Dune (part 1)  (2021) currently in Theaters and on HBO MAX.  It is yet another attempt to capture Frank Herbert's epic tale of spice, messiahs, and treachery on the screen.  It a massive improvement on David Lynch's 1984 effort and obviously vastly better than the TV miniseries from 2001, but it is only a little more than half the book (with about twenty minutes at the start from prequel novels and just ""explanation"" of some of the background and characters.)  Its worth a trip to the theaters if you have any interest in it, but it will be hard to judge the film until the 2nd half is made.  As it is ...its a 4 star movie with the chance of being 4 ½ if the 2nd part lands with the same impact.   My two biggest beefs are Timothée Chalamet (who I have never found appealing acting wisé...he seems like an angry stonier in every film but that works for this film) and the weird portrayals of the villains who are supposed to be smart and crafty ...but always seem more brutal buffoons (in fairness to the movie that is also true in the book).  I am given the film a pass on failing to explain many of the weirdness that does have explanations ...the swords, mentats, folding space, the loss of most of the ""time"" on dune by our main charactrs...as it manages to work without fully revealing all of them (and at 2 and half hours it had to make some cuts).

However, they are on Arakis only a short time before the Harkonnen attack, not enough time to fall behind. 

House Harkonnen seems upset that control of Arakis was taken away from them, but they were in on the plot with the emperor and knew why he took this action!  This is why they were able to enlist imperial troops in the assault. 

I can overlook minor plot holes, like how creatures miles long can survive and maintain their size with so little available food, or why security was so lax when Duke Leto expected an attack. Also, why does the family physician have access to the security codes?

Guns in future sci-fi? NO! 
Bagpipes in future sci-fi? YES!

Previously only knowing the source material from a far distance, as one of the holy texts of a cult of science fiction geeks that could rattle off every detail at will and had strong opinions on every facet of it, my only thought going into this film was ""sand worms, but Denis Villeneuve"". For a book that is notorious not only for its depth but its focus on conveyng details through internal dialogue, any adaptation was going to be a struggle between entertainment value, length, and faithfulness to Herbert's vision; the original 1984 Lynch adaptation found mixed success apparently in large part because it focused too heavily on exposition, but here the script sticks to a healthy medium. Yes, it's a long film and only conveys half of the 'full' story of the first book, but it captures the audience's attention with its worldbuilding and scope to the point that even diehard fans seem to have come to accept its slight changes and omissions. 

Hans Zimmer needs to calm the fuck down. I know he's attempting to convey the sweeping nature of the narrative, and sought deliberately to deviate from his prior style by seeking inspiration from new instruments and desert environments, but some of the chant-yelling forces you to cover your ears in an IMAX theatre. When he's working with Christopher Nolan, he can fall back on the director's unorthodox choices for sound mixing, but with the more restrained Villeneuve there's less of an excuse; the musical themes do work well with the material, but my ears are still ringing. 

Visually, Dune is a stunner. Tremendous sense of scale, great landscapes, interesting costumes; it all heightens the sense of mystery and the lack of complete explanations and backstory for each faction that is introduced; the sense of the unknown is conveyed very well and leaves you wanting more. Good performances all around, even if Momoa is just doing the Bro-moa character and Dastmalchian is still fixed in my memory as Polka-Dot Man. Yes, the ensemble cast is too substantial to each get their due depth (Skarsgård's Baron Harkonnen in particular is essentialy just a series of careful double-crosses rolled up into a fatsuit), but the runtime was long enough as is.

Overall, great approach to the material. It's tough to judge a film accurately that was built from the ground-up to cover only part of a narrative, but this has the potential to be one of the great space operas.

I mean we have a whole spices section at the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul just visit it and be done with it. 2) the movie was so dark I've actually seen only 40% of it and its hard to see the faces/emotions of the characters if not understanding who it is. 3) during the launch of the movie you see Zendaia all over the red carpet which is quite interesting mainly cause she has 15 min playtime. And as last 4)If you are not a fan boy/girl of the books than just dont go, you will walk away just like me asking for the lost 2,5 hours of you life back and naming this movie the worst thing you've ever seen in your life and i mean not only the worst movie but actually the worst thing you've seen EVER",Esranur K,False,False,False,False,0.5,"Oct 29, 2021",Esranur K,/user/id/979312398,RT,979312398,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10226868235960228/picture
1.5,"Super disappointed by this as I'm a huge Villeneuve fan. Granted, I had never read the book, but found the film to be overly dull, pretentious, and bleak. The movie didn't have a single character to connect with. I wanted to like this so much. I realize this is Part 1 of a 2 part story, but a film should be able to stand on its own (i.e. Star Wars A New Hope which world builds and is a stand alone story without needing Empire). and yes of course it's ironic that Star Wars was heavily influenced by Dune the novel. I found this a slog to get through and was checking my watch countless times to see how much was left. I saw it in IMAX and although the scope, score, visuals and presentation was outstanding, an entertaining 'experience' does not equal a good 'movie'.",Movie M,False,False,False,False,1.5,"Oct 29, 2021",Movie M,/user/id/979040483,RT,979040483,

5.0,"If there is any other director aside from Christopher Nolan who has had the consistency that he has in his career as a filmmaker, it would be Denis Villeneuve. The man is simply a genius when it comes to the art of cinema and was the perfect choice to bring Dune back to the big screen. The latter title is based off a 1965 novel of the same name, which is widely known as the most influential sci-fi novel of all time. What I just described is about all I knew going into the film. Upon doing some more research I saw that George Lucas was heavily influenced by the novel when he was writing Star Wars. I have not seen the first incarnation of Dune on the big screen which I've heard mixed things about, but having heard all the buzz surrounding it, I was naturally excited. The trailers looked awesome, the ensemble cast is enough to draw anyone into cinemas to see it, and of course the crew behind the movie had someone like me expecting a masterpiece. Having seen it, that's exactly what I got. Dune is quite simply a fantastic piece of cinema that had me hooked from the very first scene all the way to when the credits started rolling. It's a game changer for sci-fi and was a theater experience I won't forget anytime soon.

From what I gather, Dune is like Star Wars, if it wasn't as popular as it is. So much lore, so much backstory, that a lot of people didn't think a film like this would be possible because it would be hard to get audiences hooked. To give a short plot synopsis, this is the story of Paul Atreides, the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital substance in the galaxy. Paul and his family, the noble House Atreides, are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet Arrakis where the substance lies on. This film stars an ensemble cast featuring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and the brilliant Javier Bardem. That's…pretty much the entire cast but I felt it was appropriate to name them all so you understand the sheer scope of talent surrounding this movie. It's well known that actors read a film's script before deicding to or not to sign onto the project. If all of these A list actors were in on it, that should tell you something on top of the man who's directing the flick. Oh, and Hans Zimmer is behind the film's score. Honestly, if you're me and you read all of that, you don't even need to see the movie to know that it's going to be great. The directing in this film is nothing short of masterful. I've watched movies with some very impressive visuals in my time, and this movie is sitting far atop the list of best looking films I've ever seen. The visuals have a depth to them that not many films have. Even the brilliance on display in the 3rd act of Endgame don't matchup to the sheer scope of this film. Cinematographer Greig Fraser who worked on Rogue One was the director of photography for this film as well. Having now seen both movies, I can definitely see how this man had worked on Rogue One. Especially during the 3rd act battle of that film, he made those AT-AT walkers feel massive and of course capturing the size of the Death Star in certain shots made it feel like a real machine. You can just tell how passionate WB was about letting this team create this world and give it a visceral feel. Shots featuring these giant sandworms were some of the best and most detailed I've seen a creature or sequence featuring one in a long time. I have to tip my hats off to the visual effects team because they all really outdid themselves with this film. It really feels like a world that exists somewhere and that's the highest praise a VFX team can get so again, cheers to them.

Circling back to how big the Dune lore is and how many feared that it would be difficult to tell a story like this without just dumping loads of exposition, I think they did a fantastic job all things considered. The amount of lore and information the viewer has to understand to follow along with the story is massive. This script does everything it needs to do without it feeling like they're holding our hands the whole time. For instance, this certain ability that some people can do that's called ""The Voice"" which allows them to influence other people's actions is portrayed early on to us. It's given a scene where there's a brief explanation of what it is, then it's all presented through visual storytelling. In the first scene with it, we immediately understand its power through the films use of show don't tell. It shows you that Denis Villeneuve and his writers have a high amount of respect for their audiences. Everything in this universe has to be communicated to the audience in a way that feels organic without an overload of exposition or backstory. That can be a difficult task when the source material has so much information and depth already. But again, they did a great job communicating the key elements of the information that is most important for us the audience to grasp this story. The long history of politics between civilizations who are fighting both physically and in ways like signing documents and whatnot. It's all presented very well and I wasn't confused in the slightest over what was going on.

All of the acting in the movie was terrific especially from Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac. Their family dynamic and monologue scenes between them all were great. Something I'm sure some members might not like is the fact that Zendaya is not in the movie much. She's more of a dream, or apparition for Chalamet's character and doesn't show up until the end. What I did not know, but at the same time had a feeling for, was that this is the first part of the story. The film is marketed as its own thing but when the title card flashes, it says Dune Part One. Though this movie stands as a film, there is an incomplete feeling to it which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there's time to soak in the fact that there's more to tell. Unlike Halloween Kills which just…ended, and now we have to wait until the next one, Dune felt much more like a movie that told what it needed to and will carry on to a hopeful sequel. Before writing this review, I had no idea if a sequel would even happen because this movie was relying heavily on its box office numbers. Thankfully on 10/26/21, the sequel was officially greenlit and announced by WB and is set for release in October 2023. So this makes me feel more at peace with the films ending that we will get a continuation of this story. I hope everyone returns for the sequel, especially Villeneuve and Hanz Zimmer. Speaking of, his music was absolutely incredible as it always is. What was so majestic about this score in particular is it sounds like music Hans Zimmer would write but it also sounds like something very reminiscent to something he would write. Weird analogy, but it shows you how versatile the man is when it comes to composing music.

I absolutely loved this film. It's one of the best movies of the year and continues to solidify October 2021 as one of the best October's there's been in cinema. No Time To Die, The Last Duel, and now Dune. It's been a fabulous month for movies and I could not be happier with how this film turned out. Please do not watch this movie on HBO Max. This was made for the movie theater. Go see it in IMAX or Dolby while it's still on those screens. If it's not on those anymore, you owe it to yourself to experience where it was made to be seen. Here's a quote from Denis Villeneuve himself back when it was announced with HBO Max streaming WB movies simultaneously. He blasted WB by saying,

""Dune is by far the best movie I've ever made. My team and I devoted more than three years of our lives to make it a unique big screen experience. Our movie's image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters. I'm speaking on my own behalf, though I stand in solidarity with the sixteen other filmmakers who now face the same fate. Please know I am with you and that together we are strong. The artists are the ones who create movies and series. I strongly believe the future of cinema will be on the big screen, no matter what any Wall Street dilettante says. Since the dawn of time, humans have deeply needed communal storytelling experiences. Cinema on the big screen is more than a business, it is an art form that brings people together, celebrating humanity, enhancing our empathy for one another — it's one of the very last artistic, in-person collective experiences we share as human beings. Once the pandemic is over, theaters will be filled again with film lovers. That is my strong belief. Not because the movie industry needs it, but because we humans need cinema, as a collective experience. So, just as I have both a fiduciary and creative responsibility to fulfill as the filmmaker, I call on AT&T to act swiftly with the same responsibility, respect and regard to protect this vital cultural medium. Economic impact to stakeholders is only one aspect of corporate social responsibility. Finding ways to enhance culture is another. The movie going experience is like no other. In those darkened theaters films capture our history, educate us, fuel our imagination and lift and inspire our collective spirit. It is our legacy. Long live theatrical cinema!""

4.5,"This is probably the first work I see being adapted for the screen, with such ambition and determination, although the result is not always what was expected. 

Dune by Dennis Villeneuve is a very interesting and striking adaptation of the work of Frank Herbert. It presents a beautiful cinematography, with various visual spectacles, while it sometimes lacks a more in-depth script that connects us with the main characters. There are scenes that I would have liked to see being passed from the book to the screen, but unfortunately they didn't make it to the final cut. The end of the film is a little anti-climactic, but the relationship between story and time available is understandable.

It is a slower movie, as its over two and a half hours long, but the movie has a good pace for the amount of information that is given to the audience. Timothe Chalamet is a really strong leading man in this movie, and the rest of the cast is great too.

Long Review:  Choice of actors was good, atmosphere was good, soundtrack was bad.  This 2021 version of Dune (part 1) was obviously designed to put a person to sleep.  For what reason would a person give this film a second viewing?  One of the most memorable characters of the David Lynch 1984 version of Dune was the villain Baron Harkonnen, but in this film the Baron is a complete bore.  Sure some may criticize the 1984 Baron as a comic-book villain, but he absolutely could not be used as a sleep-aid.

1.0,"I'm truly shocked by the number of people who actually like this garbage. It's an almost 3 hour movie that doesn't even have a satisfying ending but a cliffhanger so it could end in a second movie. To me that's the laziest way to end a movie. To end a movie and if you want to make a sequel make it ambiguous and so the audience that say oh what's next but also think dang that's it. And make them believe that's the end but then secretly have a sequel that. The pacing was very slow and I legit wanted to fall asleep due to it's long long runtime. I've never seen the original 1980 something dune but now I want to, to see if it's somewhat better than this garbage. The acting is very bland and not really anything. It's just monotone nonsense. I get that this movie was attempting to be the next big franchise but in my eyes this is not it. But I am surprised by how many people actually enjoy this movie. Maybe because of this whole lockdown thing people have no taste. I don't know but I have no clue how people could last 3 hours in a theater. I'm so glad this was on HBO max and I could barely make it through the first hour and 45 minutes. After that I had to take a break aka 2 hours to then have the patience to sit through the rest. In the end this movie could've been something with better acting, better writing and that's it. This movie looks like a huge spectacle. I bet Warner brothers spent a lot of money on this and it shows. The only compliment I could give this movie is it looks fantastic. But unfortunately this movie doesn't amount to anything and will be in the $5 bin at Walmart either this Black Friday or the next year after that. If they ever make a dune part 2 I'll possibly scream but not in joy but rather in anger. A little joke at the end. Anyway hopefully another movie never happens but maybe it could.

5.0,"Overall, a different take and perspective on the Dune Book. Very little scenes and lines copied over from first movie which, if you are a fan, will undoubtedly you will compare with. However the major events are still there. I prefer this Harkonnen. as a better representation of the persona in the book. Lady Jessica does cry a bit more than you would expect from the BG Guild. Love the designs of the vehicles - especially the ornithopters (need to get one)  and the other sets. Also, some of the background on the Atreides House.

5.0,"I am only giving this 5 stars, so to promote something that different going against marvel monopoly in the movie market. However this is film is actually a 3/5 for me. Mainly because of the slow pacing, lack emotional character development, ""soulless"" spice addition, and poor story choices.

Poor choices are made and changed in this movie because the writers and director did not read and understand all the Dune books (perhaps the producers as well)

1. There was civil war with A.I./robots before Dune story starts. All the machines like ships are run by 2 race of sub human creatures.. the mentats and the navigator. It appear that regular humans (they ""could"" be mentats) were driving ships in this movie. On top of that, there was 1 scene of ""autopilot"" being turned on which makes ZERO sense in the Dune world because there is a Technophobia feeling that are missing in this movie because prequel robot civil war (only navigators and mentats can use machines/ships). The religious theme is shown here in the background, but religious dialogue and symbols (such as the cross) are cut back as well. The spice is like an drug/power addiction and there no mention of this in the movie. You have zero sense that people are getting emotional of the spice addiction like alcoholic going through withdrawal or emotional/physical abuse.

2. The ""woke"" culture has been applied to most of the Fremen. I think all or most of them are ""black"" and ""brown"" people (there is at least 1 gender swap here as well from the book). Which I have no problem here about this. However I am making assumption here is creators of this Dune movie thought that the Fremen are the ""heroes"" of Dune.... and that what it may seem in the 1st Dune book... but.... **spoiler alert** in the future books the Fremen group become the fascist, evil, and a dictatorship in supporting God Emperor through the ""Golden Path""... destroying every other group in the universe.... So... whoever thought this was a ""good idea"" to promote this was likely by accident. In which they are painting the possible future where the ""black"" and ""brown"" people are essentially evil.

3. There is no ""classic"", ""fun"", ""cheesy"", or ""extreme"" moments like in cult favorite 1984 movie. There no fun cheesy lines to have fun with. it's like taking out all fun lines out of the original Star War, James Bond, or Indian Jones... There is no ""meme"" to have here. This feels like a generic action cgi remake/reboot movie just like Robocop, Total Recall, Ghostbusters, or the Mummy.

We got so many so called  ""positive"" reviewers located here in Rotten Tomatoes but I think most of those reviewers have not seen the good old scf-fi movies or read the Dune books. There is so many bad sci-fi movies in our last generation that alot of people have now forgotten all good sci-fi movies from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, etc. Some other people here are only liking this movie because of the woke-ness it has in the background of the story. Some people here only gave positive reviews here because they are sick of the superhero genre.  The only issues I have with 1984 movie are some effects are out of date and there ""slight"" changes to movies. The changes in this 2021 are way larger and more tone deaf to the book than 1984 version. To me the definitive version of Dune will be 1984 one (even if it was not ""perfect"").",Andrew S,False,False,True,True,5.0,"Oct 28, 2021",Andrew S,/user/id/978213051,RT,978213051,

3.0,"Not sure what all the hype is about. Visually, the movie is stunning. Throughout the movie, you really feel a sense of scale of the world around the characters. I think some of the scenery shots did linger a bit too long, but that's not a big deal. The score by Hans Zimmer is also very well done. Once they finally got to some action, it was well done. Casting was all-around solid and I had no gripes with the acting.

Now for what I didn't like. This movie is so boring. I hardly ever start dozing off on the first watch of a movie (looking at you Jurassic World 2 & Fantastic Beasts 2), but I did during this movie. Hardly anything happens in the first hour and a half of this movie. Yet, with all that exposition, I still didn't understand everything as well as I felt I should have. Reasons for rivalries and betrayals weren't explained very well and often, when something was finally being explained, the characters were speaking so quietly I missed half the conversation. It's quite obvious that this is just setup for part 2. I know that's the point, but a movie should be entertaining enough to stand on its own.

I'm not saying not to watch the movie, but I certainly won't be re-watching this and I doubt I'll watch the sequel. If this has happened to sway you off of watching Dune, I'm sorry.

0.5,"I'll preface this with the fact I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure how true to the original material this movie is. I'll also say I absolutely love Sci-Fi and went into this wanting to love it.
The first movie I almost walked out of. Most of the movie was slow motion dreams of Zendaya which kept popping up at really annoying times. One or two time, yeah sure it shows he's having visions of his future, but every 10 minutes it happened again, adding nothing new to the plot or taking the story anywhere. 
None of the Sci-Fi elements even slightly make sense; useless shields that seem to have just been there to make it very obvious that someone took a killing blow. Ship designs that made no sense if the laws of physics are to be trusted (if any movie / show deviates from this, a throw away line stating this is all thats needed, this had no such line). Doctors that at no explanation can see whats wrong with you from just touching you. A character being healed in what we can only assume to be a pit of oil, with no explanation on how that worked. Characters speaking in alien languages, but getting responded to in english. Stick to a language and add subtitles. Mixing between the two would never happen.
Now onto the general bits of plot that made no sense. 
- There was no overview or summary of the Houses and the political situation. You eventually grasp a small portion of this as the moview plot progresses but to add more impact an overview at the start of the movie would have added so so much. 
- An invading force blowing up the entire city that they planned to live in (the blowing up served no purpose as they had already won). 
- A needless sacrifice of a big name actor just to satisfy a vision, when he couldve just not done that and all the characters would've still survived. I assume this was done to evoke emotion but the relationship between the characters wasnt built up to that level. It felt like big name actors were cast in these parts to add that emotion rather than building up the characters themselves.
- There was no lore building of any kind and you were left to just make assumptions, which is fine, but not when it leaves you with 100 questions of why on earth would they do that (such as the secret cult of women playing both sides... to what end? how does any of this benefit them? They can control people at will it seems too. Why are they not using this left right and center to rule themselves).

2.0,"It obviously has top-notch production values and talent, and it's beautiful to watch... if you can stay awake. Surprisingly, the 2 hours and 35 minutes in this version covers less than half of the story we saw in David Lynch's 1984 Dune, which clocked in at 2 hours 17 minutes. Here, very little story is stretched thinly across so much time that it seems nothing substantial happens at all. And when it ends, there's no ending, no resolution. An abrupt stop with an assumption that we'll all show up for Part II... and yet, I can't say there was even a cliffhanger to suggest a Part II. Lynch's Dune was wacky and messy and far from perfect. But it was also more fun and had a great story arc with an ending, and at nearly 20 minutes shorter than this half-version. The craft is here but the storytelling is disappointing; it seems the film was developed by accountants and a committee that wanted maximum hours of content to fill-out a release schedule.

4.5,"Frank Herbert's Dune (and, to some extent, the subsequent collection) is one of, if not the grandstanding pillar of twentieth-century literature. Lauded by all and deemed unadaptable to film by many, Herbert's insanely dense worldbuilding and spiraling cosmos of themes is a beast like no other. Bringing Dune to the realm of film takes a small miracle every time, as several not entirely unsuccessful attempts have previously shown, but if there was one man up to serve the definitive job in 2021, it would be the modern master Denis Villeneuve. And, yes.

In the year 10191, the consciousness-expanding hallucinogenic spice melange has allowed humanity to populate the stars. Under a winding game of intergalactic political chess, Duke Leto I (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides is granted dominion of the spice's singular source, the desert planet Arrakis, by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, removing the tyrannical Baron of House Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) from his prior fiefdom. As Leto, his son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and lady, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), begin to lay roots with Arrakis' oppressed native people, the Fremen, in hopes of forming an alliance, the course of history is forever shaken when hostile forces converge against the Atreides in a no-holds barred vie for control of the planet and its precious resource.

I could watch Villeneuve's Dune forever. Words are but wisps in describing the majesty the director breathes into Herbert's world, an observant vision rooted in his earliest documentarian origins that allows the film's titanic scale to unfold as if by natural way. The magnitude is immeasurable, the scope no less than astronomical, and Villeneuve allows the rising stakes to speak for themselves through the sightly grandeur of Greig Fraser's incredible cinematography and visual poetry. Meanwhile, in a repeat of his and Benjamin Wallfisch's triumphant collaboration with Villeneuve on Blade Runner 2049, Hans Zimmer's rousing score has forever secured itself a place rattling through my bones, its grand multicultural influences informing the evolved, yet ancient landscapes and production designs of the year 10191. Wow.

Dune is as epic as it is elegant, and as a primarily experiential piece, has notably streamlined the clusters of thematic fibers Herbert's novel made its name on. There are still overtones of political machination, transcendent humanism, and messianic deconstruction, but the textures have been sanded down significantly, manifesting more by inference than the challenging, expounded philosophical provocations circulating through the source material. As the stark foil to the airy, extensively monologue-driven mysticism of David Lynch's unjustly maligned 1984 adaptation, the film's sensory richness does come with a notable cost to its simplified screenplay as Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth create no room to delve into character's heads, presenting Herbert's world as it is rather than what it's about.

The Lady Jessica misses out on some critical characterization as a result, fulfilling the role of Paul's mom and little more despite Ferguson's capable performance. Conversely, Skarsgård's Baron loses his overdone villainy and is polished into a figure of pure menace more appropriate to the story being told. Most other aspects remain intact and familiar in a perfectly cast troupe of actors, and while overall a somewhat diminished experience missing the lifeblood of the novel, any and every complaint also comes with the caveat that the film's bigger ideas could very well alight in Part 2. But as it stands now in 2021, Villeneuve is so cohesive and confident in his vision that his first trip to Dune proudly lives on as its own thing.",Hector V,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 28, 2021",Hector V,/user/id/977436384,RT,977436384,

4.5,"This is an incredible adaptation of Dune.  And now I need to give the obligatory mention that I've read the book so the major issues I have with the film are nit-picky issues to casual users.  However, I do think they are important issues--and ones that in a movie with the scope of Dune, should really be included.  In addition there are things that could have been dialed back as well.  

The Good - The movie is gorgeous, intelligently written, and (for the most part) well acted.  All the major bullet points it needed to hit from the book it hit.  It's also the perfect movie to go back to the theatre for and I hope it is successful enough to greenlight some of the other books in the Dune series.  

The Bad - Every time Paul (Chalomet) is on screen, he has to either have a vision, or have a Fremen character mention something about prophecy to him.  They beat him over the head with it SO much that we're only halfway through the story and the main character already believes he's ""The One"" they're all prophesizing about.  Same thing with his relationship with Chani.  She shows up in his visions SO many times that OF COURSE they're going to get together.  Meanwhile, there is very little mention how valuable water is (this will/should be VERY important in the next film) on Arrakis, very little of Uwe's backstory that is revealed--however, this isn't as egregious since there is ALSO no mention of his imperial conditioning (i.e. why he has a diamond on his forehead), and they gleaned over Shadat Mapes when she's actually really important.  

The Ugly - Jason Momoa is terrible.  Not quite Russell-Crowe-Les-Miserables terrible, but he's bad.  The role of Duncan needs more than Jason playing himself (as he did in Aquaman) or just painted up eye candy that just has to look pissed off all the time (as he was with Khal Drogo).  

In summary, while this version of Dune isn't perfect by any means, it's likely going to be the best adaptation out there for quite a while and is easily better than the 1984 version as well as the Syfy series.",Milhouse V,False,False,False,True,4.5,"Oct 28, 2021",Milhouse V,/user/id/977275580,RT,977275580,

5.0,"Easily one of the most epic movies I have ever experienced in the theatre. I couldn't stop smiling all the way through, I was almost overwhelmed with how good it was. The screenplay was of course fantastic, the scope and ambition of the environments was impressive, the performances were amazing, the characters were awesome and bad*ss, the score was powerful and enthralling, and the visuals were a sight to behold. I loved how realistic of a sci-fi movie this was and all of the concepts were very interesting. It's also a sci-fi movie with no actual alien races which I found captivating. I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone who loves Game of Thrones, Star Wars and even Lord of the Rings. Dune has been influential for the first two, so I can see those fans finding lots of things to love here. I would even recommend this to general audiences just because of how impressive and ambitious the movie is. This is a movie that needs to be supported as it is a not just a fast-paced action blockbuster. It has those elements but it also has higher intellectual concepts, which is what they call a ""thinking man's sci-fi"".

4.5,"Dreams are messages from the deep... Villeneuve's interpretation of Herbert's classic sci-fi novel is bold in how it does not try to appeal to mass audience and instead focuses on preserving its source material, in spirit if not always in its literal shape. There is much attention to the visuals here, more so even that the plot, but it all makes sense once you understand that it is trough the sheer scope of nigh incomprehensibly large spaceships and buildings that Villeneuve is trying to convey the magnitude and solemnity of Herbert's creation. This movie is an amazing experience to watch, it really transports the viewer into the far future of cosmic feudal grand houses, ruthless empire like the ancient ones used to be and nearly magical creatures, religions and philosophies. When you watch ""Dune"", you are on Dune, or at least you can feel the gravitas on being there, in that kind of universe. That being said, there is still a long, long way to go for this franchise, and I really do hope it will become a franchise, at least at to the point of the adaptation of ""Chapterhouse: Dune"", hopefully beyond.

1.0,"With two movies I had hoped to get a story more true to and more from the book.  Instead in the first half, we have been presented with a visual candy with a hollowed story concentrating on two characters, minimizing most others and deleting some out.  In the book Paul's character begins his journey as an adult physically but still mentally thinking more as an adolescent and then forced into his prophecy and become the mesiah.  In later books a path he shirks to his son.  But in the movie we see him act as a little petulant boy.  Where is the development of Raban and the Baron so you understand their motives.  Where is the emperor, Irulan, or Feyd?  Don't know?  Neither do I and it will be hard to insert them in the next movie and make them seem meaningful.  Dr. Yueh who betrayed and brought House Atreides down.  Why.... well that is pretty much glossed over.  No how his imperial conditioning was broken.  Why his imperial conditioning should be trusted.  Nope all that is gone.  We have big name actors play roles that they don't really fill but change the role to represent them and show off their heroics.  I understand that you can never duplicate the book, but man was this disappointing.  I am sure people who have not read the book will fall in love and the wonderful eye candy presented.  I just can't get over how hollow the film seems a mere shadow of this wonderful piece of science fiction.  At least the suspense of getting to see this latest creation is over and we don't have to wonder when the second film will come.  Watch the Sci Fi mini series for a much better story and tale.

4.5,"I really enjoyed this movie, it felt like a story that’s bigger than Star Wars, like there’s a much deeper mythology behind everything. Like the first half of the movie they basically were trying to break everything down & explain the mythology, introduce the environments, characters, & then the second half was where they had almost all of the action. The cast was amazing. Timothee Chalamet, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, & even Polka-Dot Man (can’t ever remember his name) & I’ve gotta say my favorite performance was probably Jason Momoa or Ferguson. Throughout the whole movie I couldn’t stop comparing it to Star Wars because it does seem like a Star Wars type story but without trying to compete with it, it’s almost like how we have Coke & Pepsi where it’s similar but not the same, I feel like people will start making discussions about Star Wars vs Dune almost like Marvel vs DC, even tho they both have the same feeling, they’re different stories, also the pacing somehow felt slow in the beginning when it felt slow but I was so into the storytelling in the first half that I didn’t notice how much time had passed until I looked at my phone & saw half of the movie had already passed. Is Dune better than Star Wars? I can’t say because this is one movie against multiple movies & shows. But I will say that I do think this movie is better than A New Hope which I know a lot of people will take offense to that but the storytelling & how much they were able to tell in the span of an hour in a perfect way is just insane & it’s not even overwhelming, like they were able to pace the story so well to where you can understand everything they’re saying just fine & I was worried when the 1st hour passed & there was no action but then I realized that the 1st hour didn’t need any action at all because of how good insight they gave to the whole story. I’m definitely rewatching this on HBO Max so that we can get a Part 2 as soon as possible because I want to learn so much more about these characters & these worlds & if you’re going into this movie trying to get fast action with a space theme then you’re probably going to be disappointed because that’s not what Dune is at all, tbh I expected that too but me not being a casual movie watcher was able to dive into the story & enjoy it & appreciate the world that’s just now getting started. I also want to say that I haven’t read any of the books or watched the mini series & movie, I went into this only with the trailers in mind & I feel like if the first Dune movie was recieved positively then this would’ve been a franchise equivalent to Star Wars & Star Trek because this movie just gave the story that potential & they better have Denis come back to direct because the way he sees this story & envisions it is what this story needs to become a franchise.",,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 27, 2021",,,Flixster,8f48b14d-ccfc-4f85-84aa-f2ba2bfb3521,

This movie inspired me to make an account and leave a review. It's a four-star film, but a five-star theatre experience. The sights and sounds are truly unbelievable. See this on the biggest screen you can.

The cast all did an impressive job, especially Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. The direction was solid. They found the perfect tone for Dune. The costumes, sets and space ship designs were all inspired and very interesting to look at.

Unfortunately, not every character felt fully developed. This led to a few greatly reduced emotional payoffs. However, major story moments are executed tremendously well, and are thrilling to watch.

Villeneuve put in the story telling so those who haven't read the book wouldn't be lost(like in the 1984 version). Great cast. Intense and fun to watch yet I kind of miss the over the top characters from the 1984 version. The cinematography is incredible so if you can catch this on IMAX, it'll be worth it. I'm glad they took the time to split this into two movies. There is such a deep and compelling story to tell and it's just not possible to do it right in a single movie. Must see movie without a doubt. The next one doesn't come out for a couple of years so I recommend the book if you haven't read it. It will amplify all the imagery for you.

5.0,"Saw Dune (part 1) on Imax today. Amazing! Denis Villeneuve is such a great director (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners). This movie covers topics ranging from political power, violence, environment, resources, culture, free will and fate, all in a high concept science fiction setting. This is not Star Wars but a thinking person's sci-fi story. The film is beautifully shot with many real sets, practical effects and real locations (with some CGI of course). The music score by Hans Zimmer fits the world perfectly. The acting, for the most part, is very well done by Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster and Stellan Skarsgard. Jason Momoa is fine but kind of reminds me of Aquaman in a desert suit. Although there is definitely some action in this movie, it takes its time telling the story without being overly drawn out. I felt everything was well explained, which is great for people that are unaware of the story or the books. My only complaint is that there were times where I thought the dialogue got lost in the mix, making it hard to hear certain lines or parts of conversations but that's it. This movie is the reason I still get excited to go to a movie theater, it's meant to be seen on the big screen.

5.0,"I was very surprised and refreshed at the fact that they took so much time to follow the book and make the scenes authentic. I had concerns with the choices they made concerning Dr. Keynes being a woman and Jason M. playing Duncan. I hope ""Duncan"" gets more into character if he is resurrected (like in the book) in future movies. If you haven't read the books you won't have a clue of what I just said!  I also hope they add much more to the musical score than those woman chanting to a middle eastern musical vibe. Although it went with the movie there should of been more musical changes to fit the scenes instead of constantly reverting back to the moaning and chanting. The ending was off as well. Chani saying, ""this is just the beginning"", was full of unnecessary cheese. Seems  a bit more thought could of went into something as important as the ending. I did like how they gave Jessica a lot more depth and emotion. Although I don't think a Benne Gesserit would have that kind of emotion, but then again...she did disobey the order and had a male instead of a female. So maybe just that fact that she did feel love for Duke Leto would give credence to those emotions.  I like the bagpipes and how they took the time to show Calladen.

However, the movie is excruciatingly slow. Not much happened and served more as a introduction- long exposition to explain this dystopia world. So when the movie ends abruptly, it didnt leave me wanting more. It was very unsatisfying. If the movie marketed itself as part one knowing there would be a part two to complete the story maybe I wouldve thought differently.

 The movie just feels incomplete. The pace is an issue which made me forget what the plot was about. The actors were fine. Zendayas role is more of a cameo.

And all of the obvious anachronisms--sophisticated personal electronic shields and flying machines coupled with tribes armed with knives and swords racing to do battle like something out of the Middle Ages.

2.5,"In its crawlling, nearly three-hour runtime, the 2021 adaptation of Dune does little to establish the universe or its characters.  I should disclose that I have not yet read the book, so I'm not comparing the film to something I think is better; I'm only judging this film on it's own merits.  
The biggest flaw in this version of Dune is its lack of character development.  We know nothing of the characters beyond their role in the plot, if even that.  Such is most true of Paul, the main protagonist.  Without knowing any of his motivations or internal struggles, the main conflict doesn't feel significant.  That isn't helped out by the second biggest problem, story structure.
This is only half of the story in the novel, but with almost nothing established, it seems so pointless.  The ball doesn't get rolling until half-way through, and it doesn't culminate towards any pay-off.  Much of this is due to the third biggest issue, editing.  
Especially after reading that the original cut of this movie was longer than four hours, it's baffling how the two and a half that we're left with lack basic character growth yet contain so much filler.  Transistions between scenes contain what feels like several minutes of beautiful establishing shots of space ships that ultimately serve no purpose other than to look cool.  Even the editing within scenes is jarring.  There are jump cuts during dialogue scenes, and the rhythm of the cuts overall is too fast-paced for such a slow-paced story.  
Before I acknowledge the positives, I'd like to nitpick one more thing.  Hans Zimmer's music is generic Hollywood's stereotypical Middle-Eastern sounds anytime a movie goes into the desert.  Just as many of his other scores, it's obnoxious and distracting.  
Now the things I liked about this movie are really only the cinematography and sound design.  Although I can't recall any stand-out shot composition, the lighting and color palette have that smooth, atmospheric quality you'd expect from a Dennis Villeneuve film.  The sound effects really show off in kind of a good way.  I don't really know what to say about the sounds other than I simple liked them.  
Well, that's about it.  I'm not disappointed as Dune fan, but I am disappointed as Dennis Villeneuve fan.

4.0,"I am a massive fan of the books, and I think this is the best Dune adaptation to date.  I'm not going to tell you what I liked, I'm going to tell you what I missed.  1. The movie is pretty slow, and they try to make it serious, but the tone wasn't really working for me.  I don't remember any part of the movie where there wasn't any noises in the background.  By noise I mean music, but its not music, its noise.  It gets irritating.  They could have broken up the movie a bit and made it slightly more interesting at points by using scenes from the book that they skipped, like the dinner party scene.  I understand that based on how much time they had, some things had to be sacrificed.  As for the tone, it seems like its one of worry, they tried to drive home the gravity of the situation but for me it didn't feel like it was dire.  More like a confused worry.  The Duke should have shown more confidence, with the exception of that one scene with Jessica, Paul was good but his character was a bit more.... confident..... probably driven by the slight change in the story line... Yueh had no depth, neither did thufir, Duncan was probably the best Character in the movie, Gurney the second.  Paul was alright though again he just seemed out of it most of the movie.  They could have done more to bring more emotion out of Timothee.  The most important part of the books to me was the intellectual side.  The plans within plans.  This is lacking big time.  One of the major things I missed was, the grand shots, there really weren't many if any at all.  Its one of the only things I really liked of the new Starwars movies.  Force Awakens, you have these amazing shots of the desert, the inside of the Star Destroyer, the X-Wings going over the water...  Not really that great in Dune.  Just to finish again I already said I am being hyper critical, it was the best Dune movie to date hands down.

5.0,"Not only does this film capture the audience with its' breathtaking and masterful cinematography, but honors the written word of Frank Herbert, in some scenes, to the letter. I went in with very high expectations, having read the book and become enthralled with the ahead of its' time world building and character development and was skeptical that it would be a hit with such a stacked cast of big box office names. I think overall the characters were cast correctly, and the chemistry between Oscar Issac and Timothee Chalamet was beautiful. It made what could have a basic scene between father and son, a relatable and deep conversation of love, trust, and the unforeseen future. The production design was mindblowing and the fashion of the future is something I'd happily sign up for today.

2.5,"We've settled for the vanilla and flaccid storytelling, the tired devices, dialogue, and familiar faces only Disney can give us. It's a pathetic and sad indictment of our current, desperately needy pursuit of comfort- which unfortunately portrays us as trapped(like Neo) engines of consuming, whose information is traded daily like market stocks, caught up in cookie-cutter, serial-driven Hollywood machinations that produce this type of placating cinema. It has become our national entertainment fare...

From the opening score, we find ourselves on the Star Wars landscape. We are looking into the faces of familiar actors, donning different garb, but we know them, and our warm-fuzzy sub-conscience follows with us, soothing our discomforts, calming us against any establishing shot's opening confusion. We don't have to think, we are not provoked by our uneasiness or disquietude with strange beginnings. We are never challenged.

This is not so with the work of David Lynch's Dune...
From the beginning, we are suspended in space with nothing to hold on to. I was at my local premiere of this movie. We were given a syllabus as we stepped past the ticket booth. It was unsettling from the moment we walked into the theatre and I believe the director(Eraserhead) and studio intended that from the start.

...and I didn't realize till years later, what the head of our halfway house, Clyde Burtram, was trying to do. He had known that David Lynch's premiere was something we would all look back on in awe, as a milestone in our recovery.
Jodorowsky couldn't achieve completing Dune and had said it couldn't be adapted, but looking back on David Lynch's work, I realize the guts it took and the sacrifice Lynch made to give the story quality. I like Sting's and Jose' Ferra's work in this version. I am drawn to the mystery of the Beni-Jesuits order, the political intrigues, and the dangers in the lives of those who wield power. It was as grand an event as any I had been a part of over the 23 years of my life at that time. I remember the whole night, even comments made to me by the housemate sitting next to me.

I want my entertainment to provoke me, to challenge me to imagine. I want it to impose ideas upon me that will be life-changing and stir creativity within me. I want the movie I've invested a portion of my leisure time to, to evoke in me a sense of wonder at life and all its multifaceted dimensions. I want it to make me erupt in either crying or laughing uproariously.
I am an artist, an ever-evolving creature, who revels in the impulsive explosion to create something alive, with a life of its own, something beating with a pulse. Villeneuve's work is Disney-derivative right down to the soundtrack. It's a shame how money is corrupting even our entertainment, making us a house pet who goes back to the same bowl of canned food, over and over and over...",Phil S,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Oct 26, 2021",Phil S,/user/id/11125c69-cda3-4864-8275-cb6e25c94227,RT,11125c69-cda3-4864-8275-cb6e25c94227,
0.5,"This movie is the definition of a bad movie. A big Box Office Bad. Why is it so horrible? All the actors, I like. It is watchable for the actors and some of the visual clarity of action.

I do not like the fact that they used images from sequels in the trailers. What you do begin to see is presented as though maybe you already expect it. The characters are under delivered shadow representations of something  that you can feel you might have had to known first to understand. The plot is simplified to such a degree that without knowing anything it is difficult to care about these characters. It is like this is the technical story board only. When they die. Oh well. When they betray each other, who cares. This movie delivers each scene as if it is a retelling of what happened in more detail on the other page. Then we have a montage before they leave the home planet with loud imposing music, it doesn't really communicate the loss that being given this duty of care taking a new world means to this family. They are leaving a paradise to live in the desert. I have to sit for too long to see nothing but a screen saver of shots that mean nothing to me or seemingly the main character. Who's development is rushed. His arch to leadership is forced, the is to accept him as though he did something that was not seen on screen. Nothing is earned in this film. It qualifies as a disaster-piece so much is wrong with it!

And seriously not happy for teasing future movies in the trailer! Yet, I no longer even care about it. What we got was a dusty rider on a worms back that had no compelling visual imagery at all. The one opportunity you had to give us a proud worm riding moment in a big screen way you killed the character before it could happen. 



""‘Dune' is a book that's like Proust. It's science fiction but it's very, very literary,"" Jodorowsky told IndieWire. ""It's very difficult to find images to put in the film because pictures are optical…The first time they said it was safe to do ‘Dune,' and [David Lynch] did it, I was ill, because it was my dream. They showed the picture in Paris, and my son said, ‘You need to see the picture.' I was ill to do that. Ill. And then they start to show the picture, and step by step, I was so happy because it was a shitty picture. I realized, ‘Dune,' nobody can do it. It's a legend.""

5.0,"Dune (Part 1) is undoubtedly one of the best films made in recent years, with the care, detail and majesty that only a mega-production like this can have, something that has not been seen for a long time in this part of the galaxy, reminding me for example of Lord of the Rings, not only because of how well done the movie is made, but also because of the plot, since I was confused at the beginning by so much lore that is thrown at us at the beginning, already like maybe 99% of the people who have gone to see Dune and have never read the literary work, we went completely blank to see this movie hehe, but as the movie progresses you can't help but want to know more about this wonderfully constructed world , and at the end of the film I am left with the feeling of satisfaction that I understood the plot well, although the details are still not well, basically what happened to me in my first encounter with the Lord of the Rings hehe, but surely when I saw a second one or more Sometimes, I will understand more about the houses, the empire, and how all this is connected to each other, without a doubt very interesting to see.
The most satisfying thing about this is to see that there is still much to do in the film world, there is still the possibility of seeing adaptations of books that are not only a cheap attempt to exploit a franchise, to ""subvert expectations"", to fill fees, etc. But to satisfy the viewer with such good works, and that at least in my thinking it must have been an adaptation that satisfies the staunch fans of Dune's original work.
A movie that I see from now on, shaping up to be among the best fantasy / sci-fi adaptations ever made, inside the ring of LotR, HP, etc., and since it is most likely a trilogy -I don't know if it is still confirmed-, it will enter Like those classic movie trilogies, it remains to be said that I look forward to the day Dune (Part 2) comes out.

0.5,"So bad that for 145$ milion and 156min they told around 40% of the story, that dune(1984) only succsesfuly show you for 45$ milion and 134min of screen time.
The movie is hold on only by Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin acting. Everyone els is like reading theyr scripts, do not want to be there and most of the cast dont fit theyr characters. 
Visuals are OK but to short or without much detail. CGIs are only far away shots that most of the time do not contribute to the story much ( Showing sand and telling its Dune do not make the viewer feel it but rather think of it as random desert shot anywhere in the universe. On other hand when the movie try to get in to the story of the book it misses everything important and the small details that make the characters and the great houses differenses, but succesfuly captures the scope of the conflict and its meaning. 
Fans of the books will get another disappointing movie with super powers in it.

5.0,"I enjoyed ""DUNE"" very much! It was visually stunning and had great action, a great story and plot and was true to Herbert's book. I loved the previously made movie of Dune as well! This was simply a better version due to enhanced special effects and with a few additional facts. If you are looking for pure entertainment to enjoy and escape from your daily lives this is the movie to see! Plus, for people like myself, who like to evaluate a movie for the many messages that it offers, this is also a great movie from that perspective! The actor's chosen to play the many character's in the film were also an excellent choice. Paul and his family members stood out the best as well as Jason Momoa, who is always the perfect actor for playing strong fighter's who also have a good heart and show caring for those he is involved with as a protector!

3.5,"Featuring unparalleled size and scope, Denis Villeneuve's Dune provides a cinematic experience while forgetting to deliver a complete story. To say the vision of Dune is grand would be an understatement. It's a visual feast combining elements of the Middle Ages with those of the future for a feeling that closely resembles HBO's Raised by Wolves. It's this marriage of genres that sticks out foremost in the opening minutes of the film. A noble house, House Atreides, has been assigned to guard and oversee a planet by the name of Arrakis, desert and useless but for its supply of spice mélange- the most valuable material in the known universe. This spice mélange, or ""spice"" as it's simply referred to, is a naturally occurring psychoactive chemical makes human beings stronger, faster, and smarter. Most of all though the spice is necessary for interstellar travel as it allows the navigator to properly guide ships through warp space. With a resource that valuable one could imagine that not everyone in the universe was happy to see Arrakis being taken by House Atreides. The Harkonnens, Arrakis' outgoing caretakers, are less pleased to be losing their financial boon and, though they honored the emperor's decree, seem eager to do something about it. In the middle of all this are the people of Arrakis, the Fremen, who live on the desert planet and who have been forever altered by their constant proximity to the spice. The Fremen have impossibly bright and blue eyes from their exposure and their ability to fight has been drastically increased for the same reason making them both alluring and frightening simultaneously. Arrakis itself, affectionately referred to as Dune, is a magnificent wasteland and home to giant sandworms capable of swallowing settlements whole. These worms use a sort of echolocation to hunt, homing in on vibrations that they can feel from the surface. The biggest of these creatures is referred to as Shai-Hulud and it is worshipped as a sort of God by the Fremen, who have adapted to living with these giant beasts. As you can see there is a lot of narrative being weaved into this cinematic experience, so much so that it would be easy to miss some of the above details in the film's first 30 minutes of mostly exposition. Once the places are set the story begins to lurch forward with House Atreides trying to protect the Fremen, the spice, and Arrakis from the Harkonnens and, by extension, the empire. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the young heir to House Atreides, though he is reluctant at the film's start. His father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), makes it clear that he is not some despotic ruler, and that Paul doesn't need to take the helm if he so chooses. Leto's demeanor is stark in contrast to his rival house and represents what is presented as a forward-thinking, perhaps even progressive leader. Paul's mother, Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), is the official concubine of Duke Leto Atreides and deeply interesting in her own right. Lady Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, an order of women hellbent on advancing humanity through genetic experimentation and religious engineering via their chosen one, known as the Kwisatz Haderach. This order also possesses several superhuman abilities like complete metabolic control, superior combat abilities, and The Voice. The Voice is simply a tone or frequency perfected by the Bene Gesserit that they use to compel others to do things, almost like a Jedi mind trick. With parents like these it's no surprise that Paul is special too. Even before reaching Arrakis Paul starts dreaming of a Fremen girl (Zendaya) who we later come to know as Chani. It's clear as soon as Paul steps off the ship that his fate is uniquely tied to that of the Fremen people as they refer to him as ""Lisan al Gaib"", which translates to ""tongue of the unseen realms"" and refers to the one who will bring water to Arrakis' desert world. There is so much narrative to follow that it might be easy to miss out on the unparalleled backdrops that make up Arrakis. For a desert world it's awfully pretty. Action scenes are a delight for much the same reason usually taking place against the backdrop of some sand dunes and an endless sky. There is one bone to be picked like a Fremen sword from a sandworm's maw and that's the personal shield devices. Having never read Frank Herbert's series this reviewer cannot say how true-to-form these shield devices are or how important their utility becomes, but from the onscreen presence all the shielding seems to do is make one-on-one fight scenes difficult to watch with the shield's constant blurring. They also seem to be an uninspiring device because they never seem to impede much damage. It's a minor nit to pick, in general, and there's reason to believe that as the series progresses it might settle better but in Part One it seemed gimmicky and unnecessary. Overall Dune's narrative sum is hefty, and Villeneuve's chosen path makes sense, but ultimately it leans so heavily on the inevitability of sequels that by the film's end it's easy to feel as if the story is just beginning. And it is, but there is an unsatisfying hunger that the viewer is left with, knowing full well that another entry is years away. It's the sort of conclusion that would have made most people stand and cheer if another episode was due to air next week. Alas Dune Part One is an epic table setting that certainly excites with the prospect of more dense sci-fi action to come, but after a nearly 3-hour runtime there's a stark difference between wanting more and deserving more.",Corey W,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 26, 2021",Corey W,/user/id/Facebook_2803286806561559,RT,Facebook_2803286806561559,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2803286806561559/picture

1.0,"Alright here is an honest review from someone with no prior bias or knowledge of the Dune books.  Umm pretty much wasted two and a half hours of my life for an incomplete movie.  So basically is not a movie that stands on its own, it's just a piece of a movie.  Took one and a half hours for the first fight scene.  Tons, tons and tons of face closeups.  They spent truck fulls of dough making the spaceships and cgi looks amazing like star wars, but considering there is only maybe 20 minutes of action in this piece I'm highly unsatisfied.  Felt like a sucker after 2.5 hours of this and than if I want to know the ending of the movie I have to wait another 2 years or so for them to even start filming it....and from the looks of it, I still might not get an end and have to wait another two years after that for another movie if i'm lucky.  Movie was made PG13 and I can't picture any of my kids sitting through this.  The one fight scene that could have been good ended without even showing how the  character got stabbed and died as camera was from the wrong angle.  This is honesty for you, hope it saves someone.  It's pretty, it's long and mostly boring.  I would recommend people watch it after the other movies are out to complete the story if anything.

1.5,"As a huge fan of the books, the Lynch film, and the SYFY mini series (both of them), this is movie was fucking trash. It removes everything that's unique and interesting about the world, it's surface quality only. Many will say this is a beautiful movie, but I found it all pale, beige, grey, washed out colors. Half the movie is wide angle shots of empty places (limnal spaces) and the other half is ""Fuckboi Visions"" of a terrible actress (did you SEE the spiderman films?) The entire cast is miscast, especially the mother, the father is made to look weak, the mother cries way too much for a stoic 'Archbishop' of her church, she helps him during the box trial (dumb AF, ruins the whole tension, and he doesn't even say the 'mind killer' poem, SHE DOES! WTF!?) I mean all of the men are neutered in this film except for Aquaman and the blue/red visuals of the shielding is annoying as fuck and makes everything under the blue/red blurry so all fidelity is lost and fight scenes look like blurs fighting blurs (and not in the good way, like Heroes Season 4, Ep 1 Knife Fight with Peter vs the Circus Assassin). I could go on and on, from the gender/race bending, to the absolute DRONING horns of the 'soundtrack' (whoever decided horns on horns on horns would be good, should be fired). It's so full of empty areas, empty moments, and insignifigant stuff that's not in the books or OG renditions, it feels like this is what a zoomer who read the cliff notes of Dune 10 years ago in college would make as a ""Dune"" movie. Paul is emo as fuck, while he looks good as a 'young lord' type, he lacks the acting ability, the emotional range, and his 'outbust' on his mom at that scene is so petulent and whiny. It's like he's basically Kylo Ren cosplaying as Paul Atredies. It's fucking pathetic.

Dune is a movie to watch in theater! You need the big screen to enjoy this opera!
Villenueve confirms that he is one of the top 5 directors in world! Visionary, uncompromising, faithful to his vision of things.
However, the power of this Cosmic Epic Tale is also thanks and perhaps above all by Hans Zimmer, who gives us yet another masterpiece soundtrack, which as far as I'm concerned already gives him the Oscar 2022 in the category.

4.0,"My review of Dune (slight spoilers)

We've had the movie from the 80s, the TV series, and of course the book of legend. I think at this point, the screenplay and director just assume that people have either read the book or had exposure to the Dune story and concepts in some way <cough Star Wars cough>. As a result, it seems much is left unexplained and/or unsaid in this movie.

Having read the book, in every scene I can look at the character's face and know their internal dialogue when they're not speaking. The 80s version had the characters think out lout for the audience to hear, whereas the 2021 version leaves it up to you to figure out. I feel many scenes were an homage to Stanley Kubrick, where he just shows you something with no explanation - creating a tone of mystery and other-worldliness. In fact the way the space ships were presented seemed like they were cut right out of the ""2001"" deleted scenes reel. 

I see this movie as a supplement rather than a stand-alone piece. As such it works very well. As always Denis imparts a sense of gravitas in every scene. He can pull great performances out of actors like Jason Momoa (his acting has been spotty in the past) - so the directing was top notch. The FX were mostly top notch and I feel like he absolutely nailed how the shields worked. 

Other things could have used more treatment, such as the large battle and the aircraft - for example it's not clear why some of the huge ships had their shields taken down and were destroyed. To be fair, this is a character driven story, so the action and sci-fi elements take a back seat by design.

One thing that made me subtract a star was how the melee fights were presented, especially the duel between Paul and Jamis. The melee fights were a big part of the book and were described in detail. In this movie they were often hard to follow  - maybe zoomed in too much or bad camera angle, or the frame rate or something. Films such as the John Wick series or ""Upgrade"" really raised the bar for fight scenes and I don't feel that bar was met here. There was one scene where Paul has a vision of being in a large battle, and it was very well done, maybe because it wasn't so zoomed in, it was a panoramic view - and I thought ""why didn't they do all the fights scenes like this""?

The casting was on point and the acting, especially Jessica Ferguson's, was a pleasure to watch. Timothée Chalamet did a great job of showing Paul's precociousness while at the same time showing vulnerability. The tone of Stilgar and the Fremen was accurately depicted for the most part - their ruggedness and innate spiritualism. The Harkonnens could have easily been overdone, but Dennis did a good job of keeping them from being cartoonish and one dimensional. The dialogue was often hard to understand - many lines were mumbled and the sound mix could have had the dialogue volume a bit louder. I wonder if Dennis does this intentionally for effect... 

While all of Denis's movies have pacing issues, with the exception of Sicario, I felt this movie did a good job of moving things along by strategically omitting certain parts of the novel.  The novel dragged and was slightly repetitive at times.  To be fair, there were some things omitted that I felt needed more treatment - like how using the ""voice"" required the user to be around the victim for a while before it could be effective, especially if the victim was strong-willed. An explanation of why laser weaponry was not ubiquitous would have been useful for newbies, otherwise it looks like a major plot-hole. Also a quick line about how computers were outlawed/abandoned by mankind would have helped set the background. 

As with most high budget films, the visual are stunning. The D.P. got all the angles on the actors and conveyed genuine artistry. Again, the fight scenes could have been done better, but everything else was eye candy. At times I felt like I was watching an ambient music video, which is totally fine because Hans Zimmer did the soundtrack... 

Making a Dune movie is basically putting a giant target on your back - much like Lord of the Rings, it has to live up to the legendary status of the novels while at the same time introducing the story to people who are totally unfamiliar with it. I feel this movie succeeded at both. There were certain notes that could have been hit that were not, but at the same time there were aspects of the movie that outshined the novel.",JJ A,False,False,True,False,4.0,"Oct 26, 2021",JJ A,/user/id/916612394,RT,916612394,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/635324304/picture

3.5,"I attempted to read Frank Herbert's novel Dune when I was in the seventh grade. I had begun to read more fantasy literature and was looking at older, heralded novels. I can still recall my frustration of reading those first five pages and having to repeatedly flip back and forth to a twenty-five-page glossary of terms so that I could even start to comprehend what was happening on the page. After those five excruciating pages, I gave up. Maybe I was too rash, and maybe my older present self would be more accommodating to the struggle, or maybe it just wasn't worth the effort. I never watched the 1984 David Lynch adaptation that was met with great derision from critics and fans alike, although it does have its vocal defenders (Hindsight alert: Lynch turned down directing Return of the Jedi to helm Dune). So when acclaimed filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) became attached to direct a big-budget, large-scale adaptation of Herbert's novel, I was finally interested for the first time in my life. It was originally slated to be released in 2020, and after the studio planned to release Dune onto its HBO Max streaming service, Villeneuve and the production company negotiated to make sure a theatrical release would still be an important part of the plan. Alas, I watched the 2021 Dune at home, and I found myself enjoying the experience and development of the world building. However, it's unlikely to watch this version of Dune and feel like you got a full movie for your money.

In the distant future, like 10,000 A.D., mankind has colonized worlds and the most important planet of them all is Arrakis. It's a desert world inhabited by poor natives, Freeman, who live a moisture-preserving life mining the natural ""spice,"" a special substance that makes space travel capable as well as prolonging human life. The top family houses are vying for dominance and House Atreides has been assigned by the unseen Emperor to rule over Arrakis and bring it and its spice production back in line. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) sees great opportunity but also great danger. The other houses will scheme to engineer the failure and desolation of House Atreides, especially House Harkonnen, led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), who is like a mixture between Marlon Brando from Apocalypse Now and Marlon Brando from The Island of Doctor Moreau (plus with levitation powers?). Paul Atriedes (Timothee Chalamet) is his family's heir and much is expected of him, especially from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who believes he may be long-prophesied messiah. On Arrakis, Paul and his father must tackle this very delicate new mission while keeping the many adversaries at bay.

As anticipated, Dune is yet another visually stunning and gorgeously immersive visual experience from one of the greatest visual filmmakers working today. If you can watch the movie on a big screen, or at least a bigger screen, then you owe it to yourself to do so. The sweeping vistas and startling science fiction imagery have so much power and grandeur to them. If Lynch's movie inspired a generation of devotees and impressionable children, I imagine that this superior modern version will do likewise. The production design and costumes are terrific and perfectly in keeping with the larger scope of the expansive visuals. You really feel the size of this world and its imposing weight. Villeneuve has such a natural keen eye for pleasing visual compositions, but he also has the patience many famous big screen stylists lack. He allows the moments to linger and to let scenes breathe in a way that feels more transporting and immersive. If you were simply looking for a visually resplendent movie-going experience, then Dune is the ticket. The sound design is also very smartly aligned and makes use of unconventional and alien sounds to make the movie feel even more like its own thing. When Dune came out in 1965, this was before much of the modern building blocks of our sci-fi pop-culture, so in a way while Dune was the influence it feels partially like an odd after-effect rather than a predecessor. The same thing happened with 2012's John Carter, based upon a novel a hundred years old that influenced many sci-fi adventure serials and now seems derivative even though it came before the many imitations. I was happy with the first 90 minutes of Dune and felt like the slow pace of the first hour, and its heft of needed but spaced-out exposition, was paying off with a thrilling assault. The concept of the protective shields is a smart way to communicate the casualties of battle, where ""kill shots"" are illuminated in red, informing the audience or a mortal wound. It makes for an easy to read visual to keep up with the development of battle and stay in a safer PG-13 realm. The whole rescue sequence on the mining station is thrilling at every step.

The cast is another major credit to the success of Dune. Chalament (Little Women) has a soulful yearning to him, to learn, to be his own man, to prove his father wrong and then prove worthy of his father's faith. Surprisingly, the next biggest role isn't Zendaya (Malcolm and Marie), the woman that Paul dreams about (prophetically?); it's Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep) as Paul's mother. She's a woman with deep secrets belonging to a powerful religious sect that might be the real power behind the throne. Lady Jessica is more Paul's mentor than any man. She teaches him to hone and focus his mind, to use the ""Voice"" to impart his will, and to prepare for the hardships to come. With every new exposition dump, and she has many, we learn about her growing concern for the fate of her son and her possible culpability for that fate. There's a genuine warmth between them that serves as the film's emotional core. I enjoyed watching Jason Momoa (Aquaman) and Dave Bautista (Army of the Dead) as opposite ends of Super Good Fighter Guy, though Momoa looked unsettling without a beard. Needless to say, the 2021 movie is far more diverse than the 1984 movie. It makes space feel more lived in when it's reflective of a diversity of people that we already have at this point in our history.

And then, after the hallway mark, Dune became a protracted sequence of chases and then I started to worry that things were just going to end in an unsatisfying manner, relegating the 150 minutes as setup for the as-yet-unplanned sequel, and that's exactly what happened. My mood began to deflate somewhat during the last hour of Dune. I was still interested and the visuals were still mighty captivating, but the events had the unmistakable feeling of being stretched out to meet a frustrating stopping point, a pause that didn't produce a satisfying endpoint. I just kept thinking, ""Oh, they're not going to resolve this,"" and, ""Oh, Zendaya is barely going to be in this movie,"" and the movie proved my predictions correct. It's hard to judge the movie as its own entity since it's so dependent on a Part Two that has yet to be greenlighted (though its strong opening box-office returns are hopeful). This is an expensive movie, possibly pushing $200 million, so it's quite a gamble to declare you would only be adapting roughly half of the story. Villeneuve's Blade Runner sequel, a movie I loved, had a budget of $150 million and a worldwide gross that didn't make the producers comfortable going forward with a Blade Runner 2050. To be fair, that was an original story, a sequel, and rather well contained. Still, it's an expensive sci-fi movie that has as much in common with dry art house fare as it does blockbuster adventures, like Villeneuve's Dune. The promise of a second movie is not secured. If Dune doesn't do well enough, we'll forever be left with a movie that feels designed to only be a teaser. It reminds me of the hubris of 2007's The Golden Compass where the filmmakers had a whole 20-minute finale that they carved out with the intention of having it be the opening for the assumed sequel (welp). Even when designing a multi-movie arc, it's necessary to plan each entry so that it can exist as its own beginning-middle-end and with a suitable intermediary climax. The Lord of the Rings movies each had their own climax, each moving the larger picture forward, and each had storylines and subplots that came to a head by film's conclusion. Dune doesn't. There are more dead characters by the end and certain characters are displaced, but it feels less like the end of the big-budget Dune movie and more like the conclusion of episode two of the Dune mini-series.

My resonance with the source material is minimal, but the world of Dune feels stuffed with stuff and not as deep in the realm of commentary. Fans of the book series will likely thrill at the level of minutia the 2021 movie luxuriates in, allowing fans to lap up the lore. For those of us uninitiated into the fandom, it feels like there could be more going on behind the scenes. The book was released in 1965 and has clear parallels to Middle East occupations and quagmires, a subject even more relevant in the first quarter of this new century. There's the occupying force coming in to manage the supposedly primitive natives on a desert planet, replacing the last occupier who made bold promises that were unable to be met by the reality on the ground. The parallels of colonialism are there and obvious, but that's because everything in Dune seems obvious to me. The bad guys are corpse-white and dressed in all black. They look like the alien zombies from 1998's Dark City (itself referencing the silent sci-fi classic, Metropolis). The leader of House Harkonnen is this noxious man who bathes in black goo and sucks the life force from others. I don't need my sci-fi to be ambiguous about its heroes and villains. We clearly recognize the bad guys because they're grotesque. However, the lessons learned by the heroes seem a bit stilted. Its attacks on capitalism are a little more nuanced but not much. The planet of Arrakis could produce water but that's not in the interest of the power brokers of the galaxy. They need the spice for the economy and thus keep the exploitative status quo. The parallels are there but there's not much more to be had other than direct summations. The movie has more to say with religion and messiah figures but at this point we're grading on a curve, and the more complex commentary attached to messiah figures seems reserved for a Part Two.

Another aspect I want to highlight that seems trivial but no less intriguing to me is how Herbert chooses his character names. We're eight thousand years into the future, spanning multiple planets with names like Arrakis and Giedi Prime and Salusa Secondus, and then we have such anodyne twentieth-century names like… Paul and Jessica? It's funny to me that Herbert goes to the trouble of coming up with so much jargon and terminology and alien-sounding names and then he says, ""Hey, this guy's name is… Duncan Idaho,"" like he's a supporting character in Point Break. I realize this is a very dubious criticism, and there are other character names to conflict with this assertion, but it made me laugh at the different levels of effort Herbert put into his world-building and universe than selecting character names for that same far away land.

After watching the new Dune, I went and watched the 1984 David Lynch version for the first time and was, quite simply, dumbfounded. I'll credit Lynch for many of the weird choices in style and how it never stoops to even be accessible for a mass audience, despite having characters explicitly narrate their schemes and motivations out in the open (by scene one, the power play that took up 90 minutes of Dune 2021 is awkwardly explained in full). By the end of Lynch's movie, it is an incomprehensible campy mess. I only have more appreciation for the 2021 Dune after watching the goofy (those eyebrows!) 1980s version that Lynch has disowned entirely, although that stirring guitar riff from the score still rocks thirty years later. The new Dune is only intended as Part One as its presumptive title promises, and because of this key artistic decision, there's a feeling of padding and wear by the end. I found myself reflecting back on the first 90 minutes more fondly. It's not that the last hour is absent great moments or audacious style, but it's hard to fully judge this Dune when its last line is its own conditioning of expectations: ""This is only the beginning."" The 2021 Dune is a visually remarkable movie experience with fantastic artists executing at some of the highest points of their talent. I'm eager to see if a Part Two can provide the satisfaction lacking in this beginning half. It's a hell of a start but it feels too incomplete and in need of an ending.

5.0,"This is the best/truest adaptation of the book to date.  (Keep in mind, this movie only covers the first 1/2 of the first book.)  The script leaves out a lot of the complicated, unrelatable Dune language, which makes it flow better.  

The acting is great, right down to most of the extra character actors.  The costumes are as realistic as one can expect for a sci-fi movie.  The special effects and digital renderings of the ships, Caladan, and Arrakis are superb.  

DEFINITELY watch it in a theater first.  It is huge in scale!

My only complaint is the same complaint that I have for ALL movies at this point:  the sound mix between the dialogue and the action scenes is completely infuriating.  Some of the dialogue is so quiet that it is difficult to hear, while the action scenes are so loud that they nearly blow your eardrums out.

5.0,"The soundtrack is insanely thrilling and fascinating. All the percussive sounds and deep low rumbling noises that Hans loves to use. That opener is kind of ominous but also incredible. Omg what am I getting myself into?! This is exciting. The sound design that Zimmer created with his music and sound effects is amazing. Experimental and bombastic. 

How is the House of Atriedes just going to blindly accept some mission like that without any knowledge or background of what their mission entails? They have no idea what they're getting themselves into. Very interesting concept with the whole wrist gadget that creates a personal force field. Blue meaning a hit and red meaning a death blow. I really liked the subtleties during the conversation with his Asian doctor and mother. The way his doctor spoke to him in Mandarin and warned him, and then his mother doing sign language, telling the doctor that this event never happened. That whole scene with the old lady dressed in black robes was something else. It seems Paul has been handed down some sort of powers from his mother. He has the gift of visions. 

Arrakis seems to be a very religious planet, resembling much of what seems like Islam. I love how shrouded in mystery everything is regarded to Paul being a chosen one. Holy shit, the harvester in the desert looks just like the box that Paul put his hand in to test his pain threshold. Holy fuck man that sandworm is terrifyingly enormous. It could probably swallow up moons. Jeez man, these Harkonnen are fucking ruthless. Damn, Leto went out like a straight G. And Duncan too! Holy shit! Fight till the last breath, literally. Dude the technology that the Harkonnen possess is terrifying. The laser that can literally cut through anything is horrifyingly powerful. That was incredible, it was almost as if the sandworm was acknowledging Paul. That's so crazy how Paul had to kill the one Fremen member so that he could be accepted into their community. He had never killed anyone before that. My worry is that Paul's mother vows extreme loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. What if they use her as an inside spy to infiltrate the Fremen? That look that she gives at the end made me question what her motives are. Things are going to get really interesting in the next movie and I cannot wait. 

Exquisitely shot. Every shot seems to have a purpose, and each one is beautiful. The imagery is incredibly epic and grand in scope. And the cgi is actually impressive. A lot of the artistic designs and concepts for the objects in the movie are very original and beautiful to look at. Already this movie is making a poignant statement on business greed, land ravaging for resources and colonization. I love the overall ominous tone of the soundtrack that gives off this stepping into the unknown feeling that makes it both exciting and uneasy at the same time. Ok, Denis was 100% inspired by Star Wars for this movie, no doubt about it. Some of the interiors seem to be inspired by H.R. Giger. A lot of the objects in Atriedes home world seem to be inspired by ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphics and such. The lighting is beautiful. Perfectly casted and exceptionally acted. This movie is filled with a powerhouse cast of actors. 

Beautifully epic. Everything looks incredible in this movie! Omg I can't get over it. There's so much to look at. From the wardrobe design, to the interior design, to the lighting, the colors, the objects, the space ships, the film locations, the grand scope of the sets. It's overwhelming to say the least. The lore is incredibly rich and pretty deep - fascinating. All the different languages and factions, all the technology or lack thereof. An absolutely exciting enthralling epic that also has elements of suspense and mystery. Beautifully ominous imagery all throughout. And of course in great Villeneuve fashion, the compositions of his shots are magical. It's themes on fear and overcoming fear, charging head on into it is inspirational and motivating. It's been a pretty dull and stale year to say the least (2021), but this movie right here just made it all the better, it gave me hope for the next. The movie was incredible, amazing. I didn't want it to end. I was immersed in the world and its characters. It's incredible what Denis and his team were able to create just from adapting the book. I mean he's basically creating a new franchise, sort of speak. He's paving the way for the Dune universe to be expanded upon. Maybe a tv show or something? Idk maybe not lol maybe wishful thinking.

2.5,"Ridiculously overpraised. If you haven't read the books, the film provides next to no context or lore information, which is a serious problem. To make matters worse, not much actually happened, which worsened the pacing, and the ending was an unsatisfying cliffhanger for the next film. The plot was predictable and can be summarised as three events: the home planet, all hell breaks loose on a visit to another planet, and the main character and his mum have to traverse a desert. It was literally that simple in 2 hours 35 minutes, which probably wasn't long enough to get through the contents of the book properly. There was some action, but it was generally unimpressive, with some of it being overreliant on explosions. The combat was largely silly due to armour that turned out to be pointless and some fake looking choreography (e.g. the final fight). The characters weren't bad, but they desperately needed more development. Again, there was barely any information on the doctor, who the emperor was, who the fat man was, who the witch lady was, and so on. There was, however, some funny and appropriate dialogue, although not much dialogue overall. Similarly, the cast was solid, the acting was mostly spot on, the cinematography was beautiful, the visual effects were excellent in many cases (e.g. aside from several scenes, like this full CGI scene of fighting with a mugshot of the main character appearing as a visor was lifted), the sets/props/costumes were high quality, and the soundtrack was decent besides too many moany screams.

Similarly, we are told very little about the Emperor, and why he would want to play these great houses off one another in such an elaborate trap.  This and other major gaps leave the great characters in endless action sequences lacking context or gravity.

4.5,"***NO SPOILER REVIEW***

Denis Villeneuve has struck gold again with his latest directorial outing of ""Dune"" or ""Dune: Part One"" as it is displayed in the opening of the film. Be warned, this is not a complete story but instead sets the groundwork for a, fingers-crossed, ‘Part Two'. Even those that have read the 56 year old source material by Frank Herbert will likely take enjoyment in what is at the end of the day a quality piece of cinema. As with ""Blade Runner 2049"", also directed by Villeneuve, the film has some of the finest production design, visual effects, score, and acting talent one could hope for. Unlike ""Blade Runner 2049"" however the story is presented in a more approachable style. Where ""Blade Runner 2049"" was very abstract and misleading in its plot ""Dune"" adheres to a more straightforward approach. ""Dune"" accomplishes this by leaving out a lot of the complexities of the politics involved that are described in the novel. This is something that may put off book purists but it does serve a purpose in keeping the pacing of the film from stagnating. Everything is boiled down to its most basic component for the sake of moving the plot along. At 2 hours 35 minutes this helps move the audience through the first two hours quickly and only slows a bit in the final thirty-five minutes as you approach the end.

With Paul Atreides we get another superb performance out of Timothée Chalamet. He gives a far more relatable performance as Paul and his slow descent into destiny as the story unfolds is handled in a uniquely muted style not seen previously with the character. The supporting cast could occupy a review of its own so I will say that all but two cast members turn in excellent performances. The only two that were lacking for me were Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet Kynes and Chen Chang as Dr. Wellington Yueh. In the case of Chen Chang I don't really blame the actor as the character was the one given the least service by the script. Regarding Sharon Duncan-Brewster she simply did not have the gravitas to play the role of Dr. Liet Kynes. Both small nitpicks as the performances were not terrible they were just the two weakest links in a very strong chain.

Although this film is available to watch at home on HBO Max it is most definitely a movie theater experience. I saw it in IMAX and I urge anyone that has access to one to see the film in that type of theater. The cinematography is beautiful and truly takes advantage of the screen size when scenes shot for the IMAX are presented throughout. The sound is palpable and envelops the audience but occasionally the dialogue is lost behind the action or the strong eclectic score by Hans Zimmer.
As a film I would give this a 9 out of 10 or an A- and leave it at that. Of course I cannot resist making a book comparison and pining for my favorite chapters/material that did not make it into this film so as a book reader I would give it a B. As a friend of mine said in the theater, ""This ain't no Marvel film,"" so when the credits roll the movie is in fact over with nothing else to see.",William Q,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 25, 2021",William Q,/user/id/871772629,RT,871772629,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1554181320/picture

4.0,"The spice must flow.  So on the dangerous planet of Arrakis, the most valuable commodity in the universe is harvested: spice.  There is to be a changing of houses for who is in control of the planet, shifting from Harkonnen to the Atreides.  This is about the son in house Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) figuring out what his role is in all of this, as he had been having visions of Arrakis even before he got there.  Now I'm a big-time David Lynch fan, so of course I have seen the 1984 version.  I could never truly follow what the movie was all about since it is mostly unintelligible without the aid of a roadmap, but I was nevertheless excited to see what beloved director Denis Villeneuve could do with the material.  The trailers looked stunning, and I don't think there will be too many disappointed people who looked forward to this.  Now since I've seen the Lynch film, the thing I was most worried about was how difficult this was going to be to follow.  This is presented in such a fashion that you don't need a glossary of terms to understand what is going on.  Yes, this is hard science fiction, but they make it digestible.  They tackle exposition without making it feel like exposition, and that is the magic trick that makes it all work.  Also, the cinematography in this is drop-dead gorgeous, which has long been a staple of Villeneuve's library.  Even if the story isn't grabbing you, you're going to be wowed by the eye candy at the very least.  I opted to watch this on HBO Max because I wanted to view it in the morning since it has a long runtime, but I think you will get more out of it if you see it on the big screen.  Also, even though this is two and a half hours long, it isn't a struggle to get through.  Yes, I took my fair share of bathroom breaks, but I always wanted to pick it right back up without my attention or focus wavering.  I love the entire cast in this, and it seemed like everybody was hand-picked with foresight in mind.  It's an ensemble piece as well, and I don't think anybody upstages to steal the show.  I don't even think you need to be a sci-fi junkie to appreciate this.  This is basically Star Wars with a denser mythology, less comedic relief, and a healthy dash of Lawrence of Arabia.  The story is surprisingly accessible now that it has been handled correctly.  My only real problem is the same issue that I have with Infinity War: you're only getting half a story here.  There's a part two in the pipeline, and I'm looking forward to it.  The deck seemed stacked against Dune for financial success, so I sincerely hope we don't end up with a half-finished story since this is not exactly a cheap movie to finance.

5.0,"The latest film adaptation of Dune is an incomplete* slow-burn story that definitely felt like it was done by a fan of the books with enough goodwill from previous movies to be allowed creative control unlike poor David Lynch. The world-building is immersive, the performances from the large ensemble cast are great, the soundtrack kicks ass, the narrative is compelling, the sound mixing is downright phenomenal and the cinematography certainly knew how to keep my attention. It does have a desaturated look that can be jarring for a space opera, especially if your first Denis Villeneuve film was the gorgeous-looking Blade Runner 2049 but I thought it was a good conscious decision. Dune's not meant to be Star Wars and it didn't feel as pretentious as the sound mixing in Tenet simply because it worked for Nolan in Interstellar. At least, unlike Solo, I can actually tell who's who and understand what the hell is going on. And while Dune isn't an action movie, the action that is there is well-choreographed and intense, especially during an attack when the shields are lowered by the traitor whom, just like that floating fat man the Baron, I will not tell you who it is. At least the shields don't have the awkward blocky look of the 1984 film that unintentionally reminds you this is an '80s movie. As for costume design...it's not worthy of mockery but I'm surprised at the lack of swab test memes given the tubes up the noses of Paul, his mother and the Fremen. Oh, and also, there's no annoying inner monologue like the '84 film. Everything can be understood perfectly within the context of the film, even in scenes without dialogue. All in all, Dune is a slow-burn adaptation of an iconic piece of sci-fi literature that definitely feels like a love letter to the book that makes me hopeful that the movie will make enough money for Villeneuve to be able to continue the story in a Part 2. Just remember that it's more Game of Thrones in space than it is Lord of the Rings in space; in other words, more focused on political intrigue than it is on epic battles, even if it does still have its share of action. Just a word of advice is all, for your expectations' sake.

Pros:
 - Beautiful! The visualizations of the worlds is better than I had hoped for.  It's just gorgeous to watch.  I'm going to go see it again on IMAX for this reason alone
- Easy to understand - Dune is a complicated story with lots of complex dynamics, but the filmmakers managed to walk the tightrope of giving you enough to understand what was happening without overloading
- A ton of fun - lots of action, drama, and fun moments to keep you entertained

Cons:
- Long runtime - it is worth the ride, but the film is long which can be a challenge for those with busy lives or short attention spans
- Not enough of some characters - I know these contradict, but I would have loved to see more with some of the best and well acted characters.  No spoilers here.  Just saying that the Baron was amazing when he was on the screen :)

5.0,"The nearly 40 yr old consensus that Dune was “unfilmable” is disproven in authoritative fashion. Dunes intimidating runtime feels surprisingly short (even on a second viewing) due in large part to the scope and scale of cinematography/VFX used to craft Dunes expansive backdrop. There’s simply no way to appreciate all the detail on the first run through. Trailers don’t do the scale of this movie justice, and will only provide some idea of how this film all but demands that it be seen in a theater. Equally convincing of the theater experience are the aggressive sound design and film score. Praise and attention should be heaped on here come awards season for what is accomplished in aiding the creation of Dunes foreign yet tangible environment. From the shocking use of “the voice” to the guttural feeling of beating ornithopter wings, this is one of the rare cases where sound “ambushes” rather than just “transports” the viewer. Character development in a narrative so expansive is the only place die hard fans could claim Dune suffers at all (Skarsgards Baron Harkonnen will need to dominate the sequel to begin to do this character justice or elaborate on his role in the overall plot). It should be noted that this lone issue is only due to the necessity of hitting so many necessary plot points while almost entirely excluding the novels generous use of inner monologue, a challenge I am hope I’m not alone in seeing Villeneuve tackle head-on. Dancing on this tightrope of pace and detail then is surely the reason for the relentless tempo of the film, which offers no room to breathe past the first act. Make no mistake though, Dune is far from “frantic”. Viewers who were unfamiliar with the novels had no problem following Villeneuve’s storytelling in both of my viewings. Conversely those familiar with the books appreciated how this nearly pitch perfect adaptation remains faithful to the source material in almost every way. This is where Villeneuve deserves the most praise, in pleasing both of these crowds. As an example, fans of the novels might catch a quick glimpse of Gurneys baliset next to his bed as he wakes for battle, while those new to the story won’t suffer through any lengthy instrumentals during fremen coffee service. Directorial choices like this will leave both groups wanting more of this world and it’s characters and are ultimately why Dune deserves all the accolades it’s receiving in pleasing both crowds.

4.5,"There are three kinds of Dune fans – those who have only seen the movie(s), those who have read the books and seen the movie(s) and Dune fans who have read the book and not seen the movie(s).

I have read the series a few times now and am rereading it now, currently into Book 5 – Heretics of Dune. I absolutely love literary Dune. I love the depth, breadth and scope of what is, by all accounts, an epic easily as complex as Lord of the Rings and other major epics.

Much of what became the original Star Wars trilogy was stolen directly from the previously published Dune but one only needs to call it homage or influence to avoid issues.

I had first attempted to read Dune when I was 15 and failed spectacularly. It was SO HARD to get into and unlike anything I had ever read before.

Then in 1984 David Lynch's movie Dune released and 16-year-old me went to see it. I was entranced by the film. I loved the visuals, the battle scenes, the mystery, pretty much everything. That film made me go back to the books and this time I voraciously read them all the way through. I was captivated.

Now I still enjoy David Lynch's Dune and I realize this is a controversial stance. When I take out the DVD and rewatch it (as I do sometimes) adult me recognizes a film that is a wonderful mess. It is a film that clearly collapsed under the weight of the source material but is still dragged across the finish line.

The music is not bad but suffers occasionally from that early 80s tendency to throw in heavy pop rock and metal flourishes that bind it so securely to its era. There is so much internal dialogue (thoughts) presented that the viewer rapidly gets lost in the ridiculousness it. Sting in a leather diaper – need I say more?

Visually though the original film is still wonderful and I believe worth watching but I understand and agree with most of the detractors.

Fast forward 7 years from Lynch's Dune and you get a new film from talented Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who has already given us fantastic sci-fi in Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival.

This Dune is not your father's Dune, as they say.

Everywhere Lynch went with excess Villeneuve choses understatement. Where Lynch overwhelms the view with TOO MUCH TALK with all the internal dialogue layered on top of the regular dialogue Villeneuve pares back. Lynch was likely responding to the breadth and depth of the source material doing his best to cram as much explanatory dialogue in as he can. Villeneuve seems to recognizes where this is futile and essentially seems to say –

""The viewer will have to connect the dots.""

This is a wise choice if the director has laid out the dots in a way that they can be connected. Thankfully I believe Villeneuve does this.

Visually the film is immense and grand on the scale of Cecil B. DeMille's The 10 Commandments. The grand scale of this universe dwarfs the characters making humanity seem insignificant in the face of nature and geopolitics. The brilliant presentation of starships, and various other sci-fi vehicles is unlike any other sci-fi film you will ever see.This contrast will play out well and draw out the necessary awe as the narrative continues in part 2.

Speaking of part 2 it should be noted that this film is very intentionally titled Dune: Part 1. Like The Fellowship of the Ring, Dune: Part 1 will make no sense without the follow-up. The film ends with the words ""this is only the beginning"" and you know that Villeneuve has essentially created a great and wondrous prologue for the feast that is hopefully to come.

The best phrase I can use to describe Dune: Part 1 is ""less is more"" which I realize may not make sense when you think about the adjectives I have used to describe the film ""immense"", ""epic"", ""enormous"" etc. But I hold to this. While the visuals, music and the stage are truly majestic the choices in dialogue and action are intentionally spare, almost Zen-like., The choices in the film line up with the source material in this way,. We have very small, human characters caught up in a universe spanning maelstrom and to fight against such a storm would be futile so Villeneuve does not fight it – he moves with it and allows it to carry him, the film and audience along.

Dune: Part 1 is successful in its adherence to the source material to the point that what may be perceived as flaws in the source material (little humour and where humour exists, exceptionally dry, one might say desert-like, humour) those flaws come through in the film.

The acting is also fantastic. The performances of Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan Skarsgard and Timothee Chalamet are standouts to be sure. Brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling and Benjamin Clementine are also standouts. Speaking of Clementine this is his first acting role and he is absolutely wonderful. He is definitely a talent to watch.

Dune: Part 1 is a fantastic film. If you have never read the books you will come away wanting to in order to fill in some gaps. If you go to the film expecting a stand-alone sci-fi spectacle like Star Wars you will be disappointed. This is a film for those committed to a saga.

I was captivated and find it hard to imagine anyone doing a better job taking what has been called an ""unfilmable book"" and translating it to the screen. BTW – you should DEFINITELY see it in a theatre.

I'll admit, my biggest concern before watching the film was the casting of Jason Momoa, who seemed a bad fit for Duncan Idaho, but was actually fantastic in the role. Timothee Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, and Zendaya (in what little we see of her) also deliver riveting characters. And the director's gender swap of Liet Kynes was a stroke of genius as Sharon Duncan-Brewster gives the character a depth that defies her screen time.

The one failing in Part 1 is the portrayal of Lady Jessica, who comes across as shallow and overly frail for someone with the power and fortitude to have rebelled against her order and successfully navigated the politics surrounding her.

5.0,"As a long-time Dune fan, I couldn't wait when it was announced nearly a decade ago. Then came the trailer and I felt myself preparing for the hype and possible letdown, as Dune is notorious for being hard to adapt for the big screen. The Lynch version flopped and the series was relatively good- as possible as the low budget let it be.

Finally I was able to see it. And it was glorious. They left out certain scenes, making the development of a couple of characters lacking (dr. Yueh for example), but in the grander scheme of the movie, it didn't matter as much. There were multiple stories to tell and it did it well. I am most certainly going to watch it again and buy it when it comes out.

My main gripe is that this isn't the day and age for movies such as these. It lacks utter 'woke'ness and other, 'politics' and it doesn't force-feed the story, its nuances and action the way most movies do nowadays. It's a slowburn of a movie and I fear most people will dislike it because of that.

4.0,"Dune has finally been cracked. After David Lynch's curious adaptation, it didn't look hopeful. Despite the fact that Dune has been the root of many great sci-fi franchises and films - I'm looking at you, George Lucas - it just didn't seem to work. Warner Bros. themselves coined Dune as being ""unfilmable"" - that is, until Denis Villeneuve decided to take it on.

I can imagine that, for secondary audiences, this will become one of those films where, part way through, you entirely lose track of the plot, however you're kept in a trance by the alluring cinematography and glamorous special effects. And Timothée Chalamet. Although there's much to unpack and a substantial amount of thinking required, Dune does not disappoint.

Dune begins with an ear-splitting voiceover, with it coming our first glance of Zendaya as Chani, a member of the Fremen. We arrive on the planet Caladan, home of House Atreides and birthplace of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a prodigy with contiued visions of his future. His father, Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is tasked with ruling Arrakis, a planet rich in a mysterious substance known as Spice, capable of extending human life. The preceding rulers of the planet, House Harkonnens, aren't happy about this, and will do anything they can to make House Atreides' time on Arrakis as miserable as possible.

Not only does Dune feature a spectacular main cast, but we also see some familiar faces in the supporting cast; Rebecca Ferguson is Jessica Atreides, wife of Leto Atreides, a dominant woman ready to put anything on the line to aid her son. Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin are Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck (respectively), both powerful warriors and close friends of House Atreides. House Harkonnens consists of Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista and David Dastmalchian, all of whom sport frightening bald heads.

3.0,"I didn't read the book, so I went into this expecting it to stand on its own. I pretty much understood the story, but as the title frame states, it's Part I. Dune is genuinely spectacular, the wonder of its CGI is that it doesn't like a fantasy version of our world, it looks like the real version of an imaginary one. It's interspersed with scenes shot in remote corners of the world that have rough, spectacular landscapes, for a great effect. The villains are numerous and villainous, the good guys are virtuous. Regular space cowboys.

Chalamet is not a convincing hero, playing it more as a bewildered boy who doesn't really want to join the family business. It's hard to see him rising to heroism, like I said it's Part I so he didn't have to. Zendaya's talent seems to be always appearing adolescent regardless of age. Lucky for both of these unfortunately cast persons, the other roles are strong, particularly the supporting good guys.

2.5,"After reading so many positive reviews, I thought I had seen a different movie. I've read Dune twice and the sequels once so I have a good understanding of the story and the characters but the movie did nothing to convey either.
It seems that Villeneuve decided to substitute special effects for plot and character development. The CGI is pretty good however the script needs more substance to tie it all together. The characters do not have established personalities to show motivation for the things they do nor do they have believable reactions to the things going on around them.

4.0,"I am a fan of the 1984 release version.
That said, this version will make it I hope, if only to see the next 2 parts.
The cast seems to be well selected for the known actors, the new ones, I am on the fence.
This movie got ""Slow"" in a couple of places, however, the storm scene and the mechanical dragon fly was probably the greatest, at least for me.
Its a shame that the movies profitability was undercut by releasing it to HBO the same day as the Big Screen release.
I have always gone to the theater to view a film, and then decide whether to supplement it by purchasing a disk or recording. 
Streaming, IMHO, is ruining the movie industry..

Add in a well adapted screen play and strong acting from the entire cast and you end up with the most exciting Sci-Fi franchise launch in a long long time.

Its almost as if the pieces of the book that did not make it onto the screen are still happening just outside of frame. What prevents me from going all in on this Dune is that I felt there were pacing issues. That a lesser emphasis on the imagery would have allowed more time to fully form Dune's complex political and social systems, as well those House Atreides itself, and therefore given us more connection to its down fall. Ultimately this is successfully papered over by Chalamet's captivating acting, which never misses a beat and carries our attention ever deeper into the the World of Villeneuve's Dune.

4.0,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" is an ambitious, thought-provoking and sweeping sci-fi epic that showcases sparkling stars that align when beauty of Middle Eastern culture isn't buried beneath dusty wars in faraway galaxies. With his tenth feature, Villeneuve runs sharp blades across post 9/11 mythologies by drawing rich analogies with centuries-old Islam history of one of the world's most misunderstood countries. It's Villeneuve's first attempt to reinventa classic book from an Islamic perspective on the big-screen, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Villeneuve draws viewers into space odyssey a heroic heir takes to save his planet's resource-rich spice commodity. Villeneuve's decision to shoot the film in real-life locations across the Middle East is risky, but it pays off tremendously. Inspired by David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"", Villeneuve effectively employs authentic Arab locales to create rich cultural authenticity seldom seen in sci-fi movies. Villeneuve showcases immense control over action sequences, produ-ction design and music, crafting a memorable cinematic experience. Villeneuve's screenplay is also sensational, and effectively uses a dream-flashback structure to convey a messiah's journey. It's hard to not praise phenomenal cast performances. Timothee Chalamet delivers his finest performance to date as Paul Altreides. With mesmerizing expressions, he captures anger, determination and self-doubts of an inquisitive family heir that seeks to savehis resource-rich planet. Rebecca Ferguson  is also remarkable in the role of a tormented mother that puts her life on the line to protect her son. The final standout in the cast is Oscar Isaac. As a duke that doubts his son's heroism, he brings paternal affections to the movie. Although ""Dune"" is undeniably an unforgettable sci-fi epic, ultimately it isn't a flawless film. It's dustily paced, and loses momentum towards the end. Moreover, the film builds to a head-scratching ending that seems intended solely to setup a sequel. Nevertheless, fans of the celebrated novel will enjoy ""Dune"" and so will movie-goers seeking thought-provoking entertainment. As rebel alliances that've often underestimated powers of invader empire foreigners, it's high time Hollywood awakened to force of one of the world's most alien-ated countries by opening planet of apes' pod doors to Muslim communities even when their victories over terminator-ed fatherly adversaries have been considered flukes since inception of 9/11 ideologies.",Hassan I,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 25, 2021",Hassan I,/user/id/Facebook_1451588882,RT,Facebook_1451588882,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1451588882/picture

5.0,"Where do I start. Wow! Masterpiece. I've been looking forward to seeing this...ever since I read the book thirty-five years ago.

I've read the book four times. When I was young, the book was way too deep for me. It took a second and third time BEFORE I started to mine the brilliance in the story. It also took experience as a reader to understand the pacing and the characterizations.

The idea of adapting something THIS dense into a movie (or a couple of movies) takes real vision. This IS the definitive version of Dune the movie.

When I heard that my favorite living director was going to take the reigns of this productions, I couldn't think of a better helmsman. Then I started seeing the casting choices, the cinematographer and then the person who was going to write the score. EVERYONE is at the top of their game.

I have been in talks with my friends that have NOT read the book(s)...but decided to go see the movie FIRST, then afterwards read the book. AND almost every one of them has thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The only complaint that I heard from one, was that they had NOT known that this was JUST Part One of a two parter. BUT that did not disuade them from wanting to read the book.

AND in some ways, now the book will make MORE sense for a LOT of people from the start. Denis has a way of translating difficult ideas into visual dynamism.

Now that we've seen it, I cannot have ever truly believed that someone could take the text and visualize it as perfectly as he has. The tone is perfect. The idea of spending more time on Caladan was brilliant, to build the foundation of the battles to come...by seeing them deposed from the safe and stable planet and placed in charge of a brutal planet. Then allowing the Harkonnens to decimate them ""where they stood"". An extermination.

The acting is amazing. Timothy Chalamet does an amazing job of being niaeve, but also capable. To show the boy, but to see the god (below the surface). He plays that juxtaposition perfectly. The Still tent scene is a Oscar worthy performance.

Rebecca Ferguson is able show her vulnerability, but also her fierceness. Oscar Isaac as a father doing his best, but put in a no win situation.

Stilgar played by Javiar Bardem...was almost unrecognizable. The gravitas that he brought to his character. The aloofness in front of the Atriedies, but the calmness and security when he was with his people, the Fremen.

Also Chani being played by such a talented actress in Zendaya. Just her look, alone sets the stage for the events that transpire from here onward in the next few films (if we are blessed with a Part 2 and then Dune: Messiah)..

Hans Zimmer's score is amazing. So evocative of the primal world and Maudib's place within this raw world. Just listening to the score was a treat.

I do hope that this movie is financially successful, for we truly deserve a Part Two...to allow a further installments of this vision.

There were numerous times that I started crying. It was almost a religious experience...which it should be...for that is the story itself. The idea that the confluence of all the planning and the coming together of everything, to change the world...and he's right here. Making his first steps. Ugh. So good.

4.5,"Don't judge a book by the first half of it.
By Paul Sidharta

I can say that I am not a Dune fan, and I haven't read the book, nor will I read it one day. But I remember vividly playing a Dune PC game a long time ago, around the 90s, and how it was fantastic to allow the gamers to play each house. I've been playing the game as the Duke of Atreides and the Harkonnen's Baron, and the game's objective was simple: control Arrakis and crush the other houses. I ended up playing the game several days straight without going out of my room.	

And then I remember David Lynch's Dune, as I grew a bit older, and I thought the visualization was excellent, the characters were colorful. However, I was finding it a bit too caricatural for my liking. And I was confused following the storyline.

Fast forward, around 25 years later. 

As I grew more and more passionate about movies, storytelling, scriptwriting, and directing, I have my list of favorite films director. Sometimes, I need to see who the director of the film is before I see one.
Sicario was my first experience of Dennis' way of storytelling, and it was evoking, exciting, and in my own words, intimidating. But the one that swept me away was The Arrival. I love the story twist, the production value, the set design, and the build-up of the characters.

To cut a long story short, Dennis is now among the top film directors I guarantee will follow and watch his movies.

Would that make this review a bias one?

It's like you are reading a classic book, and everyone is raving about it.
Finally, after a long wait, you find a delightful long weekend, and you are planning to gobble it in one go. Such a page-turner! You can stop visualizing each scene, and you forget to eat, to take a bath, you immerse in it.

But then, life takes over, and at half of the book, you have no choice to put down that book.

This experience is how I feel about the movie.

Do I hate the book? No, of course not.
Will I look forward to finishing it? Hell, yes.
Will I share my experience with the people about the book? Well, perhaps. Maybe I will wait until I finish it.

Back to Dune, Part One, 2021.
I refrain from judging the film because I know it is not the ending. 

I genuinely enjoy the grand scale and how Dennis put effort into each character and their purposes in the story. 

The star-studded casts are also a treat to watch their performance on every scene.

Every aspect of design, set, architecture, spaceships, wardrobe, makeup, fantastic music score, and sound effect were excellent and looked well thought-through.

I can see Dennis's passion in every second of the film. And how every person (hundreds of names on the credit title) helped him make his visualization come through.

That's why in French, the word 'director' is translated as 'realisateur.'
And obviously, he is among the best.

Do I hate the film? No, of course not. I love it.
Will I wait for the second part of the story? Hell, yes!

I hope Warner Bros is smart enough to start the production of the other half of the story right away.

It is heartbreaking to discover Dennis willing to wait on how commercially successful the first half of the story will be, in order for him to get a green light and direct or make a reality of the second part of it.

I just can't wait to see part two. I know it will be fantastic.

4.5,"I really enjoyed how well they followed the plot and what changes they made to the story of dune to make it more understandable to the audience. They even made some use of the ""show don't tell"" method of storytelling, though they do occasionally ruin it by showing and then telling.
There are 3 questionable choices i would mention, and this will include minor spoilers.
Firstly, there is the fact that they changed the sex of Dr. Kynes. I question it because Kynes sex was an important way to setup the negative aspects of his character. He was a father that was never around, including at the birth of his own daughter. He was more devoted to his mission and to educating people than he ever was to his family. I think there are many other characters that could be changed, basically any of the court members of Paul Atreides could be gender swapped and it would lack that negative effect on the characterization. For some it might even add depth to their characters.
The second part is how spiritual and Fremen they made Kynes, this is because Kynes is kinda meant to stand somewhat apart from the Fremen in his/her specific role. She/He is meant to be a leader coming from the outside and adapting to their ways, while still definitely being an outsider.
The final thing is that towards the end of the movie they change how Leeto fights and why it looks like he is playing with his opponent. Originally Leeto dodges and defends at full speed, while slowing at the last moment on his attacks. This is because he is used to fighting with shields. They changed this to be about him never having taken a life. This makes Leeto more sympathetic to people, which may end up being a positive. But it does move it away from the original character, who was fairly hard to truly understand.

But all in all, if they keep this up, this will be a truly amazing series of movies and this first installment is breathtaking.",Mikkel L,False,False,True,False,4.5,"Oct 25, 2021",Mikkel L,/user/id/978579117,RT,978579117,

I loved this film, given it's 2.5hrs the pacing was good and it goes very quickly. Visually it's stunning and using practical affects rather than all CGI really adds to the world building, the different planets feel real. 
The music/score is not for everyone, it does go with the visuals but there is no real themes/soundtrack which in my opinion if there was would make this film 5 stars.
Acting and performances were all excellent, there wasn't a weak link.

4.0,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with this. Dune's been ... weird as a franchise. I think everyone knows the movie with Sting, which I suppose worked for its time. The miniseries at least gave things room to grow. Then there's this.

Even if you just like visuals, if you want to see concept art brought into a movie and not look out of place, look at this. It's gorgeous. The Baron looks great... yes, even when floating around. That's easy to make look silly or ""Meh,"" but this was an interesting and well executed bit of design and costuming.

All in all, I really, really liked this movie - so why the four stars instead of five? One thing. I saw it in theaters.

If you broke down the movie to the essential elements you'd find an exposition dump every ten minutes. Action scenes that are copy cats from modern action movies. Safe parameters with character development, commonly found in candy sucking movies. It's a sincere shame.

It’s not a super action-packed Star Wars or Marvel flick so if that’s what you’re looking for, this is not it. This movie is a dark, atmospheric, visual masterpiece that burns slow but keeps your attention the entire time. I always prefer movies that primarily convey things visually and keep the exposition to a minimum so i really enjoyed this. If i do have one complaint, it is that this movie kept the dialogue to such a minimal level that even someone like me would have preferred just a little more of the macro exposition and fleshing out of the characters. But in my opinion, it’s much better to be on the minimal side of exposition than the maximum side where i feel like my intelligence is being insulted.

1.0,"Having read the books, seen the David Lynch version countless times, watched the SciFi Channel mini Series, I must say this film was a complete let down.  I suffered through it to see what great new aspects and opportunities to showcase more of the background of the 'Herbertsphere' these novels were based on - but not a bean!

There is absolutely nothing new, the characters are weak, rushed and just don't fit the parts - atrocious acting and no feeling at all.  It's a total pigs ear of an affair and has done nothing to improve what was already there in the Lynch version, despite that being heavily cut.

There was missed opportunity (considering that part 2 was a given) to explore some of the concepts, the technology, the differences between the houses and to look at the air of mystery surrounding the Bene Gesserit sisterhood.  Charlotte Rampling could of been great had she been able to play up a bit more on the dark side.  They could of worked in things like why the Baron floated, what was all that black gunk the baron bathed in and all these nuances that will just not make any sense to newcomers.

Chalomet was a bit of a weedy character and not suited - he just could not carry the role convincingly, neither could Rebecca Ferguson.  Momoa seems to be cropping up everywhere in bit parts and is predictable - I just can't take him seriously.  Isaac was a bit plastic and brought nothing, unlike the original Jürgen Prochnow who was commanding and believable.  It would of been better having some unknowns who could act, rather than these frequent faces like Isaac who is in everything these days - and that's another problem that makes it not credible.  You can't watch this without the saturation of Momoa and Isaac in loads of recent films and that just ruins it.

So apart from weak characters, loads of missed opportunities, some wokeness thrown in for good measure and basically a painful re-hash of the Lynch film that was stretched out for 2½ hours, it was totally underwhelming film and I am not even going to bother with the second part.

The author Frank Herbert was not one for unadulterated happy endings and this movie is on track for the conclusion of mixed emotions in the presumed sequel which they simply have to make.

Not everyone will like it, and some may have trouble following it, but it is destined to be beloved by fans.

1.0,"There are only a handful of movies I have wanted to walk out on. This one was one of those. There are so many ways that this was a terrible movie that I will probably miss some. However, let me start by saying I read the Dune books before the original movie came out in 1984. I believe having that background caused me to not find anything about this movie to be novel or unique in its storyline, unlike my friend who was completely unfamiliar with Dune and Frank Herbert.

As to this movie, I questioned the casting of Timothee Chalamet from way back when it was announced. What a terrible casting job. The same could be said for Duncan Idaho's Jason Momoa, who does not have very strong acting chops. Vladamir and Raban Harkonnen are either poorly cast or suffer from such terrible dialogue that it just seems that way.

To that, the writing in this movie was ridiculous, and the dialogue was poorly delivered and/or directed. This entire movie lacked any genuine feel and seemed like actors reading lines. And the cinematography and music were WAY over the top! EVERY minute there was a big crescendo and some big landscape image that was supposed to give the movie some kind of epic feel. The problem was that this was CONSTANT and when that is the case, the movie lacks flow and contrast and ceases to be dynamic.

Lastly, they don't tell you up front that this movie is PART 1!!! So, the original movie, in 1984, complete with the vocabulary list they handed out in the theater, was perhaps 45 minutes too short at 2h 17m. This movie, at 2h 35m, was far too long for having covered up only up to the point that Paul and Jessica are embraced by the Fremen. They could have used that time to teach us more about the origin of the Mentats, or Dr. Yueh's Imperial Conditioning. We also did not get to meet Feyd-Rautha, played by Sting in the original. Assume they complete the original Dune movie in just two parts, and the second half is as long as part one. If that is the case, they will have used almost 3hrs more to tell the same story as was told in 1984, but with no additional story, plot, or character development.

This movie was a huge disappointment, and the scores I've seen are equally shocking. I can only guess that most of those high scores are from those unfamiliar with Dune and that find the body shields, ornithopters, and Frank Herbert other ideas as new and refreshing.",Adam P,False,False,False,False,1.0,"Oct 25, 2021",Adam P,/user/id/972195553,RT,972195553,

5.0,"I saw Dune at home last night and I haven't stopped thinking about it. The film was stunning right from the beginning, and I wanted to offer support to the risks Villeneuve took in this type of storytelling. He gave this story a vast space in which he allowed it to simply exist, and allowed the audience to experience a future unlike anything I've ever seen. At times it truly felt like a vision of a world that is so far beyond my imagination that I could barely fathom what was going on and I loved it. I felt like an ape seeing New York City for the first time - amazed, scared, confused, unable to take my eyes off it.

Hollywood filmmaking has so many conventional ideas about how to tell stories that get recycled over and over in predictable ways. They use an array of tropes to lead viewers by the hand from place to place so that the story is mostly obvious. It makes movies digestable to a mass market audience, but it just feels dull to me. It's like watching random movies from the 50's that all have the same generic sense of drama and follow the same general story beats.

Dune seemed to eschew all of this. It treats the audience like Paul himself - thrown into a dangerous story that's already in motion, scraping bits of comprehension where it can be found, struggling to grasp everything that's unfolding. You don't necessarily know who every single person is, or what every single piece of technology is doing, or where every faction comes from or exactly how they interact. I adore this type of world building, it's like you're dropped into a lived-in world that really exists and wasn't just conjured up like an amuseument park for your satisfaction.

The visual storytelling was unparalleled. The movie just radiates mood and style and it contributes to a feeling of... otherness? I almost lack a word for this, it's like this distant future that has a distinct feeling about it in the same way as you might get from immersing yourself in the medieval section of a museum. Their social mores, their aesthetic, their way of communicating, their beliefs, they're all so far removed from modernness that the mood itself becomes a setting. I didn't need to be told what every little thing was to have an instinctive feeling about it. All of their peculiar technology, the abilities of the Bene Gesserit, the motives driving each character and faction - it all seemed to be calculated in a perfect way so that I could get enough understanding to not be totally lost.

I know that many book readers are undoubtedly disappointed to see bits they loved not included. I know that feeling from other films / series where I have read the books. Yet, a film is a film. It isn't - can't be - the novel. It's more of a shadow cast by it. Villeneuve made a film that felt overwhelmingly Shakespearean to me. It was the story of a young scion of a great family that was led to their demise by betrayal serving the megalomania of a paranoid ruler, leading him to a destiny he was forced into. That's the essence of what I got from it, and I loved how classic and simple it is at the core of this turbulent world you're thrown into. It was like a raft I could cling to in a narrative sea that wanted to drown me everywhere I looked, and allowed me to appreciate the weird majesty of it all.

Look, I know I'm being a bit overly flowery in my praise of this movie, but it was a profoundly awesome experience. The sound design was superb, the concepts unfurled with this perfect balance of mystery and explanation, the journey was incredibly memorable. I thought it was perhaps one of the best setups of a story I've ever seen. It got me completely hooked and invested in the next film.

I completely understand why many others will find this ""boring"" or ""slow"" or otherwise falling short of some arbitrary mark they set themselves, but I appreciate this movie for what it is. It's a singular vision that I will always remember, like Star Wars A New Hope or 2001 A Space Odyssey. The '84 Dune was interesting in its own regard, but this was in an entirely different galaxy of achievement in my eyes.

3.0,"Spoilers.  It's difficult to spoil a book published 56 years ago that spawned a previous movie and at least two cable TV miniseries, but I want to be fair to first-time watchers unaware of ""Dune"".

In no particular order...

The Bad:
- The mother's character (Lady Jessica) is made WAAAAY too sympathetic for the audience. She was selfish and power-hungry.
-- She defied her order of witches (the Bene Gesserit) by giving birth to a son.
-- She only gave birth to a son to ensure it was HER bloodline to fulfill the prophecy of the first male witch of the order.
-- Since she was only a concubine of Duke Atredies, she also wanted her bloodline to reign. We get NONE of this from the movie.
- ""What's so special about The Spice (Mélange)"" did I hear you ask?  Hell if you know because there was ZERO made clear about its importance in the movie.
-- The Spice allows instantaneous travel across the universe by folding space; an important detail not emphasized or well-explained.
-- The Spice ONLY exists on Arrakis
- The potency of royal and political intrigue was watered down to insignificance.
- A musical score and can make or break a movie.  This score broke the movie.  There are no memorable music cues, thus making this movie unworthy of seeing as a theater experience.
- Baron Harkonnen (played by Skarsgård) is portrayed as a mean, fat guy.  The character was a sadistic deviant of the highest order, but we're given an angry guy who floats around and eats a lot.  This was an immense missed opportunity.
- Lack of emphasis on what's so special about Lady Jessica's and Paul's fighting abilities; it's important to the plot and yet is not conveyed.
- The movie is essentially ‘to be continued' yet I feel no excitement to see what follows because of my aforementioned analysis. This is a 2.5 hour experience and everything I've mentioned and more could EASILY have been contained and conveyed in that time span.

The Good:
- Cinematography is about as good as it gets. There are masters of their craft at the helm and it shows.
-- Lighting 
-- Overall atmosphere 

- Good special effects.
-- Some well-thoughtout concepts with aircraft, for example, that must operate in a sandy, desert environment.

- Costumes were hit or miss, but I'll place this under ‘good' because it was mostly hit.
-- Military armor was adequate
-- Freemen still suits were good
-- Other costumes bland, but made a minor statement.

I am not one of those folks who will say, ""It's not as good as the book.""  It can never be nor should it be so.  To bring a book from a written medium to a visual one means changes have to be made.  The two mediums communicate their messages using different languages.  And I'm okay with that.

5.0,"I surely hope the greenlighting of Dune Part Two is not based entirely on box office numbers - especially since Warner Bros foolishly decided to release Part One both in theaters and via HBO Max. We opted to see it in the theater (then again the next day on HBO Max), and I can tell you the experience in the theater VASTLY outweighed watching it at home on TV. Nobody's reading this particular review… but jut in case you are, please go see Dune in the theater. We're seriously considering going back to the theater just for the experience (and to hear the Sardukar throat singing in Dolby surround sound, which is about as frighting/interesting as the ""Annihilation music"").

The movie itself is brilliant. Dune and No Time To Die are pretty much a tie for the 2021 Immersion Award - I found myself getting lost within both pictures. You feel like you're a part of the story. Dune's world building is so much grander than the 1984 version - and considering this movie spent 2 hours and 35 minutes to tell about the first 1 hour and 8 minutes worth of the 1984 version, there's a lot more room for everyone to move around. Every scene propels the story forward, naturally and deliberately. It is a Sci-fi story though, so you might have thoughts like, ""Well why aren't spice Melange harvesters built so they can fly away and not have to wait for distant carry-alls to rescue them from imminent worm digestion?"" To that I might say, ""It's a movie, shut the fuck up."" Or ""Maybe that's just the equipment they had since they were left with really lousy equipment."" In fact, I like both responses.

I haven't seen ""The French Dispatch"" yet (that's tomorrow's movie), but so far, Dune boasts the best casting for a movie in 2021. I'm not very familiar with Timothée Chalamet's previous work, but he was born to play Paul Atreides. Zendaya makes a stellar Chani (from the little screen time we get of her in Pt. 1). I can't imagine a better choice for Gurney Halleck than Josh Brolin - he's perfect. I've never given much thought to the character of Stilgar until I watched Javier Bardem fill his stillsuit - holy crap, what a presence! Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Jason Momoa, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Chen Chang, Charlotte Rampling, David Dastmalchian and Babs Olusanmokun are all fantastic in their roles and were expertly cast. Shit, even Charlie Rawes (who I recognized as the jealous, scary and huge Londoner who chases Coach Beard all over Season 2, Episode 9 of ""Ted Lasso"") was great in his brief yet violent scene as a Harkonnen jerk. The only questionable role was Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban. He has acting chops. I've seen them in Guardians movies, Spectre (where he said only one word) and especially in Blade Runner 2049. The understated sadness of his Sapper punctuated by the character's brutality really set the tone for that movie and I wish we had gotten more of that Bautista than what we got in Dune.

The ships are inventive, the battles are intense, the fighting is other-worldly, and the political intrigue is fascinating.

Get past how Harkonnen is pronounced and that Dr Liet-Kynes is not a white guy but a black woman. Gone are Irulan's cold dead narration, the ridiculous internal thoughts and monologues of each character, and weirding modules that use sound as a weapon from the 1984 Lynch version. This Dune is a serious movie and it finally lives up to the source material.

I look forward to meeting Princess Irulan, Padishah Emporer Shaddam IV, Alia Atreides and especially Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in Part Two. I also look forward to certain parentages, revelations and events sure to come in Part Two. I cannot believe the second part hasn't even been greenlit yet. Hurry up with that, Warner Bros.

4.5,"Dune is a spectacular film with stunning visuals and a story that hardly ever gets lost in its 150-minute runtime. What makes this film so great is how clear the story is. Many epics have very complicated stories with overcrowding of heterogeneous elements that hinder the viewing experience. Yet, Dune has these complex underlying tones, which never make the narrative structure feel cluttered. Screenwriters Jon Spaihts, Denis Villeneuve, and Eric Roth do a remarkable job creating the world of Dune through some stellar writing. The trio also made the film end at the right place in the story. It leaves enough adventure for the second film and does not leave the story in the first installment in a weird position. The visuals in Dune are breathtaking. The film achieves this visual status that creates this miraculous vibe throughout the whole duration of the movie. Director of photography Greig Fraser deserves several more movies after his work here. As of now, Fraser only has The Batman in the future. That is guaranteed to change after his cinematography on Dune. Denis Villeneuve is a solid director and was the right choice for a film like this. Villeneuve creates this tone that is grand and dramatic yet still lighthearted at times. The cast of Dune is one of the most influential highlights of the movie, as no actor tarnishes the film. Timothée Chalamet is phenomenal in the leading role. Not once did his acting appear dry or emotionless. Rebecca Ferguson was stellar as Lady Jessica. The emotion she packed into her performance was so well done. Oscar Isaac was quite monotone throughout his performance, but he never brought down any scene where it distracted from what was happening in the plot. Josh Brolin had a lot of excellent line delivery and was very strong when saying relevant lines. For instance, there is a line where Gurney Halleck talks about mood, and Brolin delivers it perfectly. Sharon Duncan-Brewster was very strong in the role of Dr. Liet-Kynes. While her character in the film did not end up in a great position, Duncan-Brewster made all the scenes she was in a lot more interesting. Stellan Skarsgård was also particularly strong even with all the prosthetics on his face. Acting in prosthetics is hard, but Skarsgård did not disappoint. Jason Momoa added some character to a lot of the scenes as many were very melancholy. Momoa and Chalamet were both great standouts when making the film still feel joyous at times. Lastly, Javier Bardem and Zendaya made such strong impressions in the few scenes they are present. The editing is the only aspect of the movie that I would say is hindering Dune. There are a few scenes where the editing is a bit choppy, and sometimes the flow between sequences is not perfect. However, the score from Hans Zimmer is strong. ""Paul's Dream"" is comprehensive as it helps set the mood for Arrakis. However, a minor nitpick with the score would be that some tracks needed more consistency so the whole soundtrack would connect. Dune is a phenomenal film that consists of show-stopping visuals and a marvelous cast. With Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson taking the reins of much of the movie, there is no way the film gets boring or dragged out. While there are trivial things like the editing and minor explanation problems, Dune hides those aspects with its impressive cinematography. Dune faithfully lives up to the epic nature that it promises.

5.0,"Dreams are messages from the deep.

Just let the small negatives out of the way first. Some parts were a bit slow, and characters murmured a lot so I couldn't hear some lines. Also it's quite a bit of info into the universe.

Now that's done, I first want to say that Dune: Part I was a cinematic masterpiece. Almost every single scene was handled masterfully with cinematography that blessed my eyes. Never have I seen the desert this beautiful and dreamy. It was so breathtaking that I might suffocate. 

Not only that, the unbelievable scores from Hans Zimmer created an immersive atmosphere. I have been listening to Paul's Dream and Ripples in the Sand for about 3 months now, and I just could not get tired of them. They sounded just as good, and even better in the theater. 

The characters looked amazing as well. The suits that Oscar Isaac and Timothee Chamalet wore were so classy, as well as the other designs. There were an absurd amount of close ups of characters' face, and each one of them was beautiful, especially the Fremen with their blue eyes.

Since this was only part I, the plot wasn't complete, but it showed great potential for an action-packed ""cinematic party"" - as said by Denis Villeneuve. 

Overall, probably the best looking film I have seen in a long long time. Please watch it in IMAX (the IMAX that I watched in was a bit ghetto) to absorb all the beauty. 9.5/10",Nguyen D,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 25, 2021",Nguyen D,/user/id/977479849,RT,977479849,

2.5,"⊃∪∩⪽ - 2021 (Action, Adventure, Drama)
PG-13 - 2.5 out of 5 stars

""Dune"" has long been considered an ""unfilmable"" work, and honestly, after watching this, I may have to agree. To be fair, I've never seen the 1984 version by David Lynch (although I do own it, so I need to get on that.) Previously the film was in preproduction by the director Alejandro Jodorowsky; this was such an infamous achievement that an entire documentary has been made just on the work he had put into a film that was never made.

In the lead-up to this new version, many comparisons to ""Star Wars"" have been made in the marketing. As far as I can tell, the closest to ""Star Wars"" that this comes is that it's in space, has aliens, and involves ""spice."" Other than that, this is very much a creature of its own and a derivative work at that. Director Denis Villeneuve (""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Sicario) built this world packed full of many compelling images and yet, in my opinion, forgot to include any substance. I feel like part of this could be since he spends most of the two hours and thirty-five-minute runtime building these worlds. I get the importance of this, but in a film that is the first of a proposed trilogy of films, he has to remember that hooking the audience is more critical than creating another world in the future.

I gave this a 2.5/5 because that's where I felt after the film, I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. I left feeling that I was in the middle of the road without much understanding of where to go from there. I will still watch the following two films because I feel invested. However, I doubt I'll fall for Villeneuve's marketing the next time. He was quoted as saying, ""Watching ‘Dune' on a TV is like driving a ‘speedboat in your bathtub'"" I'm a huge fan of movie theaters, and while this did offer some spectacular visuals, I don't feel that it was as important as I thought to watch it on the big screen. I'm not saying you shouldn't, but I also don't think most will appreciate it to that extent.

Overall, I'd say the film had a great score, vast and impressive set pieces, a lot of filler, and little substance. It is a 2 hour and 35-minute film that felt all four hours while watching it. So as you can see, I was left not being sure how to best rate it. My experience wasn't the greatest, but I can see the potential and am excited at the thought of what this universe can be. 

As always, please don't take my word for it. I only share my feelings and thoughts on these films. If you love something that I hated, then your opinion on it is valid. If you hated a movie I loved, again, you are entitled to that opinion. I've said it before, and I'll repeat it, my favorite part of film is that two people can watch it and have two entirely different experiences.

For the fun of it, I rewatched Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"" as part of my project watching all of the films set in the Alien/Predator universe (yes, Blade Runner is there, check out my social media to find out how.) I adore this film; it had so much heart and just the right amount of nostalgia from the original ""Blade Runner"" film.

I'm very much looking forward to ""Last Night in Soho,"" although I feel that it may not be able to live up to what I've built it up in my mind.

4.0,"Loved it. Villaneuve's genius continues to be his pacing, not just his incredible ability to invent new soundscapes, worlds and people for us to be immersed in, which we all know he's very gifted at. His genius at dancing back and forth between showing & telling at EXACTLY the right moments keeps the viewer engrossed, then appropriately perplexed, then there's a satisfying revelation or tease towards one, then you're engrossed again, and around we go. This is masterful direction at its finest. I was fully ready to hunker down for another 3 hours when the credits rolled. 

Another thing he did— and did better than almost anyone else I can think of in the last 20 years — is he led us WITH the would-be messianic figure in his gradual self-awakening rather than pacing us ahead of him as the viewer. That's very very hard to do. I hate to be too on the nose, but Villaneuve was nearly Shakespearian in his invocation of an apprehensive hero that the audience joins in his apprehension and self-doubt. This is no Neo wherein we're all winking at each other in wait (no offense to one of my favorite sci-fi movies). Even those who know what will happen & know Paul's fate will be paced alongside Paul's understated disbelief and reservations as he becomes more and more self-aware. To be honest even at the end of the film I still wondered what he thought of himself— and that's great filmmaking.

The cinematography is gorgeous, the designs I'll have a quality that is both familiar and foreign at the same time, the acting from everyone onscreen is great, and Hans Zimmer‘s score is just as engrossing as it always is.
It's just that almost everything I expected to be bad about the film, was just as bad as I thought it would be. The pacing is way too slow at times, as charming as the actors were, the characters that they were portraying were bland as hell, and it tricked the audience within the first minute of the film! Surprising them with the knowledge that this was a part one, instantly setting their expectations lower, knowing they'd only see (at least) half of a story!
It's still a good film overall, don't get me wrong, but it's not perfect and I don't think it's the masterpiece that most fans of the original book are anticipating it to be.

This movie, in being remade, deserved to be made in an epic scope and fashion.  I believe this has been accomplished and I was completely immersed in the tale.  Even after having read the books (albeit many years ago) and watched the original several times.  The actors portrayal of the characters was excellent bringing new scope and completeness to each of the main roles.  The cinematography is outstanding!  I really enjoyed the film.  I would say that I loved it but since there is a part two in the future I feel as if I've had an excellent first date and I can see myself falling in love after a little more time together.

It took the edgy dark house Harkonen from the earlier film and book source material and gave it a reasonable if not militant bent. House Atriedes was the more noble house given to exploration for the purpose of installing a livable system for all, I would assume was supposed to parallel many civilized settled citizenry. Then there was house Ordos, which to be honest I did not see represented much in this part one treatment of the story. Admittedly, I'm no expert of the Dune lore. Yet I left the cinema wanting more and loving what I got. It has been a long time since I have been honestly excited for a story. Sure, Godzilla vs king Kong was a cinematic smashfest that I loved. It tapped into the 8 year old boy inside of me. Dune only the flip side left me exhausted, overheated, and longing for the ""rest of the story"" as Paul Harvey used to say.

3.5,"I am not sure about Dune. It is a visual treat from Villeneuve, first and foremost. It is also long and quite clearly concealing its cards closest to its chest and saving better things for the sequels. With no real knowledge of the source material, the plot has few major problems, if any. It can afford to have lulls due to the project's scope and the necessity of the audience to bed into the film's world. Hans Zimmer, undertaking a score that he felt a close personal connection to per his own words and a composer who I would put among the best working today, did not always do it for me. Some of the bombastic sound effects, although certainly otherworldly and unique, distracted from events and camera shots in a strange disconnect nearly tumbling proceedings onto the concerning edge of ridiculous. I liked the performances. Chalamet and Ferguson don't exactly work as mother and son, but both of them are good if lacking a few real standout moments as the two characters with the most time to shine. Oscar Isaac is typically splendid, and I would say that Stellen Skarsgard's character is perfectly realised and suitably blood-curdling. A lot of well-known actors are also in this and as one would surmise, I had few complaints.

5.0,"Simply astonishing. ""Dune"" visualizes and evokes a sublime and thoughtful story in a fully-realized universe. The characters are portrayed beautifully and some, even better than they were on the page—I'm looking at you Timothee Chalamet. Everybody played their roles to perfection: Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica was interesting and 3 dimensional. Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho was a charismatic and loveable soldier. Oscar Isaac as The Duke was staunch and conservative. Stellan Skarsgaard as the Barron was terrifying and glutinous. I think you get the point that everyone was perfectly cast.

The score was one to remember. Arguably the best Hanz Zimmer has ever crafted. Sometimes its bombastic and epic. In others it's strange and eerie. But it always hold a sense of gravitous that is not easily conjured. 

Did I mention the special effects were out of this world? Dennis had a vision, and the cinematographers, costume designers and visual effects crew were in on it too. Dune has been referred to as the unfilmmable sci-fi epic—Dennis and crew wanted to change that and they did. 

Some will say that the endpoint didn't feel like an actual ending but more of an intermission for the sequel, and while I understand where they're coming from, I believe the writers and Dennis did the best they could to end part 1 how they thought it should've ended. 

This is a masterpiece, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is the science fiction epic of a life time—not Star Wars. This will be a movie that we talk about and reference to for years to come.

4.0,"Although a bit tedious at times Dune is well worth a watch. The cinematography and score drive the film, as it is visually stunning and foreboding. The film's biggest downfall is that it's meant to be told in two parts. Without a confirmed sequel, it leaves the viewer with a story (books aside) left open ended. Far be it from me to discount the cinema but I opted to view the film on HBO MAX. In my opinion, the film would've been far less enjoyable in theatres.

3.5,"Majestic and visually stunning, the film does well in capturing the mood and subtleties of the Dune universe, but the middling scripting and uneven acting detract from what will define this new legacy meant to erase the memory of the David Lynch debacle. Admittedly, I was hoping for something more along the lines of Game of Thrones, with a high language in harmony with Frank Herbert's social commentary and exposition of political subterfuge. The beautifully crafted visuals, gritty cityscapes and intricate machinery of the Dune world set upon a poignant Hans Zimmer sound track, at least make up significant ground lost by the poor writing.

The screenplay uses Herbert's eloquence sparingly and effectively, but for those who know the novel, it is glaringly clear when additional dialogue or narrative voice overs are interjected to fill the in-between spaces with Hollywood filler. The film is a reminder that poorly read millennials will speak for the future of 10,000 AD, creating such jarring colloquialisms as when the protagonist Paul asks his mother Jessica, before entering into the desert surf, ""You good,"" forgetting to add ""dude"" to the end of the sentence. Then as they emerge from the storm, Jessica, a high courtier to the Duke Leto exclaims, ""That was insane!"" also forgetting to add ""dude."" Many moments leave us wishing that things were just left unsaid, for example when Paul explains, ""It's all your fault. I am a freak."" We get it and you don't need to belabor the point, Rick James.

Given the weakness of the writing, the director wisely chooses to let the visuals do the heavy lifting, but this strains Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson to use their screen presence to carry the gravitas of the film they are not equipped to do, leading to over acting at key points—e.g Jessica's half smile when told Paul could be the Kwisatz Haderach, confusing the audience for a second as to whether she is an eminent member of the Bene Gesserit with intricate self-control over their emotional presence, or a freshman who just found out she was selected to the sorority of her choice after a long rush week. 

The producers insightfully chose scenes well suited to the screen and limited the film to covering only the first third of the novel, avoiding the challenges that David Lynch faced in trying to tell the whole story at once. Converting the first Dune novel into a multipart series provides more breathing room (and profitability) similar to how Pierce Brown retracted the movie rights to Red Rising, in favor of a more thoughtfully developed television series. Yet the pacing of the film is too slow, not because of the limited material, but because the director chose to use voice overs to jump start the narrative, so more time could be spent on overly long shots of space ships flying around. Thoughtful dialog could have been paired with these scenes to develop the characters or push the narrative forward, but this was unfortunately absent for much of the film. 

Fans (and studio execs) need not worry that this will be an ignominious flop with the laughable pixilated body shields the 1984 Dune, but the film is far from being a revolution in cinema that Dune represented for science fiction.",Creighton D,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 24, 2021",Creighton D,/user/id/979306536,RT,979306536,

I really like the choices made by Villaneue, the producers, production design staff, costume designers, camera people, the editor, art direction. And of course the writing as well. It's certainly a world all its own they created on the screen, in my mind. 
Seems some critics expected something else, have not read the novel so they seem to not get why the tone and energy vibe of the movie is what it is. But it worked exceptionally well for me. 
Chalamet is one of the most fascinating actors working at the moment. I was excited when I first saw he would play the lead here, and he didn't disappoint; not that he has yet for me. Rebecca Ferguson is wonderful, too. She's a great presence, with palpable strength and skill as an actor. Oscar Isaac was made for this role, conveying the sense of father, husband and leader with equal authenticity. Momoa continues to grow and improve. Also quite good are the always reliable Stellan Skarsgård, Duncan-Brewster, and Charlotte Rampling as a potent Reverend Mother- great choice there.

I felt like everything was given equal weight, characters and design. Costume designs for the different alien races was easy to distinguish, I liked the character of Paul Atriedes. I was excited to see heavy hitters like Stellan Skarsgard as The Baron, Jason Mamoa as Duncan Idaho, and Oscar Issac as The Duke, Leto Atriedes. Josh Brolin plays sort of a part that didn't have the impact for me I thought it could. I loved that the sand worms are only glimpses, and you don't see anything that gives away it's design.

2.0,"Frank Herberts 1965 sci-fi masterpiece is as intricately woven with complex relationships between characters as it is with lore and imagined physical detail.
Any undertaking to bring Frank Herberts Dune to film is a daunting undertaking.
David Lynch was barely able to pull it off with his 1984 attempt, even by standards of fans who had read the novel beforehand.
Denis Villeneuves much vaunted two part version of Dune, the third cinematic run at the sci-fi tome, dissipatedly falls flat on two counts.

The film, part one, begins with its first hour as a regurgitation of the Lynch version, almost verbatim and shot-by-shot in some instances.
This may not be a bad thing for those that have not seen the Lynch version or read the book.
As Villeneuves Dune plods on, it gets lost in the space between the complex lore of Herberts Dune universe and an attempt to be concise and approachable.
I cant help but imagine for someone that had not experienced any of the prior versions, that they would find it difficult to follow.
For me, someone that has experienced many of the prior versions, I found it half handed and uninteresting.

Many of the key characters performance in Dune are delivered two dimensionally.
New comer Timothe Chalamets delivery of Paul Atreides just cant seem to draw me into the galactic power and spiritual struggle that is beginning to unfold.
Even veteran bad guy actor Stellan Skarsgrds portrayal of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen falls flat.  Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, one of the most vial and corrupt characters in the history of sci-fi should repulse, mortify, outrage, anger.  Instead Villeneuve gives us a morbidly obese guy that cant support his own body weight and talks with his mouth full.
Josh Brolins roll as Gurney Halleck is reduced to merely more than a cameo.
Veterans Rebecca Ferguson and Benicio del Toro give solid performances and save the film.
Honorable mention for Jason Momoa as he makes the transition from super hero to super soldier.

Special effects are great, top shelf, of course, expect nothing less from a Villeneuve sci-fi film.
Shai-Hulud (Sand Worm) gives its greatest performance to date.

3.0,"The best cinematography of the DUNE efforts to date. Undecided on the screenplay. The angle of making it more of an emotive angst filled journey for Paul actually works somewhat when viewed solely as the story of Paul Attreides(At least so far). DUNE is a classic because of its depth. Much like LORD OF THE RINGS. And its nearly impossible to capture enough details of the story in 3 films much less 1 or 2. LOTR did very well in 3 (Though a bunch of great book content was lost/changed), and fans were satisfied with where movie 1 ended. So far, the politics and the character development of DUNE is nil in this version. But it is pretty, well acted with mostly very good acting choices. The limited action was well done(Clean shaven Jason Momoa particularly was impressive in his fight scenes). It will need to be finally judged when its sequel arrives.  I believe DUNE fans will find weakness. There simply isnt any depth for characters besides Paul, no introspection, no flashbacks to paint emotional pictures or make us care about them or their intentions. But big plot points are there, the scenery is grand and well presented. A slightly more visually horrific Baron would be nice, but we may see more of that in part 2. 3 stars is what it deserves so far because the plot point it ended on and the lack of chapter finality of that point leave this as more of an INCOMPLETE than a grade. But I do want to see how it plays out.  By Comparison, rewatching the 1984 version is almost painful now. David Lynch was always unconventional and it really made an already difficult and at times confusing story worse not better...plus Its visual effects needed to be these, but technology hadnt arrived yet and it shows. But Lynch made a movie nobody wants to see again, even to see if they like it more. This one, I do wanna see the sequel, so it has a chance to be the DUNE it sets out to be.

5.0,"A stunning movie!!  The visuals, attention to visual scale, lighting, technologies, languages, the techno-culture of the houses...all put together and crafted with meticulous attention to detail. There is so much visual detail that you can't catch the major visual items in one pass, you have to watch this a few times from different angles.  One of my biggest pet peeves in scifi movies is a lack of actual scientific attention to non-terrestrial detail (i.e. Cameron's Na'vi speaks in essentially an earth-based aboriginal style which, which makes me groan whenever I hear it spoken in the Avatar movie).  The various languages devised in Dune (both spoken and non-spoken) were built to illustrate a better understanding of what non-terrestrial languages might sound-like, or look-like (i.e., the introduction of the Sardaukar Shock Troops is a great example of this in action).  Dune does an amazing job at keeping it smart even down to the smallest of details (e.g., the moisture efficient desert mouse).

This isn't a slow movie (I mean, Gandhi (1982), that was a slow movie), it moves at a perfect pace (read the books and you will realize this was crafted with care).  Of course if you want super speed in the movie runtime, then go watch Star Wars! :-) Another chief complaint I have about many high-concept sci-fi movies, to much talking with grade school dialogue, movies need to spend more time to visually explain what is occurring, and Dune does this extremely well.

We watched it in a 3D format and the whole family came along and all of us walked out of that theater blown away from end to end (including the highly connected 14 year old, had his attention all the way through).

I expected much from Denis Villeneuve - and I did get that.  The problem is that it's not the much I was looking for.  I think this film wants to not be the 1984 film so much that it constrains itself in the acting and story.

The actors (apart from Jason Momoa - who shines in this) spend so much of their time brooding that you cant tell them apart.  Its only when the dialogue diverges from the book where one actually sees a glimmer of character.   It's like the lines are being recited rather than acted - competent, but lacking depth.

While the film struggles a bit with its pacing, (I believe) its writing, and the casting for a few secondary roles, it will certainly please both fans and initiated - an even more impossible task. The adaptation of the most cerebral aspects of the books is in my opinion perfectly balanced for the big screen - it is still present, but doesn't get heavy at all. While as a fan I could have used more of it, I understand these choices which were probably made to please wider audiences thus increasing the chances to see a Part Two - but it stayed loyal to the books. All the strangeness and mystical mood is very well rendered too - through visions, through the incredible sound track, stunning and trippy (at places) visuals, and acting. I feel that this is as faithful to the books as it can be! Well except maybe a tad short even for half a story. It could have used another half hour of runtime, I would have loved to see the banquet with characters reading and political play, and also I would have loved to see more of Liet Kynes - or Dr Kynes - with deeper explanations of Arrakis's ecology and her plan for it.

The eventual importance of the Shield Wall in the final battle for Arrakis is also foreshadowed - at least for those who have read the book.

3.5,"Things I Like:
- The visuals are spectacular. The world is so imaginative, futuristic, chic, and avant-garde in the classic, quasi-dystopian style that Villeneuve used for Blade Runner 2048. I particularly enjoyed the 1) floating light 2) spaceships 3) all the costumes 4) Duke's palace 5) suits
- Hans Zimmer's score is epic
- The cast is loaded here with Chalamet, Zandaya, Momoa, Isaac, Bardem, Brolin, etc... The fact that so many get killed off mid-movie is quiet the flex from Villeneuve.
- Stellan Skarsgard stolen every scene as Vladimir Harkonnen
- The use of mystery (re: JJ Abrams' TED talk about the black box) - hiding the full worm or how Vladimir Harkonnen floats everywhere adds a layer of intrigue to everything
- Aesthetically and sonically, this movie feels built to my tastes 

Hmmmm:
- I don't think this movie works as a stand lone film. It feels incomplete. While I'm not a screenwriter, I think a more satisfaction conclusion might have seen the siege on the palace occur in act three where Paul and Jessica narrowly escape. That way, it ends on a high note of them surviving but offers plenty of room to explore the rest of the planet and the Fremen society.
- The use of dreams and visions did not do it for me. With one exception, everything in the visions came true, making the film feel predictable, even for someone who hasn't read the book.
- Perhaps for the reasons I listened above, but this film had no emotion impact for me. I wanted it too. I wanted to love this movie. That said, I was more captivated by the technical accomplishments than any emotional resonance of the plot. 

Verdict:
This gets a strong 7 and, as of this review, the best movie I have seen in 2021. It should rake the technical awards at the Oscars and has the potential to become the next Star Wars",Karl R,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 24, 2021",Karl R,/user/id/800281010,RT,800281010,

Taking a deep dive at once might be a path fettered with hurdles, but once those names of who's who is set in stone in your mind within the first half an hour, the rest of the film is a pleasure ride for cinema lovers. It ticks all the right boxes in departments, such as set design, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, make-up, sound, and most importantly the music which is Hans Zimmer at his best. The story which is essentially to be concluded in the sequel throws light onto the protagonist's evolution from a prince to a Duke in exile, on the lookout for vengeance, justice, and reclamation of what's lost, to restore the order that his kingdom aspired to establish in the planet Arakis. It is a bildungsroman and Timothee evolves with every scene he is in. Frankly, he is revelation once again.

4.5,"Dune is one of those select films that will live on to define a generation. It will join the ranks of films like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Blade Runner: all films that bring people together, all incredible testaments to the power of film not only as a medium but as a cultural force.
Dune is an adaptation with the end goal of bringing Herberts text to life, rather than explaining it. It has a great deal of respect for its source material, far more so than the majority of adaptations made today. This respect can be seen literally all around the board each and every tool is used to immerse you in the story.
From a visual (and scale, the two are nearly one and the same) standpoint, the film is flawless. Every image is visceral, powerful, and jaw-dropping. The sense of pure size it creates is one seldom found in film anymore (others that come to mind are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, 2001: ASO, The Prince of Egypt, etc.). It truly pays homage not only to the books descriptive language but a bygone era of a fuller cinema. The images strike you with potent colors and framing it invokes a larger-than-life feeling.
I dont have much to say on a personal level- I have virtually no complaints. While I prefer Arrival for its emotional value, Dune is certainly a worthy contender for Villeneuves best film. Im docking a few points for some minor expository aspects where I think the book really shines aside from that, theres nothing I can say against this film. I know Ill be rewatching it over and over again, each time wishing it were the first.

3.5,"Saw the movie in Imax, Saturday 23 October.  Theater was about half full - pretty good given the pandemic, I guess.

So look - I'm that guy who read the book for the first time when I was 15 years old (I'm 60 now) and have read it at least 10 times since. It really is my favorite work of fiction, ever. And I know that I am not alone - Dune is that kind of book.

I loathed the 1984 attempt - it was insulting to the source material, no other way to say it. As a result, I was very skeptical about the 2021 effort.  THAT SAID, Denis Villeneuve is a fantastic director and, after being proved wrong about LoTR (which I thought would NEVER work on screen) I gave it a try.  

The movie, as you know, only covers the first half of the book... and rather rushes it at that.  As I watched, I kept thinking ""man, if you didn't read the book this would make ZERO sense!"" but since I did read the book, stuff fit. I do wish Denis had found  a way to explain a few things (like the lack of Computers, which is serious theme in the book) and maybe touch on the other houses of the Landsraad and how they were part of the story... but I know - a single movie is a small space for all that deeper stuff.  If you haven't read the book, it is FULL of internal dialogue and every chapter starts with an excerpt of a historical document that references what what is going on.  Add to that, the book has multiple appendices that really fleshes things out. Maybe there'll be a ""directors cut"" that lasts 4 hours - who knows?

So all that said, the visuals were *great* - I particularly liked how the Ornithopters were portrayed - VERY believable; The casting was... *good* - and while I really didn't like Tim Chalamet at first, he grew on me in the role.  My big problem was Rebecca Ferguson as the Lady Jessica.  In the book, Jessica is *hard* woman - tough as hell, very reserved and strong - not the weepy mommy we see in the movie. She bugged me.  Jason Issacs crushes it as the Duke Leto (but he kind of crushes everything he does) and even Jason Mamoa was quite good as the great Duncan Idaho.  I really hope that we see this turn into an entire series of movies - a franchies - so we'd see him again (In Dune Messiah).  Zendaya as Chani was... Fine. She didn't get much screen time and would play a far bigger part in part two, no doubt, but she neither thrilled nor repelled me. I'm not a big fan of ""pop stars as actors"" so forgive me for not loving her.  

YES - it ends abruptly. YES - it skips over a pile of things that might confuse the snot out of you.  If you really want to enjoy the movie, either read the book (which is huge but certainly worth it) or find any number of ""cliff's notes"" on the internet to understand a few important things: The Holzman Effect, the Bultlerian Jihad, what a Suk doctor is and what a Mentat is.  All of that would help understand some of the more confusing bits.

4.5,"In 10191 A.G., Duke Leto I (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and the only source of melange, or ""spice"", a priceless substance that extends human vitality and is critical for interstellar travel. House Atreides are to replace the House Harkonnen, who have withdrawn from Arrakis on Shaddam's orders. In reality, seeing House Atreides as a threat to his own power, Shaddam intends to use his Sardaukar troops to eradicate House Atreides and stage a coup to allow House Harkonnen to re-take the planet shortly after their arrival. Leto is apprehensive of the assignment, but sees it as an opportunity to bond with Arrakis' native population, the Fremen, as a first step to bring peace throughout all the Houses. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusive sisterhood who wield advanced physical and mental abilities. Jessica was instructed to bear a daughter as part of the Gesserit's breeding program to create the Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic superbeing, but for her love for Leto she bore a son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in Bene Gesserit disciplines. Beginning before House Atreides' arrival on Arrakis, Paul is troubled by visions of a mysterious girl and a future where he leads a violent 'holy war', sharing his dreams only with Jessica and Duncan. Because of these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam comes to Caladan and subjects Paul to the gom jabbar, a deadly test to assess its subject's humanity, which he passes. Afterwards, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to spare Paul and Jessica during his forthcoming coup, which he deceitfully agrees to. Leto, Jessica and Paul travel to Arrakeen, the stronghold on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Awaiting them are Idaho and a scouting party, having arrived on the planet in advance to learn and live among the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist Dr. Liet-Kynes, learning of the dangers involved in harvesting spice, particularly the giant sandworms that travel under the desert. During a flight with Paul, Halleck, and Kynes, they witness a sandworm attack an active harvester. Leto helps rescue its crew before the sandworm swallows it, during which Paul inhales the spice-laden air, causing his visions to intensify...

Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation."" Following its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, reception was generally positive but did not resonate with some critics. Summarizing early reviews, Stephen M. Colbert of Screen Rant noted that its complex story and Villeneuve's directorial style were bound to have selective appeal, and that this is reflected in negative reviews thus far. The film has been praised for its scope and ambition. Ben Travis of Empire magazine gave the film five out of five stars and stated, ""An absorbing, awe-inspiringly huge adaptation of (half of) Frank Herbert's novel that will wow existing acolytes, and get newcomers hooked on its Spice-fuelled visions. If Part Two never happens, it'll be a travesty."" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph also gave the film a five-star rating, calling it ""majestic, unsettling and enveloping"". Xan Brooks of The Guardian referred to the film in his five-star review as ""dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse"". In a positive review, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Villeneuve draws you into an astonishingly vivid, sometimes plausibly unnerving vision of the future."" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the film a B, wrote that Dune ""is exactly the kind of lush, lofty filmmaking wide screens were made for; a sensory experience so opulent and overwhelming it begs to be seen big, or not at all"" and added, ""The sheer awesomeness of Villeneuve's execution ... often obscures the fact that the plot is mostly prologue: a sprawling origin story with no fixed beginning or end."" Other critics commented on issues related to pacing and handling of the source material. Critic Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: ""It's an act of world-building that runs out of storytelling steam ... Dune is out to wow us, and sometimes succeeds, but it also wants to get under your skin like a hypnotically toxic mosquito ... as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous."" Kevin Maher of The Times gave two out of five stars, stating that while ""every frame ... is spectacular"", ""Dune is also kind of boring"". Reviewing the film for TheWrap, Steve Pond called the film ""both dazzling and frustrating, often spectacular and often slow"" and said, ""This version of Dune sometimes feels as if it aims to impress you more than entertain you; it's grim on a staggering level, ditching most of the fun of sci-fi yarns in favor of a worldview that feels more like Villeneuve's Sicario or Prisoners than his Arrival.""

So finally we have Denis Villeneuve´s ""Dune"" (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) here after having been pushed back a year. It is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, primarily covering the first half of the book.  The film stars an ensemble cast including Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem. Dune has been considered an ""unfilmable"" work due to its breadth and complexity of plots, and prior attempts, such as David Lynch's 1984 film, did not perform well with critics. Following a failed attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation of Herbert's novel, Legendary Entertainment acquired film and TV rights to the science fiction novel Dune in 2017. Development began shortly after, with Villeneuve expressing interest in the project and officially signing on as director in January 2017. He worked with Roth and Spaihts to write the screenplay, breaking it into two parts and incorporating an updated 21st century adaptation of the 1965 novel. Shortly after publication in 1965, Dune was identified for potential film prospects, and the rights to adapt the novel to film have been held by several producers since 1971. Multiple attempts to make such a film have been made, and it was considered to be ""unfilmable"", a difficult work to adapt to the screen owing to its breadth of content. Further, because of the book's status among passionate fans, any deviations from the original material without strong justification have the potential to harm the film's reputation. Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky had acquired the rights in the 1970s to make an extravagant fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project fell apart. This effort to make the film was later the subject of the documentary film Jodorowsky's Dune released in 2013. David Lynch's Dune, produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis in 1984, was intended to be a three-hour film, but was forced to be cut to 137 minutes for release, and as a result, the film was poorly received and considered a ""misfire"". A live-action miniseries, Frank Herbert's Dune, aired on the Sci Fi Channel in 2000; it did well in viewership, and was generally better received than Lynch's film. However, some reviewers criticized the miniseries for lacking the spectacle afforded to a feature film production, and for staying too faithful to the book and thus getting dragged down by exposition. Prospects to make a successful adaptation of Dune came after the critically-acclaimed adaptions of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both which maintained most of the works' key characters and plots while managing the limited running time. In 2008, Paramount Pictures were developing a new feature film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, with Peter Berg set to direct. Berg left the project in October 2009, with director Pierre Morel brought on to direct in January 2010, before Paramount dropped the project in March 2011 as they could not come to key agreements with their rights expiring back to Rubinstein. How is Villeneuve´s vision of ""DUNE"" then? I personally think that it´s a visual masterpiece that matches the book´s massive scope and universe with an excellent cast and magnificent cinematography and visuals. But, the first part misses the complexity of the book to my mind, this part is a bit too straightforward, but then again this is only part one. I do assume that Villeneuve will take us into those complex sections in part two. However, I would say that you need to have red Frank Herbert's ""DUNE"" to enjoy this adaptation fully as this film becomes the perfect complement to the book.

5.0,"Dune (A++)
Watching this in IMAX will always be something I will remember. The cinematography was outstanding in this film. The story may seem complex on the onset but this film does an impressive job of making it relatively digestible. This world is massive and the set up here was very detailed and well constructed. I haven't seen a film casted so well in a long time. Timothee Chalamet is a certified A lister for me now. The movie really has no flaws in terms of plot and storytelling. Even though the movie is long in length it doesn't make you lose interest and rather this length helps to provide a very solid foundation for sequels. That is my only complaint about this whole movie, that if there is no sequel this movie will feel like a massive 'what could have been"" film franchise. We need a sequel to this movie people. Please support it and watch it on the biggest screen possible. This movie was an unforgettable journey and a world I want to continue to explore. This franchise could be as elite as lord of the rings and star wars. It may even have the best first film out of the three franchises. Nothing but praise here.

5.0,"Dune is a cinematic experience unlike anything I've ever seen. It's truly a perfect movie, and easily Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece. It's a stunning achievement, a modern art blockbuster, and left me stunned in silence and awe when it ended. I grinned the whole way through and wanted to give the movie a standing ovation after! It completely shattered all my expectations, and I was already very excited for this! I LOVED it, it's easily one of the coolest things I've ever seen, and one of my favourite experiences I've ever had watching a movie! It's a perfect translation of the book, and handles the complex lore so well! Villeneuve and his screenwriters clearly understand and adore the source material, they found a way to recreate scenes exactly how the book describes them! It was surprising how well scenes seemed to play exactly how I imagined they would! The movie handles the world building and exposition stunningly well, and I loved that the script didn't dumb down the story and maintains the intelligence of the novel, blending the themes of religion, politics, power, nobility, betrayal and ecology in such impressive ways. I'm so happy someone found a way to finally successfully translate this complex story to the screen after Hollywood's many failed attempts. I never thought it could be done with this much perfection and majesty. The story is very dense and has a lot of moving pieces, but I like that the film doesn't spoon feed it to the audience and lets us interpret many elements for ourselves. It trusts us to follow along with the story, although I do wonder how hard it would be to follow without a pre-existing understanding of the novel. The plot is gripping and moves really fast, especially once you let yourself just be absorbed into the atmosphere of the film. The characters are all so rich and unique, and the cast is freaking incredible. Everyone brings their A-game, especially the brooding Timothee Chalamet, who until now I haven't really been a fan of. He is perfect as Paul, he really becomes the character, and he delivers a masterful performance with such a range of emotions and subtleties. I also thought Rebecca Ferguson was the best she's been in years! But the true star of this movie is truly Denis Villeneuve. He masterfully directs this film, ensuring every element is crafted to its highest potential. The film is hypnotic, atmospheric and visceral, massive and epic in scale and has excellent world building and production design. What I also love is that while Villeneuve embraces such a massive scope, he never sacrifices character to do so, as this is a very character and relationship driven film. But wow, is it ever an incredibly cinematic film. It feels like an old-school Hollywood epic like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and much like that film it is an ode to the desert. Like that film, the cinematography in this movie is beyond beautiful. It's gorgeous to look at and frames scenes in such creative, perfect ways. It just jaw droopingly good, the movie is worth seeing for the visual experience alone, its a feast for the eyes. The lighting is also really well done, and helps to make the CGI look as good as it can! Villeneuve also cleverly grounds the CGI by shooting as much practically and in camera as he can. And it pays off, it just all looks excellent! The sets are intricately detailed and massive, the costuming is wonderfully intricate and it all comes together to create a world that really feels lived in. The action is sparse as this is more of a drama focused sci-fi, but when it happens its extremely well choreographed and shot to create intense, gritty fight/battle scenes. The attack on the Atreides is easily a highlight, or even Duncan's hallway fight too! Now, all these visual elements are excellently accentuated by the incredible sound design! The mix is one of the deepest and most complex I have ever heard, from Hans Zimmer's incredible score to sound effects such as the ""voice"" power. Zimmer also crafted one of his best, most unique and detailed scores that fits the movie perfectly. Its just such a unique auditory experience, and combined with the stunning visuals it just created such a sense of euphoria in my head as my senses were overwhelmed with the world of Dune. This is a movie that you would be doing a disservice to yourself by watching it at home, it must be seen on the biggest screen you can find (such as IMAX). Its just such an incredible experience that truly reminded me why I love cinema and going to the movies! It's feels like a mix of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, which I love, and yet this story predates and possibly inspired both. I cannot wait to see more from this world, and I really hope we get the 2nd part of the story made! Ultimately I have absolutely no issues with this perfect piece of cinema; on a technical level this movie is flawless and has so much attention to detail. And that is all because of the master himself, Denis Villeneuve, who crafted it with so much love, care, but most importantly, skill. Its a true cinematic treasure, and gave me the same feelings as the first time I saw Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (I smiled the whole way through)! Dune is a stunning, majestic achievement and easily the best film that has come out all year.

1.0,"I'm truly shocked by the number of people who actually like this garbage. It's an almost 3 hour movie that doesn't even have a satisfying ending but a cliffhanger so it could end in a second movie. To me that's the laziest way to end a movie. To end a movie and if you want to make a sequel make it ambiguous and so the audience that say oh what's next but also think dang that's it. And make them believe that's the end but then secretly have a sequel that. The pacing was very slow and I legit wanted to fall asleep due to it's long long runtime. I've never seen the original 1980 something dune but now I want to, to see if it's somewhat better than this garbage. The acting is very bland and not really anything. It's just monotone nonsense. I get that this movie was attempting to be the next big franchise but in my eyes this is not it. But I am surprised by how many people actually enjoy this movie. Maybe because of this whole lockdown thing people have no taste. I don't know but I have no clue how people could last 3 hours in a theater. I'm so glad this was on HBO max and I could barely make it through the first hour and 45 minutes. After that I had to take a break aka 2 hours to then have the patience to sit through the rest. In the end this movie could've been something with better acting, better writing and that's it. This movie looks like a huge spectacle. I bet Warner brothers spent a lot of money on this and it shows. The only compliment I could give this movie is it looks fantastic. But unfortunately this movie doesn't amount to anything and will be in the $5 bin at Walmart either this Black Friday or the next year after that.

Every shot is filled with grandeur and beauty. When it comes to the narrative the film takes it's time to introduce us to the world and it's characters. The slow building can put off some people but once the film gets going in the second half it's a treat. The film has the emotional depth of a cardboard and despite Timothee Chalamat's superb performance we don't really care for his journey.

5.0,"I read Dune as a teen. The book immerses you in a foreign and complex world. It could be slow, but it sticks to you like tar, and your soul never seems the same again. 

So if you love the books, know that Villeneuve didn't just transcribe the book to film, but as an artist faithfully interpreted the source material while respecting film as a medium, and the world today.  I couldn't give it a better review. It is the best book adaptation ever, of any book.

If you never read the book it explains what is needed along the way, but barely. You'll have to think while watching it. The file is slower, but paced purposefully and filled with amazing cinematography that truly captivates. If it doesn't get the Oscar here I'll call B.S. Must see.

So, my one complaint, is it is really half a book, and it does lack the payoff one would expect in  film. I understand, a 4-5 hour movie isn't economically feasible in today's world.

1.5,"My review on this movie is two fold, one as a stand alone flick and the other a comparison to the original movie (not the book).   Compared to the original movie the cinematography is superior (as to be expected) but they spend a LOT of time showing you just how great the cinematography is (unnecessarily so with scenes that could have been much more concise yet still as powerful).  The use of scenery and visuals draw out the running time and slow the story progression with adding little value.  The acting quality (and dialog) for the leads (Paul, Jessica) is poor.  Ferguson does what she can with what's written but Chalamet is reminiscent of the wooden Hayden Christianson.    Issac (who usually does excellent work) is somewhat stilted by the dialog though he is passable.   The two who shine here are Mamoa and Brolin.   Mamoa thrives in the role and is ""must watch"" in every scene he's in (even the non action ones).  Brolin also delivers his dialog with a punch as good as his action scenes.   Overall the script seems stilted, slow and forced (except when Mamoa and Brolin are on screen - Bautista is believable as the beast Raban but there is little for him in this movie).   Overall a moribund script, pounding score (with no real life to it), poor acting from the main character does not make it worth a three hour time suck (but if you're watching at home, fast forward to the scenes with Mamoa and Brolin) - then put on the 1984 version and enjoy.",Stephen S,False,False,False,False,1.5,"Oct 24, 2021",Stephen S,/user/id/b2b9c24d-4960-4898-9b50-fc44f41d6b5c,RT,b2b9c24d-4960-4898-9b50-fc44f41d6b5c,

5.0,"While Dune's terminology rich lore and the speediness at which it is delivered, usually while there is a lot of eye candy and intense music happening, may not be for everyone, I think most could agree that it is a visual/audial experience like no other and I personally feel that its one of the best science fiction films ever made.  The creative energy behind Dune is palpable as is evident with each shot.  Everything from ships/tech to the environmental storytelling, awesome characters/villains and stunning cinematography/set pieces really transport you to the story's universe in a way I don't think any science fiction film has ever done for me.  The bassy drumlines and striking, heart stopping vocals of the soundtrack also give moments an epic punch to them, I was shooketh.  Sometimes however I felt the loud music overpowered important dialogue and was present in scenes that didn't need it.  By the end, the effect kind of wore off a bit as a result and I think a lot of people might miss some classic lines from the book.  Granted, this may only be a problem in IMAX; perhaps in normal theaters the sound is more balanced, or maybe some speakers in my theater were out but if anything the issue will be easily remedied with home theater systems.  Despite this however the audio experience is generally phenomenal and the film is absolutely worth experiencing in an IMAX theater if you can, would highly recommend as it was super immersive!  Casting choices are on point with Skaarsgard delivering an amazing performance as the Baron, Chalamet crushing it as usual, and Ferguson portraying Jessica beautifully.  Everyone else does an amazing job too but they stood out to me.  Again the film delivers a lot of lore very quickly while dazzling with its visual and audial splendor so it's easy to miss things; everyone I went with found it hard to follow at times.  I personally felt that the lore and universal politics at play were presented quite nicely for how complex it is in the source text; I never felt dragged down by it, but it does come fast.  Motivation for a second/third viewing if anything!  It definitely might not be as accessible as Star Wars, Marvel or LotR but I think there's a lot to enjoy here for general audiences especially in the visual and sound- it's just a lot to injest and may seem slow/convoluted for some.  The same can be said about lots of classic science fiction though!  I think if part two does as good of a job as part one it could be the best body of sci fi cinema ever.  For me it was a perfect adaptation and took me back to how it felt reading the book when I was younger.  It surpassed my expectations; I was honestly mind blown, but I'm trying to be objective here.  Not everything makes it into this theatrical release but all the important bits seem to be present and I'm sure there is a lot more to come in part 2!

4.0,"To be completely honest, my excitement for ""Dune"" was primarily due to the involvement of director Denis Villeneuve. I have no ties to the novel or any previous screen adaptations. I will say that this can be a challenging movie if you're a newcomer like myself, as this movie throws many terms and characters at you in this movie. I still thought the movie was fairly accessible and the main storyline is easy enough to follow. The movie is slow-paced for a good portion but it is constantly visually stunning. The combination of audio and visual elements keeps it engaging. The movie is a bit frustrating because it is essentially an exposition movie with some interesting world building but also some lagging moments. I am really curious how this film will age because it comes down to how hard-hitting a second part would be. The characters are portrayed well and the cast is impressive, but it's those boring yet seemingly important moments that keep the movie from reaching true greatness. I still think it is a very solid science fiction movie and the way I would describe the style from the director's previous works in the genre is that it is closer to ""Blade Runner 2049"" than ""Arrival,"" the latter I would say is one of my favorite films of the last few years.

1.5,"Director, writer, and producer (1 of 19), Denis Villeneuve is very much in love with his sets, his special effects, and his box-office-draw cast. You can tell because the viewer's time is wasted again and again either watching Zendaya‘s feet walk in sandals in the sand, or being forced to watch Timothée Chalamet brood …and brood yet some more, seemingly throughout this entire picture. Say what you will about the grotesque approach that David Lynch took to telling the story in the 1984 film, but it made you want to pick up the novel and read it from cover to cover. Even with all the modern day editing, special effects, cinematography and set design at Villeneuve‘s disposal here in the twenty first century, he falls short of presenting a more compelling story than Lynch managed to do decades prior. Comparing this film to Star Wars is ludicrous. Here's why: George Lucas managed to take a cast of virtual unknowns and through special effects, a killer soundtrack, and legendary editors, tell an original story that we're still talking about to this day. As one of —again, get this— nineteen producers, Villeneuve is focused more on scenery than story. The pacing is slow; the soundtrack is loud and obnoxious, and the actors can't convey anything convincingly. Chalamet's fight scenes especially aren't believable. As an actor he's too willowy and wispy and has to wear loose clothing to hide his bony frame. Even as a training fight, you can't tell me Josh Brolin‘s character wouldn't have wiped the floor with him, let alone a seasoned Fremen outside his own Sietch on Arrakis. Even Alec Newman was more convincing in the 2000 miniseries. With a budget of $165 million, Warner Bros. took an awfully big risk trying to make a blockbuster film that now unfortunately requires a sequel. Sadly they chose celebrity over talent, and let's hope they eventually learn from their mistakes.",Doug W,False,False,False,False,1.5,"Oct 24, 2021",Doug W,/user/id/977228947,RT,977228947,

4.0,"The original Dune was released in 1984 based on Frank Herbert's science-fiction novel 
The reception was very mixed but lots of praise when to David Lynch's surreal direction 
Now 37 years later Denis Villeneuve remakes it with updated graphics, a top-notch cast, and some neat concepts 
Apparently though this is only the first chapter to set things up so there's a lot to take away 
The players include Timothy Challamete, Zendaya, Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Jason Mamoa, Javier Bardem, and Rebecca Ferguson
Challamete plays a young boy, Paul and is having dreams of a girl, Chani warning him about the end of the planet Arrakis, a desert planet that heats up to dangerous temperatures and is home to giant sand worms
This world's sandstorms are so brutal they can tear through metal 
A war between his house of Harkennen and the Freman natives wages for the most valuable source of energy called 'spice'
But the emperor Baron doesn't want peace or harvesting, he and his people just want to take everything they can 
This 'spice' can extend human life and be essential for interstellar travel 
And the natives on Arrakis due to long exposure from the 'spice' are born with blue eyes 
Paul finds out from his mother that he is a mixture of bloodlines and dreams he could be the new leader of freedom for Arrakis 
Basically a lot of this is all setup but they do get by establishing world building and amazing visuals 
The scope of this is incredible, giant sets, outstanding visual eye candy, and some top-caliber actors 
Art direction and cinematography is brilliant too 
A slow-builder of a story and the themes are only partially blocked from having it transcend from the source material being universal and modern 
When they try to bring in the politics from the books it starts to feel dry 
The characters are weak and not fun plus some weak villains but you have very good performances to balance things out 
The basic plot it follows is people fighting  over power; the source material is very dense but digestible for adults
Not since 'Lord of the Rings' has a book adaptation been this detailed with its own culture, technology, language, and history 
It's one of those literary works of fiction that adds to its own mythos while also building on itself 
Colonialism, fighting for power, and acquiring resources are many big components of this story 
Denis Villeneuve gives viewers an otherworldly feel for a book that wasn't originally meant for the screen 
So hopefully Part 2 can flesh out some more stuff of epic proportions 
The hardcore fans will go nuts for this improving on the David Lynch version",Jon C,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 24, 2021",Jon C,/user/id/830741578,RT,830741578,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1368360447/picture

4.5,"I'm going into this fictional world with little knowledge of its prolific source material and haven't seen David Lynch's troubled adaptation in full. My expectations are solely as a casual viewer and avid movie-goer so I do not have a grasp on what was precisely translated from author Frank Herbert's visionary work. There is no denying that Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune: Part One' is a truly incredible cinematic experience; A singular cinematic treat that comes around after several years and yet it is like nothing you have ever seen before. There is some much to say about the technical brilliance on display here. This film alone is a visual masterpiece with some of the most awe-inspiring sequences to ever brought to the silver-screen. The cinematography is phenomenal, the sound design is eerily absorbing, the production design are otherworldly, Hans Zimmer's score is amazingly evocative and the visual effects are so seamless that I was convinced that every single frame was real! With every production department being top-notch, this is the closest film we have had that is visually on par with the timeless epicness or gritty intimacy of ""The Lord of the Rings"". You could arguably call it the science-fiction equivalent of the former since it was also considered to be ""un-filmable"" at one point; an ambitious work of audio-visual art!


Aside from its staggeringly immersive achievements that need to be experienced on the biggest and best screens available, the overall narrative and characters are laid-out very well. The world-building feels uniquely compelling but the characters help to keep it engaging. With a film of this immense scale, the drama feels more personal, which makes the spectacle more enthralling. There is a good balance struck with the exposition, there is a bit more urgency to the plot than expected. One thing to know is that Villeneuve's adaptation is one of a consistent tone: Somber & Serious. I can't say this is an emotionally affecting film with heart or levity so it will come off a bit cold or even dull to some viewers. But what it lacks in an tangible emotional core it makes up for in its excellent cast of performances. Everyone does a stellar job with their respective roles and there is some very good characterization that makes me care for the characters and their relationships while the film is expertly unravels its majestic settings. I can't recommend this film enough but alas this is not the full breath of Villeneuve's passionate vision of ""Dune"". It is an expansive story that was specifically plotted and structured with two films in mind. I plead to all the fans of ""Dune"" and movie-goers to see this film in the theater ASAP.

2. Duncan's character was undeveloped and the audience was not connected to Duncan's death... opportunity for depth lost.  And you have no excuse for that because of the wonderful book.
3. Rebecca Ferguson overacted.. almost expected her to break into excruciating spasms every minute.  Roll eyes
4. Oscar Isaac was great but please.. are there any other actors in Hollywood besides this guy?  I'm sick of seeing him in EVERYTHING.
5. The visual affects, the costumes were absolutely stunning and really the best part of the movie.

5.0,"With most sci-if films now, I feel something that is greatly missing is ambition, and above all, vision. Such film franchises like Star Wars have failed because the personality and vision aren’t there, there is no plan, and also because people have grown sick of it, and cause it just feels like spam. Other sci-fi I have seen are lacking a lot in scope and scale, and some films I see feel like they take the cheap route so they can make a sequel that winds up getting canceled cause no one wants to see it and cause the movie fails, *cough* Artemis Foul, Chaos Walking, etc. But with this film, Denis Villenueve blew me away by bringing everything that was missing from these films. A filmmaker that gives a sh*t about everything he is making, and has an incredible vision for Dune. And unlike most movies that have failed sequels, I feel Dune is actually going to succeed, and unlike other franchises that have become stale and died down, this feels so incredibly refreshing and feels like it is reviving the sci-fi genre. Also worth mentioning since this is a remake, unlike 99% of remakes that come out only for money and exist only for the sake of existing and grabbing cash here and there, this is probably the best remake I’ve seen in a long time. A remake that builds in every single way that the original by David Lynch, and doing something completely new and refreshing. From turning a movie from the 80’s that’s basically a piece of trash, to a masterpiece. The scope and scale of the movie is pretty phenomenal, from the world, story, and characters it has established, it feels so unique and like it was made by a master. Without a doubt one of the most ambitious movies ever made, and you can tell every single person involved in this project is bringing their A game on it. I feel that making a video on this movie would definitely be the way to go when discussing this movie. Genuinely excited to see the next Dune and where they take it next. I feel almost certain it’ll be as good and successful. This is even the kind of movie that I want to see more of and have everyone take from as to why it worked. Hypothetically, If this is a sign for things to come, and this might sound hyperbolic, we could probably enter a literal golden age. Everyone should go out of their way to see this incredible film, and for those morons review bombing this movie for what Denis said about marvel, go f*ck yourself.

3.0,"Read all the books, watched both the 1984 Dune movie and the SYFY TV series, This is probably the worst attempt at Frank Herbert's Magnum Opus so far.

The movie isn't total trash, good actors, good set and prop design, good costume design, and a few small moments and details keep it out of the trash bin.

But overall this is another loud, dark, and obnoxious DV movie with little substance or weight to it. Ala Bladerunner 2049. It's another one of those movies made by and for a generation of people that are content to be ignorant and stupid while skimming only the surface nuances of a story.

3.0,"While I have never read the book it's based on, I have watched all the adaptations of the Dune novel.

Positives:  

Ship designs: I loved the ship designs.  The main characters do a good job delivering their lines.

Casting: There are some big names here, and they do a good job. Although the Jessica character often looked like she was laughing when I think she was meant to be crying.

Negatives: 
First and foremost: the sound levels.  It's one of those ""whispering dialogue to loud action scenes"" movies.  

Characters: While I knew the characters from previous versions, this version did very little to set up the individuals or tell us anything about them other than their names.  I kept getting the names Gurney and Duncan mixed up, and had to go on Wikipedia to remind myself what the difference was in their roles.  

Visuals: It's an ""everyone wears black ALL the time"" movie. The villains are all generic sits-in-shadows types. Hope you don't want to know what character is doing what, because it's all going to be happening in front of a green screen in the dark.

The characters in Freman suits STILL aren't wearing the headpiece.  You'd think we could get at least some kind of clear head covering that would let the actors be seen, or pull a Tony Stark in the Avengers movies and cut to their face under the mask.  

Plot and Backstory: Again I know what spice is used for based on other movies, but this one just says ""space travel"" and blue eyes.  I did not hear ""the spice must flow"" once.

Pacing: For a 2.5 hour movie, they seem to rush through scenes but don't really establish anything.",Jeremy M,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Oct 24, 2021",Jeremy M,/user/id/782977736,RT,782977736,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/505855453/picture

3.5,"Dune 2021 is a solid Hollywood spectacle of a film that should appeal to a mass market. Extremely beautifully shot. Like every shot could be a painting or poster hanging from a wall. However, Villeneuve has skirted around adapting the un-adaptable story of Dune to the big screen by literally stripping it down to its essential story beats. With the exception of Paul and Jessica there is literally NO character development in a film with a near 3-hour runtime. Characters just speak and do things with NO motivations or backstory to why they feel the way they do. Characters like Leto, Gurney, Thufir, Raban, the Baron, Piter and Kynes got done dirty. And story elements like the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles (CHOAM), Spacing Guild, the Navigators, Shaddam IV, Irulan, Feyd Rautha, were left out entirely. The entire film is based around the control and export of this commodity called Mélange but yet Villeneuve never shows the audience what the stuff actually does or is used for or why it is so important to the Landsraad.

5.0,"I rarely write reviews. But I have on occasion wondered what it must've been like to be a part of the original audience when viewing a piece of landmark cinema such as 2001 space odyssey or Star Wars: A New Hope… it must have felt like watching Dune. 

Yes, through much of the film you feel lost. This is a fair criticism. But it's only because it's telling one small story in a vast universe. Much like Star Wars, there is an empire filled with imperial families of various power. I am so intrigued to learn more about this universe, and I understand people who might be frustrated by this film that gives you so little exposition, opting instead to let you learn visually how incredible each of these characters are. 

It's visually beautiful, it sounds amazing. But ultimately, the story it tells is very simple. I won't spoil anything, but pay close attention to the conversation between Paul and his father before they leave their home world.

For all of Dunes complexity, it's a story about finding one's own path to greatness.

4.5,"Villeneuve's DUNE is a stylistically beautiful and narratively well-crafted adaptation of Herbert's classic science fiction novel. It sticks fairly closely to the structure of the book, but does leave some holes and some subtle moments from the book might be lost on viewers not familiar with the source material. There are differences from the book, to be sure, but all of the major notes are there and adapting DUNE is a significant challenge. Villeneuve was up to the task. The art design of the film is spectacular, with some nods to Lynch's DUNE here, but the sound design is vastly superior to the earlier attempt. Very well acted and maintains a good balance between the political conflicts, human drama, and action. This isn't fast food action scifi, it's slow cooked and rich.",Christian Lindke,True,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 24, 2021",Christian Lindke,,Fandango,cb4010d8-8c6f-4676-b1f8-2d1d25be9d70,
4.0,"Honestly, I have not read the 1965 novel that this is based on nor the 1984 film by David Lynch. However, I am a huge fan of the director Denis Villeneuve and loved all the films he has made so far. The premise is ""Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive"". So is this another hit by Denis or his first work I don't like?

Let's get the obvious out the way first, Dune (2021) is a visual spectacle! The cinematography by Greig Fraser is wonderful. Every shot in Dune is gorgeous whilst also capturing the beautiful and grand nature of the otherworld planets. The costume and set department also do a wonderful job of really making it seem futuristic. Especial praise to the design of all the spaceships as they are remarkably designed. The CGI is very good as well, thankfully. Hans Zimmer of Interstellar fame does the music score for this film and it is magnificent. He uses to great effect a choir and electrical instruments that elevates every scene in the film. Dune (2021) also features a stellar cast who all do a great job in their respective role even those with little screen time. My biggest praise has got to be for Stellan Skarsgård as the Baron who is just creepy and unsettling every time he is on-screen.

The story is also very intriguing and engaging. There is a political aspect throughout this series that gives a Game of Thrones vibe. There are alliances, secret agendas and backstabbing that keeps you glued to the screen. The movie also focuses a lot on world-building with the noble families, the ""voice"" power and the Fremen; a group of natives to the desert planet. All of this lore make the world of Dune feel more vibrant and unique similar to that of Lord of the Rings which managed to pull you in; Dune (2021) does the same. Denis does a great job in making all the politics and jargon stated, easy to understand for the audience.  There are also a large variety of characters in the film and Denis does a phenomenal job in making it clear what their personality and agendas are. The main character,  Paul Atreides played by Timothée Chalamet, has a clear character arc with the struggle of his power and him being next in line for House Atreides. Most of his story arc gets a clear resolution by the end of the film.

However, Dune (2021) is a part 1 that just covers half of the book and it shows. Most movies build up to an epic 3rd act but Dune (2021) just ends midway through the 2nd act. This ends up feeling very jarring, to say the least as it doesn't end on a high note. It is also incredibly slow-paced. Since a majority of the film is dedicated to just exposition and explanation of the world; it results in a lot of moments that feel dull and sometimes boring. Additionally, the fight scenes and action scenes are serviceable but could be improved. Apart from the fight scenes with Duncan (Jason Momoa) the others are choreographed blandly and shot awkwardly as well. 

Overall, Dune (2021) has a lot of love and effort put towards bringing the grand vision and scope of the novel to the big screen. Every frame in this film is eye-catching thanks to the cinematography, costumes and set design that had a lot of thought put towards it. Nevertheless, it is a very slow paced movie that might deter some people from enjoying it. Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed Dune (2021) and it was no doubt one of the most memorable Sci-fi movies to come out.

First, this movie gave off a very nice ambience feeling, but it almost feels like it was used to make this movie so iconic and incredible, but I just never got that feeling while watching it. I certainly enjoyed the setting, the movie kinda portrays the desert as some sort of villain. The time period and the plot of the movie helps back that up and gives it more meaning. The music in this movie is also very good, but it felt like it wasn’t really used correctly. Almost like it didn’t match the specific scene that it was played in. It also contained very good fight sequences, as little as there may be. This movie felt like one of those movies that I would only watch once, but not willingly rewatch it for fun. In my opinion, it failed to live up to my expectations, which were originally going to be a full 10/10 due to very good ratings from critics and audience reviews.

The scale of this film, apparent in the visual effects and the score and the composition of sets, is enrapturing. While some of my favorite aspects of the book (the politicking) is removed in order to streamline the narrative, the first half of this story DOES still have an arc for Paul. It is clear in one of the movie-only story beats: his visions of Jamis. We're told that Jamis will be a mentor figure, helping Paul to navigate and acclimate to desert survival. The subversion of this that they end up doing 100% landed for me. The essence of that vision came true, just not in the way we thought it would. The other major drawback of the film is the fact that I've envisioned a restructured adaptation that I thought would fit better, but I can't fault them too much for doing a very faithful adaptation of the source material.

3.0,"Honestly, it felt less like an adaptation of the first half of the novel and more like watching a three-hour documentary on the true events behind it (...in 3D). I will say that it was consistently engrossing, both on a visual level, and in the attention to detail (especially for someone obsessively familiar with the source material) - not unlike watching, say, three good hours of Game of Thrones. But it wasn't terribly *exciting*.  Too many story beats fall disturbingly flat, and the dialogue is so deadpan it almost feels self-conscious. The most pleasant surprise for me was Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Kynes. The character has a bigger role than in the book, played with so much heart she practically carries the film. The rest of the cast, by comparison, feels like their personality was sucked-out through their eyeballs. Skarsgard's Baron was not just an homage to Brando's Kurtz but a blatant rip-off (and not a lot else). All in all, it's as if Villeneuve was so terrified of Lynch's quirky, Shakespearean take on the property (and particularly of it's polarizing effects) that he backed himself into the corner of playing suffocatingly safe with it.

5.0,"This movie is definitely worth your time. I've watched 3 times between the theater and HBO max and each time it gets better. I'm not a huge dune fan nor am I someone who rewatches movies right away but this movie is so big I had to see all the things I was unclear about again. I've never seen a world so alien represented in film, every shot is just a study in world building. Dune is a tough story to tackle and you come away feeling like not much was cut in writing the script. Everything is there and despite the 2.5 hour run time I found myself wishing there was more to it. I won't get into much else but will definitely say this is really something to see and I personally found more detail in watching it at home on a large high def screen, but the theater was great too.

This rendition of dune is just horrible. Dune is the original GoT. The politics, the characters, the spice are all things that make Dune special and all the things this movie lacks. Having Paul portrayed as a scared, emo, frail teen is pathetic and a far cry from the arrogant playboy prince who had to grow up. What is most criminal is how horribly utilized and enveloped Skarsgards baron was. This character had all but 10 lines. It's pathetic. Key plots twists and dialogue from the book, that made the book special are non existent to say the least. Where is Irulan? Where is the Emperor Shadam? The spacing guild? All these things make Dune. The spice must flow was NEVER once mentioned. Spice is the key and it's an afterthought here. If you think this movie is good, you should absolutely rethink your life.

Just make a friggin' movie already and STOP trying to hold us hostage. Two and a half hours of CGI under saturated, soft focus, bloated scenes!

Especially with this cast. Although they've already killed off most off the over used actors so they will have to get a whole new crop of over used actors for the next one....and kill them off...
At least they stayed somewhat true to the book but where they veered off it was obviously to bloat the story line because those scenes added nothing and just made me scream 'get on with it already!'

2.0,"Sad to report: Dune didn't work for me at all. As with Villeneuve's last effort, the eye-candy is amazing. The film looks like the best of Chris Foss and Moebius brought to life. The acting is top notch, and the cast all look the part. The score is wonderful. But the story has been stripped so bare that most of Herbert's ideas are missing and the plot is unexplained to the point of incomprehensibility (at least to those who haven't previously read the novel). 
The format has been changed from an intricate ensemble parable about power, religion and ecology, into a simple hero's journey told through the eye's of Paul Atreides. Yet somehow, despite leaving out massive chunks of the story (The tragic rift of Leto and Jessica, the Emperor, Princess Irulan, the mentats, the weirding way, the spicing guild, and Feyd-Rautha are only some of what's missing), Villeneuve only manages to cover a third of the novel in a run time twenty minutes longer than David Lynch's complete telling. 
The absence of key story elements removes the rationales for (and the reasons to care about) most of the twists and turns in the plot. So much of the run time is devoted to vistas and fight scenes, and so little to establishing the motivations of the many secondary characters that none of their anger, betrayals and sacrifices carry any genuine emotional heft. The Harkonnen, originally complex characters with plenty of issues of their own, have been reduced to Saturday morning cartoon villains worthy of an episode of He-Man, and I found the greatly reduced role of Jessica, one of the first great female characters of science fiction, to be particularly painful (although arguably expected, given the director's difficult track record with misogyny, much debated when BR2049 came out). 
To my mind, this wasn't really Dune, so much as a very nicely shot, big, dumb Hollywood action movie inspired by the imagery of Dune. They did what they did with The Lord of the Rings, only to a much greater extent: extract the bits  that a thirteen-year-old boy would consider ""cool"" from a thoughtful, theme-led story. But whereas Peter Jackson kept enough Tolkien in his story to keep the sprit intact, here they binned literally everything that made Dune the important book it is. What remains is a SF adventure as glorious but empty as the desert it depicts. 
I don't buy the argument that Dune is inherently un-filmable. Its politics are no more complex than Game of Thrones, and it's ideas are no more weird and intellectual than 2001 or Arrival's or Bladerunner's. We know it can be done from David Lynch's flawed masterpiece, and the credible miniseries. They just didn't really try.",Adam M,False,False,False,False,2.0,"Oct 23, 2021",Adam M,/user/id/976556904,RT,976556904,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/249733772200493/picture

3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. As someone who read the book, I can understand the difficulty in trying to determine which pertinent details should be the focus of a film and having to rush some things in their explanation. But the scene setting should not be one of those things. I thought the scenery of Caladan was too gray and dreary. For a place that was referred to as one of flowing water and greenery from the abundance of rain, certainly the scenery for their time on that planet could have been less bland. Even the waters were dreary, and it seemed like it wouldn't have been a hardship to leave a place if it were always so gray. As for Arrakis, I get that sci-fi movies make everything super-industrial. But Hollywood has become very one-sided in portraying such scenes as block-looking behemoths of steel. I can't fathom why better imagination cannot come up with futuristic worlds that aren't anything other than blocks of steel,  even in a harsh world. 

All of the male actors were great and portrayed their characters well. Especially Chalamet as Muad Dib. I'd never seen this  young man before, and he played a fantastic protagonist. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Lady Jessica. She is a major character and,  in this first installment of the film, the lead female. I do like Rebecca Ferguson. But, she was either not the right person for the role or her depiction needed to change. Lady Jessica is a beauty but, more than that, strong-willed and one tough cookie. She was portrayed quite the opposite in the film. She was bland in appearance (wearing her hair in a formal, tight knot and drab dark clothes). And I felt she was portrayed as an emotionally weak woman as compared to her character in the book.

The 1966 Frank Herbert novel had it all, or all that seemed then and still seems now to encompass what ""all"" is: Emperor, Baron, Duke, prodigal son,witches, aliens, a seductress, ginormous extragalactic annelids, an life-enhancing yet addictive panacea, armies galore in battle upon battle both large and small, et cetera, et cetera, and so forth.

The 2021 film adaptation of the first half to two-thirds of the book is both less and more. It's the Lord of the Rings without sass, Star Wars without quirkiness, a pompous, overblown grandiosity that takes itself way too seriously. Spice aka Melange is its One Ring or Force, intended to demonstrate that ownership of what generates unsurpassed wealth equals power equals control. And to think, I never knew that!

The production design and lighting aren't just atmospherically dark, they're so darn dark that I had to turn out all the lights just to see the film. And you know what they say: Once you turn out the lights, the party's over. Never truer than here.

The Hans Zimmer soundtrack sucks out all the breathable oxygen. Overbearing, seemingly omnipresent Tuvan throat singing — a technique of which I'm usually quite fond — is reminiscent of the Twin Peaks mood music by Angelo Badalamenti but utterly bereft of charm. Like the post-mid ‘80s Saturday Night Live, it doesn't know when to stop. Hans, baby, quit hitting us over the head with Dune's inept attempts at animistic spirituality! Your exotic Walls of Sound cannot rescue this second apocalypse now, 37 years after David Lynch's apocalypse then.

This fool-me-twice-shame-on-me cinematic adaptation of a popular gothic fantasy novel masquerading as science fiction is proof positive that Frank Herbert's Game of Thrones preincarnation, a long time from now in a galaxy who-knows-where, isn't so much unfilmable as it is actually a chimera of inexcusable conceit. World building alone, in science fiction novels, doesn't make those stories science fiction. Neither does situating them elsewhen, nor piling on the swordplay and gore until our own bile rises in involuntary intolerance.

For all you young, aging, and agèd Duneatics, give it up. I'd advise y'all to satisfy yourselves with the 2001 Dune video game, except it crashed and burned, too.

In between, anyone paying attention would have shared sudden and convincing moments of anger (Paul at Jessica, Duke at Paul), ecstatic release (Shadout Mapes when she believes, truly, perhaps for the first time, she is speaking with the mother of a messiah), affection (Leto to Paul), fear (Paul seeing horrifying possible futures, the Baron cowering against the ceiling), suppressed anxiety (the bravado of the men in the strategy meeting), pity (for Jamis, for Paul), courage (Duncan, Liet), embarrasment (Paul and Jessica changing into stillsuits), remorse (Paul confronted by Luke, Liet struggling with her conflicts), amused scorn (Chani), and a stunned awe (Chani).  In fact, the movie improves in minor moments over the book's emotional intelligence, and does so much to convey emotion that the combination of visual beauty, brisk pace and relatively infrequent expositional pauses (after the first 15% of set-up) are likely to leave many of those who have not read the book with a stronger sense of lingering emotional confusion than they can explain.  This movie will bear rewatching, and the pull towards the sequel is stronger than any plot-driven cliff-hanger could have produced.

Flash forward to 2021 version, this movie is also true to the book but with Villeneuve style and updated visuals. As another reviewer said, Villeneuve’s visual style is unmistakable and will remind you of Blade Runner 2049, for better or for worse. All the characters (by Villeneuve’s design) are so droll and dark, like someone just killed their cat. I was pleasantly surprised by Momoa’s acting which I thought would be too over the top. Going into this movie, I didn’t know it was going to be a 2 parter. I’m sure that will turn a lot of people off because the 2nd movie hasn’t been filmed (and I just found out, hasn’t been green lighted yet), so there will be a long wait for the next installment.

2.5,"Paul Atreides and the Philosopher's Spice.  

Welp, what a disappointment.  While the visuals and sound score for the latest Dune movie are gorgeous and grandiose, the dialogue and performances are not.  All the acting and actors were competent, but many of the scenes just lacked emotional depth and power.  It was surreal to watch the bland performances and awkwardly reimagined scenes set against majestic backdrops.  I see this as a direct result of trying to simplify the source material for mass audiences, stripping out the mystery from key elements of the story to make it more accessible.  If the previous movie by David Lynch failed by being too esoteric, then this one by Denis Villeneuve fails by being too mundane.  

Paul Atreides needed to be the backbone of the story as the heir of a planetary Duke, gifted mentat, and inheritor of massive psychic power.  Instead, he comes off as a mildly precocious and occasionally surly teenager.  There are attempts to reveal glimpses of his destiny but it's pretty clumsy.  Without having read the books or watched the other movie, it might seem like Paul is actually a fairly normal boy with a few quirks and a really bad Spice hallucination problem.  I don't fault the actor for this though, as I think it was intentional to make his character more relatable.  You can almost think of this version of Paul as an every person's Harry Potter rather than the Kwisatz Haderach born to set the galaxy on fire.

Lady Jessica appears almost like a normal mother, albeit one with a penchant for practicing weird roleplaying with her son and a nervous constitution.  She's supposed to be a master practitioner of a myriad of psychological and martial arts.  Instead, she has to haltingly recite the Litany Against Fear just to hold her shit together like some soccer mom out of her depth.  In fact, without reading the books it might seem like the Bene Gesserit in general are an organization of mostly normal women who stand out by having powerful political connections.  For example, their secret and subtle hand signals are reduced to clumsy sign language Jessica even uses with normal guards.  I found a reference online that called it ASL (Atreides Sign Language), which is both funny and sad.

Duke Leto has a decent performance.  He is relatable and projects a competent presence as a warrior leader.  But again, this comes at the cost of demystifying his character.  In the book, he was a near prophetic figure.  He willingly sacrificed himself for his son's ascension.  The first movie understood this and made sure to include a key message he gives to Paul: ""Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.""  Here, he comes off as largely unaware of the plots within plots around him.  They really did him dirty.

Poor Doctor Liet-Kynes got both a race and gender swap.  No surprise there, with minority inclusion being an important contemporary agenda.  In the book, Liet is a powerful and mysterious character who paved the way for Paul and Jessica to be accepted by the Fremen.  He was an important figure and a strong leader, but like Paul's father he willingly sacrificed himself so that Paul might go on to fulfill the prophecy of his people.  Here, Liet almost seems afraid to help until forced to when attacked by Sardaukar.  She then dies by letting a Sardaukar literally walk up behind her in the desert, just after claiming she was a Fremen.  It makes the character seem incompetent and unimportant.

Stilgar, Chani, Thufir Hawat, Doctor Yueh, Glossu Rabban, Piter De Vries, and even the Baron Harkonnen are all so forgettable that I don't even want to waste the effort delving into what was missing from their current incarnations.  To be clear, I don't blame the actors as they were clearly being directed and most were barely given any screen time to work with.  However, choices like this are probably why this movie manages to have less depth than the first one despite being able to focus on only part of the first book.

Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho.  What can I say except they steal nearly every scene they are in.  In contrast to the other bland performances, their characters are so interesting and vital it's almost like they are reading from a different version of the movie script.  I only wish the other actors were given this level of direction and freedom to breathe life into the movie.  Then again, maybe the director simply couldn't reign in these superstar actors who were willing to play support roles.  Duncan gets so much screen time and his death scene is so fantastic you might even mistake him for the main character.

As for the technology from Dune, there are some wins here.  The shield effects are simple but manage to look pretty decent and are a big improvement over the funny blocks from the first movie.  The hard plate armor of the Houses and Sardaukar are awesome and lend to the quasi medieval vibe of the Dune universe.  The Sardaukar especially make the most of their screen time and go a long way towards showing them off as well equipped elites.  By far though, the coolest tech presentation is the ornithopter.  These machines are freaking amazing and truly inspired with their dragonfly/helicopter/bird chassis design and operation.  I can see many toy models of these being sold, and I might even break down and buy one myself.

Unfortunately, one of the most important pieces of tech comes off as cheap and basic.  I'm referring to the iconic stillsuits.  Seriously, they have parts that are straight off the shelf.  Paul doesn't wear his boots desert fashion, he wears them Adidas fashion to sand walk better.  Also, I'm pretty sure I own a pair of the armored gloves they used.  The first movie was much smarter to invest in a fully customized design for the stillsuits, recognizing their value in both form and function. 

At the end of the movie, I was reminded of something Duke Leto said to Liet-Kynes after the ridiculously reimagined sandworm first contact scene.  Looking back, it was truly prophetic:

""You saw it.  With your own eyes.  It's plain to see.  Everything they've left us is in shambles.  We've been set up to fail.""

4.0,"While there are allowances for creative interpretation, Dune is an epoch, right up there with the middle earth works of Tolkien, and should be respected as such. If you are looking for a drive thru single sitting experience... this is not it.

I will also reflect that producing part one, let alone releasing it, without a firm comitment to finishing what they started is a sure way to loose whatever momentum is gained. This information alone will scare off many since executives in general are very skittish and fickle when it comes to this genre, and many of the target audience will refuse to get tricked into another empty promise that will just leave them hanging. 
TLDR: if you want real demographics, commit to finish what you started then measure the whole. Anything less with a work like this whis has already proven itself not just feasible but very viable, and you are not worthy to work this genere.

This said, and despite the studios backhanded lack of faith in the writers/producers of this iteration, the work has much promise. Solid casting (so far), good scenes without the useless filler that has become common place in others works that lack real substance to carry the audience from one moment to the next, and just shadowy enough to keep existing franchise viewers wondering with anticipation at what might yet change in this iteration. For myself, the subtle changes thus far have been spot on with the presented interpretation, and I would look forward to a continuation - NOT sequel, be very clear on this distinction. If you think sequel here, you need to reacquaint yourself with the definitions of the words - though given their tracks in recent years, I am not holding my breath for any further works.
Hope, yes. I am always hopeful for good sci-fi and fantasy works. 
Expect, no. I do not feel the existing studio has the fortitude to keep it going, which is artistic malpractice when taking on established epochs like Dune.

Firstly, the visuals and music in this are incredible. Every shot looks beautiful and this sound track is on another level - it's worth seeing just for those two aspects, but I was really impressed by the cast and their performances. The world building and pacing was great, it really introduces you to the universe well and kept my attention the entire film. I didn't cringe or think anything was cheesy either, this is just a good story, told well.

I will say at this point, the 2 guys that came with me were not as impressed as me, they were confused by the plot and the amount of information the film throws at you - BUT they still thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I would actually suggest seeing this in a Cinema, not on just a normal TV to really experience the music and the atmosphere - similar to '1917'.

Of course there are those who will not walk away with as favorable an opinion, which will ultimately come down to its flaws in story building . These flaws are surely noticeable but if your someone who appreciates both the  ""big cinema experience "" and SciFi then this almost instantly forgiven .

The original flaw in the original Dune is in fact it's lack of compelling storytelling . It's not that the story isn't compelling it's the act and art form of storytelling is absent . Which is no fault of the new creators.  We all naturally love to be seduced by storyline and this a flaw in Dune . And after experiencing Dune you can't help but feel like you just dreamt this unimaginably surreal and bizarre dream of a future world that's steeped in harsh unforgiving truth ; that you awake from and are instantly hit with a deep yearning to know more .

4.0,"I suspect this movie will fall into the ""some people love it and other people hate it"" category.

As someone who only recently read the Dune books for the first time, I thought the movie was visually spectacular, audacious, and very true to the spirit of the books.  During the movie I was trying to think of another movie that was as stunning from a visual perspective in terms of inventing a whole new world.  The original Blade Runner jumped out to me.  I also thought of the Star Wars movies and all of the worlds and creatures they created, but this was so much more than that. The movie is stunning and every single scene has so much detail to it.  If this doesn't win basically every Academy Award for visual effects/costumes/design, etc. I will be surprised.

There were little details from the book that I loved how they handled.  For example, they really did a great job of explaining and then showing ""the voice"".  And also I loved the depiction of the Atreides hand communication.

But I could also see how someone who had not read the books would feel confused and overwhelmed and ultimately disappointed.  This is very much a Part I.  There is no satisfying ending and you really did just stop the movie in the middle.  There is also a LOT going on to try to understand.

4.5,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about this franchise really besides the 
books are absolutely adored by scifi fans all over. Also went into this with HBOMax which didn't really hinder the viewing experience what so ever. It starts quickly and over time you're met with useful or even confusing information. The writing was exceptional. Some dialogue felt like it was feeding directly into certain tropes, but with the context that this is a remake of an 80s film some moments like these are bound to happen. Thankfully for me it wasn't super awesome. The editing was also amazing, but there are a few weird cuts. It didn't ruin any moments for me, but it did make me take a mental note of it because to me at least it was that obvious.

Visually this movie is 10/10. From the CGI, to the fight choreography, to the costume design. Dave Bautista looked truly scary in this movie. THATS ANOTHER THING! Movies these days have the issue of casting famous people and letting that be a crutch. Marvel movies often feel like ""ah, yes, Chris Pratt is Starlord."" Instead of making the connection with the character that's deserved to respect it's growth and decisions more. Like how you watch Aquaman and you're like, ""yup, that's Jason Momoa."" Instead of thinking about Arthur. In Dune I didn't have that disconnect. Each character truly had me going through it. 

While it ended strong and just kept that same pace, it did end pretty abruptly. I literally said ""what the fuck"" out loud and got a little visibly upset that after 2 and a half hours it would've ended with a better conclusion. Sets it up perfectly for a second movie and it doesn't have much else going for it. This  movie will set the bar for filmmaking for years to come. Much like Bladerunner 2049. It's just so insanely beautiful. Found myself saying that out loud quite often.

5.0,"DUNE (2021) - Overall amazing, well done on all fronts. See this movie in the theater!
 Fans of Frank Herbert's Dune series have been waiting a lifetime for a movie adaptation faithful enough to the books but grandiose enough for the big screen to emerge, and I think it's safe to say, the wait is over. This is the version that strikes upon all the necessary elements to satisfy not just Dune fans, but the average movie-goer as well.

 The cast is a Who's Who of celebrity A-listers: Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgard, Javier Bardem and many others. Obviously, we'd expect a lot from them, and they don't disappoint. Oscar gives a very nuanced performance as he encourages Paul to find his path and lead a doomed house from their safehaven homeworld into battle. Stellan's acting is Brando-esque and relies more heavily on visual cues, but he exudes villainy as the grotesque, plundering Baron. Even Momoa, who typically has a narrow emotional range and is a less obvious casting choice than his predecessors, is less perfunctory in his role as house swordsmaster and guardian to Paul. I have to admit, I was not entirely excited to see him take that role on, but he manages to pull it off and we even get a few laughs in from him despite the apprehensive atmosphere of the rest of the movie.  Sharon Duncan-Brewster is an odd gender swap for Liet Kynes, the Imperial ecologist / planetologist, but refreshingly, sells us on her performance. I wish Chang Chen, as the traitorous Dr. Yueh, would have gotten more screen time but with an ensemble this large, there have to be some trade-offs.

 As for newcomers, Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya as Paul Atreides and Chani, they lend enough gravitas into their roles to drive home the desperation of their situations but leave just enough teenage innocence on the table to make believable the emotional heartbreak of the vicious decision they must make to survive before the end of the movie. For Chani's character, maybe this is simple math, the way of the desert, and Zendaya handles it aptly. Timothee struggles a little bit in that final, jarring scene, which probably should have been edited more succinctly, so probably not his fault, but all in all his performance absolutely shines as he drives subtle changes from being a superfluous courtly adolescent to forging his way through to the door of manhood.

 The look and sound of the film is gorgeous, which is something we've come to expect from Denis Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer and is exactly the reason why you should take the time to see this in the theater. The first time you see the sprawling and endless waves of desert sand, you get a sense of how big this movie is and should be. The familiar beating of the ornithopter (aircraft) wings does justice to Herbert's descriptions in the book and is something that must be felt in the vibrations of the theater. The roar of the worm is amazingly believable and the sonorous blasts that underscore the tension and drives scene changes is very effective. Don't be surprised in the least if this movie racks up quite a few awards for technical achievements.

 Despite running a touch over two and a half hours, the movie paces quite well. We get to linger on the striking landscapes and long shots just enough between scenes so that the film never feels rushed and allows you time to breathe and revel in the underlying moods. Some scenes from the book were omitted and maybe could have warranted better exposition, but Villeneuve modifies the script just enough to be faithful to Herbert's vision while moving the action forward adroitly.

 If you like Frank Herbert's series, you'll enjoy this movie. And even if you don't know the first thing about the series, you will still enjoy this movie for what it is and maybe delve further in.

5.0,"I can say, with absolute certainty, that I am completely enamoured with this movie and cannot get it out of my mind. It is everything I could have ever dreamed it to be.

As an adaptation, it focuses on streaming the story to make it easier for the audience to follow - but never sacrificing what makes it Dune. The political games are there, the issues of messianic worship and manipulated faiths, the brutality of nature, the exploitation of people and lands, and at its core, a story of a young boy trying to find his place in this foreign world.

The entire cast is just fantastic (Oscar Isaac is the most DILF he's ever been, Jason Momoa is a blast, and Sharon Duncan-Brewster is astounding), but special call outs to Timothée Chalamet & Rebecca Ferguson. Timothée does a just fantastic job of portraying the internal struggle of Paul, his worries of his place in the universe and his fears when he is shown a possible future. He displays such a maturity, but also the underlying darkness that defines who Paul Atreides is. 
Out of the entire cast, if anybody is to get awards recognition, it will be Rebecca Ferguson. She delivers a powerful performance of a woman divided between her love for her son, her passion for her lover, and her duty to her Sisterhood. She has this intensive vulnerability, but finds a strength in it. She is a perfect Jessica and he is the perfect Paul.

On every single technical level, this film is an absolute cinematic achievement. The scope and scale of everything is just so gargantuan and dwarfs everything in comparison. Seeing this in IMAX should almost be required (if you are vaccinated and feel safe enough) because god damn does it create just an entire different experience. The massive screen allows for the full breadth and range of the worlds, their machines, and the harsh environments. 
The sound design and mixing completely immersed  you. The way the Voice is portrayed is bone chilling. The precognition and psychedelic whispers are haunting. Hans Zimmer creates another iconic and defining score. 
This goes to show how, when you have passionate creatives and workers, you can create a spectacle like never before. This should be part of the definition and standard for blockbusters going forward.

Dune, essentially, is a 2 1/2 hour product of some egocentric director given free reign to crap out a movie. It is the most pretentious, nonsensical movie I have ever seen in my life. It’s as if the director tossed out plot in favor of trying to impress an audience with his grand sweeping visuals. There is no story here. It is 150 minute slog. The dialogue is downright awful and eye rolling. The acting is wooden. The lead character Timothee Chamelet (or however you spell his name) is flat throughout the entire movie and has the charisma of a brick, he should instead stick to wearing fancy clothes and playing dress up at the Met Gala. I could go into other issues with this movie (apparently it’s really hot in the desert and people can’t be outside for very long, but of course we see Timothee in his black Tom Ford suit strutting around the desert in mid day like he’s on some fashion runway).

Timothee Chalament in the lead (Paul) was very good in a difficult role. There wasn't one bad performance. It was long - over 2.5 hours and towards the end it did feel long, as my wife Jo remarked. There was enough action for me in it and neither of us found it boring. My one grouse was the cutting of some very important dialogue from the soothsayer lady with the veil. In the trailer we heard her say more and it made clear what Paul was all about and what was to come. Very puzzled why it was removed. Lost the star because it it messed up the plot and Paul's role.

5.0,"First, I've got to say that Dune was a very great, and magnificent experience in IMAX. This is the first time to feel hyped for a book based movie since Harry Potter and honestly, WB made a big campaign for the movie that I like and respect. Lets talk about positives and negatives.

Positives:

The visuals are great

The acting was superb (Especially Chalamet and Ferguson)

The score suited the movie in a good way

The film itself isn't boring although it's long

The story is great

Villenuve handled the visions sequences in a good way

Action scenes were enormous.

Villeneuve takes his time to build the world and characters (an advantage to those who never read the book and disadvantage to those who read).

Although they had little screen time, Momoa, Brolin, Bautista, Duncan-Brewester nailed their roles (I honestly can't imagine anyone playing these roles but them).

The Fremen are presented as powerful, religious , yet dangerous.

I like how Villeneuve showed how hot, sandy, and dangerous Arrakis is.

Worms are perfect


Negatives:
Although I've written that the story was good but it missed many aspects that
could've made it quite better and that's a many based on a novel movies problem.

A lot of story is left out from the movie but you won't get lost in the movie.

But honestly these negative points doesn't affect the movie that much

3.5,"I'd give ""Dune"" a B. I enjoyed it, and I would say it was 75%-80% on par with the book. Some politically correct changes (Liet Kynes as a black female, diversity in the desert), but as far ""wokeness destroying a movie"", it didn't destroy this one. Just minor irritations. I like most of the main characters, but Jessica was too weepy for me. Paul was good, Leto was good, and I even liked the Baron. Raban was also played well, as was Stilgar and Chani. Gurney and Duncan were perfectly cast and acted. 

Sadly, I'm going to go on record as saying that it won't be a huge success. I hope I am wrong, but I think fans of sci-fi will enjoy it, the average person is going to yawn and think it's far too long. Also, it's only a half movie. It ends halfway through the book.

I'll be watching it again on HBO Max at some point since the first half-hour of the movie was blurry due to projection issues, and I had to go complain three times before something was done.

5.0,"Track with me...

Outside of Infinity War and Endgame, there's never been a movie I have anticipated with greater fervor than 2021's Dune. 

My first encounter with the story was reading through it in the heart of COVID, using the novel as an escape from a troubling and chaotic time. Having been fairly unassuming of the novel prior to exposure, I ended up plowing through 800 pages in three days. 

Dune is unlike any story I've ever encountered. At first sight, it appears to be a simple white-savior, chosen one run-of-the-mill story. But it's so much more. Ironically, Dune would go on to lay the groundwork for Star Wars, Harry Potter, and similar stories who would steal the model of Dune's protagonist while removing the nuance. 

What makes the story of Dune great is that Paul may be the protagonist, but he is no hero. 

Its story is one that resembles historical accounts more than a classic hero's journey. There is no good. There is no bad. Everything holds the potency for evil. Everything holds the potency for good. Nothing ever really ends.

And that's not to say that Dune inherently is a dismissive or simplistic story. By avenue of its decision to not choose absolutes, it inherits complexity and digs in its heels to the gambit of themes present: the role of women in politics, parents learning to be alright with watching their children be in danger, conquering fear...

I could go on. And yet, Frank Herbert's masterpiece has been considered ever since its original publishing to be unadaptable. I'm happy to say that Villeneuve has achieved the immaculate. 

I'm blown away and was so happy to genuinely be thrilled in the theater once again after a slew of sub-par and even heartbreaking movies (I'm looking at you The Green Knight).

In response to your sorrow-tinged question Maddie, I'm not quite done with film. Not yet. Dune has restored my joy.

4.5,"Many eminent filmmakers (e.g. David Lynch) have already found out that Herbert's novel is difficult to adapt. 
This time one of the best directors of contemporary cinema tried to do it - Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Sicario).

From the very beginning, we are hypnotized by the monumental landscapes of the desert planet Arrakis. Enjoying the slow, blunt shots, we hear the extremely killmatic music of Hans Zimmer, which perfectly fits into the mysterious and dark world.

The very story of Paul Atryda (Timothée Chalamet) causes great admiration. We observe a young man, heir to the throne of the Atreides family. He has to overcome his fear to become what he should be.
Villeneuve perfectly shows the way of this character. In addition, it creates interesting supporting characters, thanks to which we understand the main protagonist's motivation even more. Actors impersonating villains deserve special attention. Stellan Skarsgãrd and Dave Bautista are impressive in terms of facial expressions and body language. The entire cast performs decently, but not outstandingly. This is the result of the director's choices, who focuses mainly on showing beautiful landscapes, so sometimes he does not let these talented actors show off.
Another small problem is the screenplay. Especially the ending lacks a strong punch line of this amazing story.

To sum up, Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"", despite its small problems, is not only one of the director's best films, but also one of the most important works of cinematography in the 21st century.",Adam G,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 23, 2021",Adam G,/user/id/978773590,RT,978773590,
4.5,"It's time to say we have the most impressive film of 2021, Denis Villeneuve's Dune, is an impressive auteur blockbuster that becomes one of the best films of 2021, one of the cinematic experiences of the year and one of the musical works of the anus.

Denis Villeneuve, is once again consolidated as one of the best directors today. Frankly, I think that only this director could have adapted Frank Herbert's novel in such greatness. An adaptation practically faithful to the novel and that Villeneuve takes the trouble to make it in 2 parts.

The first part that the director builds for us is an amazing introduction to the world of Dune. With the delicate work of representing the lands, the planets and the environment. Arrakis, is to feel that you are recording on a real planet. In the same way, the time that its director dedicates to the presentation of each character.

Timothée Chalamet, is very well directed and manages to enter the skin of Paul Atreides with a performance that is pure feeling, the complexity of the character the young actor represents it correctly, we understand the journey and the beginning of the arc that must be carried out during the film, which is obviously unfinished and which can be developed in the second part. Rebecca Ferguson likewise provides an impeccable performance that increases her strength as the film progresses.

The villain theme is perhaps the film's weakest point. In a way, they feel not entirely exploited and remain in sporadic appearances. Either way, The Baron of Stellan Skarsgård is an interpretive as well as creative madness.

The work that Denis Villeneuve has achieved is a show in all its dimensions. The camera set by Villeneuve of wide shots, of geometry in each one of them, of details that he always knows how to highlight and of a staging as he wants it to be at all times. That is complemented by the immense photography of Greig Fraser who seems to understand the mind of his director to the maximum detail. Monstrous visual effects, from the environments to the worms you do not doubt that they are real. Artistically the film is also a pleasure where the lights are carried by the clothes, especially the one worn by Rebecca Ferguson.

The icing on the cake is none other than Hans Zimmer and his marvelous musical creation. Wow, the creation of every chord, melody and note that he uses to accompany Denis Villeneuve's work is mind-boggling.

The first part of Dune is a work that is simmered with the best possible ingredients to wait for the final tasting with all the highest possible expectations you can have.

There is a possibility that you do not like what you are seeing in a certain way because it is a movie that takes all the time in the world to explain things from Paul's dream dreams to each kingdom that is part of the story, however, If you connect with it the first time, it is a trip to perhaps one of the most spectacular visual experiences of the year and of recent times.

5.0,"This film is an easy 9/10. For those who aren’t familiar with sci-fi as a genre, not Dune the novel, the slow tempo in the beginning is to be expected. With that said, the film does an amazing job of setting the stage and backstory that’s simple and digestible for the viewer. One of the primary problems with Frank Herbert’s novel is that it immediately thrusts the reader into a complex universe full of complex intricacies with little explanation. It’s up to the reader to understand and grow their knowledge over the course of the book. The film does the opposite in an elegant and unforced way which was refreshing and great for film. The plot is very similar to the original book less a few minor adjustments which were actually improved upon in my humble opinion. The world portrayed in the film is dark, complex, and massive just how Herbert dreamed it up. Nearly every scene in the film was depicted exactly how Herbert drafted it, even adding some additional uniqueness to supplement Herbert’s writing.

1.5,"What could have been an amazing movie turned out to be a bit of a mess. The pacing was off the entire movie, with dramatic emphasis on what seemed to be random moments of starships lifting off or dramatic scenery, outshined important moments regarding the main points of the story. Had I not known the lore of Dune prior to the movie, I would have struggled to understand what was going on. This is because the dialogue regarding those important parts of the plot were expressed in the smallest of conversations and said very passively. And no emphasis was placed on what the audience should be listening for. 
The story also never seems to climax, with one major battle and then a smaller one, eventually leading them towards the MC's destiny. 
The thing is, I really wanted this movie to be great as I love the lore of Dune. I even paused the movie several times to explain to my wife what was going on, as I got excited when things were revealed but after the 4th time, I realized that many of the important parts of the plot were hard to grasp for the average watcher because of the way the dialogue lacked emphasis on what was being said or the timing would be off or they'd use other languages randomly without proper buildup or explanation. 
Conclusion, to get the most out of this movie, you'll have to watch some breakdowns of the lore of Dune on YouTube before watching it.

The pacing is perfect. Perfect. Having seen Timothee Chalamet in the title role of ""The King"", I knew he would be an outstanding Paul Atreides. The whole tale of Dune is very much about this one character's transformation. Only someone with real heft and the control to not let too much be revealed too soon can portray him well. Chalamet is perfect. Those who are unfamiliar with his work are in for a treat.

Much will be made of the cinematography, which absolutely demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. The score by Hans Zimmer is as stunning as the images, in my opinion. They are perfectly paired.

This is just Part One of a very long story. It took a half hour for the audience I was in to settle down and understand what they were about to see. This isn't some slam-bang CGI fest.

Specifically, weak dialogue and anaemic character development reveal a lack of focus on the fundamentals, while Villeneuve over-compensates with relentless screaming soundscapes and never-ending repeated close-ups. What little dialogue there is, is barely audible. I honestly can't remember much of the second half besides feeling bored and irritated by the droning noise and complete lack of personality. Chamolet's acting has been praised, but it's mostly flat, and the intended emotional complexity with his mother is lifeless.

The muted, drab colours and dark lighting work well for the universe established. I always thought the Lynch version was lit too brightly considering the dreary plot.

The protagonist is a bit bland. In fact every character except Jason Momoa's and Stellan Skarsgard's are pretty boring, but that's ok because there is plenty of engagement around these characters in this epic like the plot and the world coming to life.

The point of making an adaptation is that it can be watched on it's own, that it's enough to understand it, but I'm not going to read a book that long only to understand a movie, which I really didn't care about. Timothée Chalamet is an amazing actor as always, but I just didn't care about his character. On the other hand, there were a lot of stars in this film that were promoted to have a huge role, but appeared less then 5 minutes, like Zendaya, and that's just fake advertising.

4.0,"Great overall, hopefully the start to a new star hopping sci-fi franchise! Stunning visuals down to the last grain of sand, with astonishing CGI worms and thopters that make the OG Dune movie's FX look completely stone age by comparison. The movie's score is filled with strangled tribal calls over frantic drums that feels very Fremen in nature and mostly works. The music shines during climactic explosive moments, but at times feels like it's building unnecessary suspense where plot doesn't require it. The sound mixing and editing in general were excellent, lots of vibrations felt through the seats in the theater, especially noticable with the unique way the director chose to portray ""the voice"". If anyone's questioning the 2.5 hour commitment, it never felt long or drawn out. The length of the film was a plus as far as covering details from the book closely, with only a few plot points from the source changed or missing (see Keynes gender swap, or missing greenhouse/warning note). Honestly I wouldn't have minded even more screen time to get to know side characters like Duncan and Gurney better. Gurney not playing the ""baliset"" felt like a missed character-building opportunity. The performances from Jessica and Paul were solid, but again time wasn't taken to capture the intricacies of Jessica's conflicted feelings towards Paul's growing prescient abilities. As it turns out, showing the characters' inner thoughts the way they're presented in the book doesn't easily transfer to the screen, short of a narrative voiceover. And as for Chani's involvement, it's mostly interspersed dream sequences throughout the film remind us that, oh yeah, Zendaya is in this! But sadly the cut off point for Part 1 leaves her a brief introduction with Paul during the last 10 minutes of the film. By the end of the movie the world of Arrakis and Dune has the basic foundation built, but the meat and potatoes of Paul's journey lies ahead - hopefully because potential sequels will build on this ground work, fewer long panning shots of the dunes and sand storms to establish setting will make time for cleaner and clearer characters/motivations.

3.0,"The movie is visually stunning, although too monochromatic. When reading the book, the environs are rich with texture, the movie had very little visual depth. That's not really fair, let's say the texture had little vibrance. Even a desert environment has rich colors. I have nothing but praise for the technical expertise of the film makers. But as a fan of the books, I felt like the film makers did not actually read the books, but wrote script off of cliff-notes. There is not enough depth to Paul, no inner thoughts, and if one has read the books, the story is mostly inner thoughts of the characters. Difficult to convey in film? Yes, but the 1980's film did a fairly decent job of it. Additionally, the story explores some very deep religious and social aspects of humanity, specifically thinly veiled comments on Islam and Catholicism. Very little of which was explored except for some costuming. If the entire two and a half hours is going to cover just the first half of the book, there could have been some time for exploration. And just my personal aside, I don't think a review of this film is fair without having read the book. The cast was excellent with two exceptions. Paul, the main character, has something of a vapid face, not in line with the true depth of the character. I'm sure there's huge disagreement with that, but it's just what I saw. Also Duncan Idaho was a scrappy wiry seasoned combatant with as much wile as strength. This movie character was a looming steroid-riddled hulk-a-saurus. Where did that casting decision come from? The vehicles were magnificent, the environment, although monochromatic, was epic. It is a highly polished, slick, big-budget film with big profit written all over it, but it is not the Dune story that's etched in my mind from Mr. Herberts' books. All that being said, I'm going back to see it again sober.",Der B,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Oct 23, 2021",Der B,/user/id/979305212,RT,979305212,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/732979861436062/picture
3.5,"It's not a disappointment. Visually it's spectacular.  Accoustically, it has a complex, powerful score that perfectly matches what you see on screen.  Story wise, it falls short. One of the great aspects of Herbert's novel is the complex tapestry of social heirarchy, ritual, and intrigue.  It is only passingly alluded to here, though the major plot points are faithfully followed.

There are however some deviations that make no sense. Why, for instance, did they feel the need to gender swap one of the minor but pivitol characters, Dr Liet Kynes?  Most people won't notice if they're not familiar with the book, but it kept pulling me out of the story.  There was no need, and no justification made for it. That said the actress who played Kynes did a good job, it just threw me and took me out of the movie, which is the one thing you never want to do as a story teller.  

There are plenty of very powerful, capable women in the world and the story so there was need to present change Kynes to a female. She's not a love interest, now. There just wasn't any good reason to do it. 

There's a lot going on in the movie that begs a rewatch, and I will be going to see it again, and probably again.  

Dune is visually stunning, which for me is part of the problem. The visuals should be there to support the story and characters, but it feels like the characters are just there to give a reason for the beautiful sets, costumes, and special effects.  It seems we can do anything in a movie now days, except tell a good story, even when were handed one of the best ever written.

5.0,"This movie was one of those rare treasures of science fiction that manages to stay firmly grounded in the source material, innovate when needed, dazzle you with visually spectacular imagery, and round it out with strong writing and inspired acting. I think the attention to detail was perhaps what was most impressive, even moreso than the immense scale. The costume design, setting, the accuracy and imaginativeness of things like the technology and environment were some of the best I've ever seen in any film. 

 The characters we real and lived in, and every actor felt like the perfect casting choice. Besides the loving amount of detail given to the storytelling, the movie managed to handle the enormous scale of the story. It was awe-inspiring, a truly gripping film to experience. I felt chills run down my spine when I saw the sandworms burst from the desert landscape like a force of nature. The Dune film manages to capture the mythical aspects of the original novel, and you can't help but become swept up in the grand destiny of Paul Atreides and his companions. I can't believe they pulled it off so masterfully, I still am in shock. 

The first part of the movie spends a good deal of time worldbuilding, so there are moments when the story had slower pacing than I expected. But even then, it is still interesting to watch it all unfold. The movie never becomes too bogged down with exposition, and the payoff is completely worth it as the film gains momentum. They give you just enough to understand and then get back to the essence of the story. I was very excited to see this film and walked away so pleased. I can see this becoming a franchise on par with the original Star Wars trilogy or the Lord of The Rings films.

Was absolutely not disappointed even one drop of water! 

FANFUGGINTASTIC!!!

As of Friday 22OCT2021, there've been rumblings that Dune, Part Two has been green lit, but no official word has been given. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they bring the rest of this to fruition.

Yup. Infuggincredible!!!

It ended exactly when I had expected the cutoff to be.

All the performances were great and unforgettable. The script is very good, but treating of a First Part, the film abruptly ends.

Lynch movie lacked too much from book, or took book concepts and changed them into something different, like ""Weirding Modules"" and sound weapons to replace a  Prana-bindu physical and psychological training?

The Guild were weird and ridiculous, making sill hand gestures and head tilts. But the new film had elements never explored before, like the Bene Gesserit hand signals with subtitles, real Ornithopters, Paul and Jessica in the still tent, the Cone of Silence used by House Harkonnen to discuss plans in secret, Jessica used her legs in combat and was more Weirding than any previous version, and the spice economy and importance of Leto maintaining it was stressed.

2.5,"In creating a film epic, there has to be something ""epic"" about it in order to qualify for that designation. Unfortunately, this latest remake of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" fails on that point on so many fronts. While the special effects and cinematography are indeed dazzling and the film can justifiably lay claim to yet another outstanding Hans Zimmer score, there's not much else here to grab viewer attention or evoke an emotional response. A big part of that has to do with the film's overlong, unengaging narrative, much of which is a long, cold, boring snooze and often tediously derivative in its vision, not to mention inherently and obviously incomplete. There are also casting issues aplenty, with some performers, like Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson, being placed into roles for which they're wholly unsuited, and with others, such as Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Charlotte Rampling, being woefully underused. This is an uncharacteristically underwhelming effort from director Denis Villeneuve, a filmmaker best known for stellar work on pictures like ""Arrival"" (2016) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017).

5.0,"Review from a huge Sci-Fi fan who hasn't read the books, and failed to get through Lynch's film on 2 attempts:

10/10. I have no words that would do it justice. This is easily one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. Just the visuals and the sound design alone were breathtaking, and left me stunned. 

I can't say enough about the cast. Everybody was giving some of their best performances, but I thought that Josh Brolin especially was a standout in his smaller role. His scene with Timothée where they are training at the beginning of the film was one of my favorites.

It was very fun to watch. I know that I had a stupid grin on my face almost the entire time, but I didn't even care. If anything has ever been worth the wait, this movie was it.

I'm so glad that I was able to see it in theaters, because it was truly made for the biggest screen and best sound system. That said, I can't wait to rewatch it on HBO Max tomorrow.

The entire scene on the Imperial Army planet was unnecessary and could have been done with some simple conversational exposition. But we had to have something for Piter to do, didn't we?

I saw this in IMAX, which I feel would be doing a disservice to the movie by watching it in a regular format.

A feast for the eyes, and such a rich world. The characters are developed, likeable. And the movie is truer to the book. If I may be bold, Frank Herbert would have given this movie a full and beaming endorsement. It does not diminish Lynch's work but is a sweeping evolution of everything it could have been. The best approximation is that the original Dune was a piece of a chocolate bar. Great, but you were left wanting something.

The portrayal of the various cultures including clothing, ships, buildings, décor, art, tech, etc. was a huge task that someone should be rewarded for. It is incredible. My only complaints are small. The Crysknife should only be 20cm long, so it is easily concealed.  Also, I think the Lady Jessica was played as too weak, emotional, and unsure of herself compared to what I got from the book. She could have been a bit more like the BBC version.  Lastly, I simply do not understand why anyone would make the decision to WAIT to see how this movie did before making part 2.

The only good thing about this movie is all the stars. However, this movie seems like an insult to these otherwise amazing performers. This is quite possibly the most boring and confusing movie i have watched. I had never even heard of the Dune franchise until this movie was released. I understand this movie is based off a novel that had other film adaptations, but this movie does nothing to help first timers understand the concept. They jump right into a story and start talking about things like people should already know them. For a film doing a reboot on the story, you would think that they would give a better introduction to keep audiences engaged. They don’t. The fact that this movie is so long but doesn’t have a proper introduction is ridiculous. Most movies, even ones based on novels, inform the watcher what is going on. All said, the stars could not safe this film from being a confusing mess. Also, it is funny because Villeneuve made a claim that movies in the Marvel cinematic universe are not “cinema”, even tho they make billions of dollars and there are many movies, but it makes no sense why he would say this because this movie is clearly not cinema. It is a jumbled mess of story with only the face of talented actors to try to save it. Do not waste your money on this boring film.

1.5,"Dune was everything advertised -- well-mounted, exquisitely designed, a feast for the eyes and ears -- and didn't enjoy a minute of it.

I still don't know quite what motivates him,  or whether he actually has any goals in life.

Perhaps the derided David Lynch film from 1984 was the better interpretation of the novel. Lynch made a conscious decision to frame his shots in vibrant color, even to and past the point of being gaudy. By contrast, the new film could have been shot in black & white with few notable differences. Lynch looked at the source material and saw camp, and turned all the dials up to eleven, while the new film has hardly and life at all.

Along with detractors that were made worse than the original 1984 release. The woke overtones thrown in didn't help it and the ""to be continued"" ending was just a slap in the face that just doesn't make sense since the run time for this first half is actually longer than the entire 1984 release and it's been proven 3 hour films do just fine. They could have cut the fluff and made this a single movie that improved in all aspects. It feels weird saying the 1984 release was a superior movie considering how much it lacked itself and how campy it was. But it was what I grew up watching and it was much more memorable.

4.5,"Dune 2021 is pretty awesome for a movie without an ending. Warner Media made a big mistake in not allowing Villeneuve to film his epic in one go a-la Peter Jackson's Lord on the Rings trilogy. There is not enough filming done to put out a sequel next year, so principle filiming on a follow-up film cannot commence until 2022, so it will be late 2023 before can get the payoff of an intriguing setup. But I get ahead of myself.  The world of viewers will be split. Dune fans love Denis Villeneuve's new version. Motion picture critics and Hollywood types are  likely to laud the film for all the things it gets right. I think the rest of masses might not get what the big deal is about  because there is no payoff.

I understand the pacing of the film with all its time spent on Timothee Chalomet close-ups. The simple fact is I wanted more. That is better than wanting less, but it is now so frustrating knowing that the more is so far in the future.",Greg C,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 23, 2021",Greg C,/user/id/929312942,RT,929312942,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003331182114/picture

5.0,"I've only watched Villeneuve's Dune on HBO Max, so I will likely add to this once I make it to the one and only IMAX screen in my city (though I will see it on a regular large screen, as well; because this film is so beautifully made that it demands repeated viewings in the cinema, as even on my 40 + inch HD TV screen it clearly isn't sufficient enough due to the scope and scale of such immense and precise cinematography). 

This a very narratively muted (even austere, regarding the dialogue), yet visually majestic and glorious, and somehow believable story (regarding the technology, planetary environments, how humans interact with each other, regardless of it being 8,000 years in the future; people remain people, after all). After diving into Herbert's novel numerous years ago, I understood how truly difficult it would be to put such a rich, complex, and multi-layered story into one movie, as David Lynch attempted to do in 1984 (for which I still have a great sentimental attachment after watching it as a child on VHS many times).

I truly hope this movie is successful enough to allow Villeneuve the complete his vision for Part 2, as this a story in the science-fiction realm that is among the most important and influential of all.

Added: after seeing it on Halloween day, on a relatively large movie screen with good/great sound (Harkins Cine 1, and then at an AMC IMAX a week later), I can confirm that Dune is absolutely worth watching multiple times in a theater; it is a glorious, beautiful, meditative work of art, and the superb audio/Hans Zimmer soundtrack can truly be appreciated best in cinema.",Matthew C,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 23, 2021",Matthew C,/user/id/20a97405-5c46-4a1e-8875-0849766ca265,RT,20a97405-5c46-4a1e-8875-0849766ca265,
5.0,"I've been a Dune fan for decades, reading the original books through God Emperor of Dune, watching the Dino di Laurentis Dune in the theater, owning that movie on VHS and later DVD. I played the Dune boardgame (wish I still had it). I own the SyFy mini-series.  My expectations of this movie were hopefully optimistic but tempered by the sad fact that science fiction never lives up the world the author creates.

But damn, Denis Villeneuve did this one right. Yes, the visuals are spectacular. Much as I enjoy CGI, most of today's movies are horrible with the same boring battle scenes depicting hordes of tiny crowd simulations or massive (ahem) algorithmically generated landscapes. Not here, as the world of Arrakis and the Guild spacers and Castle Caladan lived up the image in my mind. It's magnificent. The framing, the scope, the costuming, lighting -- everything -- was stunning. But more importantly, believeable. It felt real.

Casting was equally superb. I never expect film to mirror the characters in the book as there are far too many in Herbert's novel. Trying to do so leads to a melange (ahem) of all-too-similar voices and people that it's impossible to feel for any of them. Trim too many and there's rightful outrage if pivotal characters are missing. And again, Villeneuive nails it. These actors owned their roles and disappeared into Paul and Jessica, Duncan and Gurney, Baron and Rabban Harkonnen, Chani and, yes Liet Kynes.  These actors know their craft.

Finallly, the adaptation completely floored me. How do you adapt a book that exists half the time in head-space -- thoughts, internal monologue, Princess Irulan's supporting histories -- into a visual that doesn't feel like a reading of War and Peace? How do you modernize a fifty year old story that had 1960s expectations of the role of the women and notions of empire? I don't know all the tricks of filmmaking that were used, but I know that it worked. The sense of Herbert's universe is there without the dated pieces. It worked. 

No, Dune wasn't completely flawless. There are a couple places where the Fremen's sense of revelation and emerging prophecy felt a little stilted but I understand why they needed to be there. In the book it amounts to a few lines in hundreds of pages, but in the movie there's no clean way to insert it. All said, it was handled decently. Yes, I wanted more of Duncan and Gurney. I wanted more back story of the Mentats and the Butlerian Jihad. I was waiting for Irulan to appear. But a six hour Part 1 would not have worked.

The actors have truly brought the characters to life under Villeneuve's careful guidance. I left the theater with odd mixture of supreme satisfaction and desperate longing for more. Villeneuve has quickly become my favorite current director, and I am incredibly grateful to him for brilliantly bringing one of my favorite books to life in such a beautiful and artistic way full of humanity and wonder.

The good: Visually incredible and follows the beats of the book very well. Most of the acting is great. Timothée Chalamet is perfect casting for Paul and Bautista is everything i thought Raban was in my mind. 
The Bad: despite being nearly 3 hours long the pacing feels rushed, some cuts are really jarring and i get the feeling that people who havent read the book will feel confused. Theres also a lot of shots of a bulls head that seem to serve no purpose beyond being nod at one of the prequal books. Rebecca Ferguson isnt great as Lady Jessica which is a shame considering how GREAT Timothée Chalamet is as Paul. A lot of context feels like its missing.

3.0,"I enjoyed the movie, but had some disappointments.  The BIG one is that it only covers half the story.  My first indication was that the title screen says Dune in big letters, then Part One in smaller letters.  Huh?  I was unaware of this. 

Visually, it does a great job at capturing the huge scale of everything: mere mortal people (so small) amid giant machines & vast deserts.

It has the slick look of a very modern film, but, in my opinion, lacks the artistry of the beautiful original film.  Nice musical score, though. 

At best, Im lukewarm, regarding performances.  Jason Momoa is great!  Rebecca Ferguson does a pretty good job.  Timothy Chalamet does an ok job (at best).  Theres little of Zendayas role yet, but my God, is she ever beautiful!  Overall, though, the whole thing lacks something.  For one thing, I felt zero emotion. 

The big bummer  was how little was shown of the wonderful worms.  Guess that the director is saving that for Part Two.  

Anyway, Id only personally recommend it to folks who are already fans of the Dune saga, ones who might enjoy another take on filming the story.  I would think that the uninitiated would be rendered disinterested.

5.0,"Dune is an absolute feast for the eyes and ears-- stunning cinematography accompanied by an immersive soundtrack that fits every scene like a glove. 

For those that have been lucky enough to have read the novel, you will be rewarded. I've been waiting for more than 35 years for what I consider the best science fiction story of all time. Tomorrow when I watch this with my sons, I'll get a sense of how this plays with those that don't know the story as deeply as those that have read it. 

Each ship, device, costume and technology is fantastically realized. While special effects technology has advanced so this can be made possible, Denis Villeneuve and his team deserve kudos for the creative vision in the adaption from book to screen. For example, I could never visualize the ""ornithopters"" -- the smaller flying ships on the planet Arrakis. Here they're represented as dragonfly-like X-wings that are mesmerizing. And then there's the stillsuits, the hunter-seeker, the shields and more. 

Every actor brings their A-game, but Rebecca Fergusson as Jessica and Timothée Chalamet as Paul are just fabulous. There's an iconic scene from the book where Paul is subjected to the Gom Jabbar, a life-or-death test. The scene requires both Jessica and Timothée to express themselves only with their facial expressions and body movements and they are fantastic. 

Stellan Skarsgard is more menacing than Michael Meyers in Halloween Kills as Baron Harkonnen -- in fact his whole entourage are like human Cenobites.

While this should be seen in a theater, I watched it on streaming, and to be honest, I'm glad I did. I could rewind scenes I wanted to see again and put subtitles on as needed (there is a lot of whispering and ""Dune"" language that is hard to discern).

5.0,"I love Dune. This film is almost like an introduction to a great story. When at the end Zendaya's character says, ""This is only the beginning,"" the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel.

Dune is an exceptional film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from the original sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. Fans of the 1984 version directed by David Lynch - and newcomers to Dune -- will be fascinated to see Villeneuve's incarnation. I absolutely love the cast, cinematography, CGI, makeup and many other aspects of this film.

The film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet, Arrakis - the world of Arrakis is breathtaking. I love the culture of the planet, such as the languages they speak, the homes the characters live in, and, of course, the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet. The story centers on a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who has an important role: His family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice, which is the most precious element on Arrakis. As the story unfolds, it's easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on Arrakis. At times, though, I felt I was almost missing parts of the story. Since this is an adaptation from a book, a lot of information has to be left out, and I left the theater wanting to know more about Arrakis. I also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end, although that isn't a huge issue for me.

Now let's talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role and his peers: Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Oscar Issac and many others. I've been a huge fan of Timothée Chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date. I love his character - you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place. I also love Zendaya's performance; throughout the entire movie I was waiting to see her appearance. I also love Jason Momoa's character, another one of my favorites. Finally, Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances.

The costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet. And the cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design. It's important to acknowledge Hans Zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the sci-fi storytelling to life.

The message of the film is we all have a purpose, we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world.

""Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story told surrounded by an absolutely massive scale.

Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography, despite some narrative-pacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive.

From the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie.

The only thing that really bothered me was the main Character Paul.    He is too feminine looking to play a fellow the character.  Timothée Chalamet is a fine actor if not a great one.  My problem is this role was not for him.  The original actor was Kyle MacLachlan.  MacLachlan made Paul realistic.  He was masculine and rather pretty for a man.  Chalamet is not believable at all.  He is far too small to handle a sword as he did during the fight scenes.  Wielding a sword. even one as small as a tanto,  is hard work and takes far more musculature and stature than Chalamet possesses.

4.0,"The best way to describe Dune is that it is a spectacle, and an enjoyable one at that. It's a film meant for the big screen, which is certainly a positive for the industry itself.

The film is certainly entertaining, there's no doubt about that. The many action scenes are fun to watch, engaging too. What Denis Villeneuve does best in almost all his films, his keep the tension at a high level, which is one of Dune's strengths, he's a master at it. The cinematography again builds the world of Arrakis in a unique way, cinematographer Greig Fraser deserves praise for that. The CGI also isn't overused and doesn't affect the narrative in annoying ways.

I didn't know anything about the novels going so it takes time to get used to the world, meaning that film can be too slow in parts and may pass you by, but eventually it clicks.

The films a spectacle which impressed me, Timothee Chalamet was a good lead, but Jason Momoa and Oscar Isaac gave standout performances. An amazing ensemble.

Look forward to part 2, definitely recommend seeing it in cinemas. A blockbuster in the truest sense.

1.0,"With stunning visuals I'm disappointed to say Dune does not live up to the hype. With a star-studded cast who provides great performances, many are overlooked. *spoilers* It's genius how they explained the lore through Paul watching documentaries about the planet they are moving to. The problem is there is just so much lore, which makes it hard to learn it all in such a short amount of time and keep it all straight. They don't spend enough time on some of it too.   The movie also has many pacing issues, and is just plain out boring at parts. The world building is there but very self-contained. The explanation of Paul's powers is brief, and his mother and her past is also very confusing. The scene where at the end when Paul fights the other guy is very unnecessary. If they were going to slaughter her then she could have just came out and said she was pregnant. This way no one had to die. The spice is basically like weed, but good for you and certain people's eyes turn blue and then everyone's turns blue. Like I said it's all very confusing. The ending is too open ended and leaves a lot to be desired. A good cliffhanger to set up another movies is to close the story of the first movie but still have it continue in away, but all the main plot is filled in for that part of the story. This film cannot stand on it's own as a good movie without the second one to finish it. Avengers: Infinity War is a great example of a two-part event, where the stories are continuous but wrap up in it's own movie, and not making it feel like an absolute unfinished movie or like the ending was cut like this film does. It stands alone and doesn't need Avengers: Endgame to finish the story. Same things with the Lord Of The Rings franchise. They are 3 parts of one continuous story, but each movie can stand as its own film without the one after it to back it up. This movie just doesn't can't hold itself up, and requires a sequel to make it feel better.

3.5,"The movie is beautifully shot, visuals are great, the casting is stellar and for a 2.5 hour film it never really drags. Where the movie predictably struggles is to convey the complexity of it's source material. We don't really know what Paul Atreidis or any of the other characters are thinking, which for those who have never read Dune may leave them confused at times and for those who have read the novel, frustrated. Some characters are just flat out 2-dimensional. An example being the baron harkonnen, who in the novel is a truly interesting character. 

I think this is where it becomes very clear that the director is intending to do the real storytelling in a sequel. As a stand alone, there would be almost no reason to see this film.

5.0,"We all know Villeneuve is an incredible director. Blade Runner 2049 is perhaps one of the finest movies of all time. In Dune, Villeneuve once again demonstrates that he is a directing genius. Dune has been widely considered to be one of the most difficult book adaptations. With much of the story told through exposition, such dense lore, and the magnitude of the universe, many believed it was unrealistic. They said the same about Lord of the Rings, but Peter Jackson proved them all wrong. Villeneuve has done that with Dune.

Everything from set design, to costumes, to choreography, to effects, to score and sound, to (and especially) cinematography. Villeneuve does a masterful job of pruning the unnecessary exposition to focus on the core story, telling it in a dense but expertly timed two hours and 35 minutes. My wife, who previously fell asleep in Blade Runner 2049 and has never read a Dune novel, was rapt. I, who have read 15 Dune novels, was rapt. Villeneuve has somehow turned Dune into a movie with mass appeal, while staying true to the source material and giving fans everything they could have ever asked for.

Villeneuve took the bold action of writing ""Part One"" on the title screen to ensure audiences understand that this is the first part of the book; but also to perhaps place some additional pressure on Warner Bros. to green light part part two. It will be an egregious injustice to the universe if Villeneuve is not granted the right to produce the second part of this movie.

I watched this in IMAX and cannot recommend the experience highly enough. The soundscape was awe inspiring. I will be watching this a second time in IMAX.

This movie is 10/10. I have extremely minor nitpicks which are not worth mentioning.

5.0,"The new Dune movie was phenomenal. 10/10. 

I have read the full series 3 times and the original novels, 4 times. It has ruled my imagination for the better part of two decades. It has yet to be adapted properly. The David Lynch movie was garbage. The Sci-fi mini-series got a lot of it right, but it was still pretty far away.

I have been excited for Denis Villenueve's Dune since I first read about it. He is a great director and it has an amazing cast. There are a few things that were left out and there were a few things changed, all in the effort of moving the film along. They got very little wrong (and don't think I didn't notice the things they did), but it does not ruin anything.

Two things blew me away. The first were the sandworms. They aren't exactly how I pictured them but they are amazing to see and we should get to see more of them in the future. The second is the sound. Hans Zimmer has made this such an auditory experience that is unlike anything my ears have ever experienced.

This project was too much to fit into a single movie and the story is perfect to be split as there are two deinitive parts to the novel. Sadly Warner Brothers did not let both parts be made at the same time and the sequel is dependant on the success of this movie. With the decision to release it on HBO Max simultaneously with the theatrical release, they have taken away a lot of the possible box office earnings. 

Go see it in theaters. Then come home and watch it again and again on HBO Max.

Denis Villenueve hit for the cycle with this one, topped off with a grand slam. Make many more Dune movies, Warner Brothers, not just the sequel. Please.

3.0,"Let me preface by saying that I've never read Frank Herbert's book.  My only previous experience with Dune was the 1984 film with Kyle Maclachlan.  I can understand why some people dislike the 1984 version, but I kind of enjoy it.  That being said, I enjoyed the 2021 version of Dune, BUT I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked.  First off, I was unaware going in that this version was going to be split up into multiple movies.  That was a big kick to the groinal region when the movie just up and stopped shortly after Paul Atreides meets up with the Fremen on Arakkis.  I haven't read ahead, but I sincerely hope that they shot the rest of the movie already and then split it like has been done with other multi-part movies like Back to the Future and The Hobbit.  I'd hate to think that the studio might pull the financial plug on making the end of the movie if it doesn't recoup its costs and turn a tidy profit...which is entirely possible given that it didn't debut exclusively in theaters.  Sci-fi fans are a gregarious lot, but I'm not sure they have enough disposable income to put this film over the top.  However, given that there's just not much (quality options) out there to watch at the theater (or even on TV), Dune, Part 1 may make back what it cost to produce and then some.  My favorite thing about the 2021 version of Dune has got to be the CGI.  Even so, I think it may have been UNDER-used.  Dune is all about spice and the worms, but in Part 1, we barely see the worms other than an occasional shot of a gaping mouth that, frankly, looks like an anus.  All the spaceships, the buildings, and the planets are well done.  I'm sure the David Lynch 1984 version might have had a few more fans had the special effects been better executed.  Speaking of the 1984 version, I like the acting in it better than the new 2021 version.  Most all the actors appear too ""calm"" for my taste.  The Atreides HATE the Harkonnens.  The Baron is truly despicable and mad.  I just don't get the emotion I saw from actors like Kenneth McMillan or Patrick Stewart in the 1984 outing.  2021's version is much more sedated and I think that's a negative for the film.  I don't blame the actors.  I think this is the director's fault.  If it were one or two bad performers, it might be the actors...but this is across the board.  This is direction of performances while filming...or at least what was used in the final edit.  The only actors I felt really played their roles well were Javier Bardem and Jason Momoa.  I felt their hatred and their bravery when they were on screen.  So...maybe Part 2 will be a ""crescendo"" when it comes out.  Maybe Part 1 was meant to be more subdued...to allow emotions to boil and bubble and in Part 2 we'll finally see things burst...at least I hope so.  Dune:  Part 1 is OK.  It's not bad, but it's not as good as it could be.

5.0,"Dune is a modern cinematic masterpiece. I saw Dune in IMAX and there was not a sense left unstimulated. Everything from the sounds to the imagery and the videography was beautifully done. I have not read the book yet so I can't tell you how true it is to it but on an online movie review of Dune, the critic claimes it is quite loyal to the book. A few critiques- Zendaya did not get as much screen time as the advertisements seemed to insinuate. There were several events in the movie that were not fully elaborated on and left you wondering- too much. I think it is also important to note that Frank Herbert's original Dune tells the story of the aristocratic and militaristic Atreties family and the colonization of Arrakis. Paul is most commonly thought of as a colonizer and attempting to be a ""white savior"" but I think the screenwriters and directors did a great job at really making the Fremen more of a focal point than previous renditions of the book and films. Overall, I think Dune is a movie you have to see at least once in your lifetime and I highly recommend seeing it in theatres, specifically IMAX for the full cinematic experience.",Kasey,True,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 22, 2021",Kasey,,Fandango,8f7ebc69-7576-42de-935d-81d8feb5f63b,

4.5,"I remember the first time I saw a painting by Caravaggio. It was ""David With The Head of Goliath."" It was so dark and yet so pristine. I immediately fell in love with his paintings. They exuded a kind of regality while at the same time being enveloped in these deep black backgrounds which seemed so mysterious. This film is the science fantasy version of a Caravaggio painting. It's beautiful yet dark. It's political intrigue guided by high mysticism. It's Dune and it's impossible to turn your eyes away from it. As always I quantify the quality of a film on the five essentials of film making.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Writing:
Dune is ""The Great Gatsby"" of science fantasy. It's one of those novels that it seems is impossible to adapt correctly because it's mostly the author pontificating on lineages, the political histories of various planets and the galaxy they are in, and high mysticism. It's more about the ideals rather than the action. It's hard to make a film about ideals, so what we usually get from adaptations is merely the series of acts that take place in the book. You get all the plot but none of the deeper meaning. This film sadly wasn't that different from the rest. It's hard, but in the end you lose a lot of what makes the book so great. You lose the depth, but in defense of this film it certainly did a better job than any other adaptation. It felt the handling of the Bene Gesserit was better than the Lynch film, and certainly far superior to the Syfy mini series. Where the film fell short I felt was it's handling of House Harkonnen. While fully capturing the fact that Valdimir Harkonnen was evil and repulsive the film played it far to safe to really shock people with how vile this character is in the book. The David Lynch film got a lot closer but didn't do so with the kind of elegance this film had. It was a much glossier take on House Harkonnen and perhaps that's due to not wanting to face cancel culture or alienate a wider audience from the film, but the film suffers from playing it safe. Also, it's an odd structure writing wise. I feel this film should have been at least forty minutes shorter and should have been stretched out into three films instead of two. The film tells the story of one an a half films and that takes away from it was a film.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
2. Direction: 
Denis Villeneuve has woven very tough and stubborn source material into fine silk. This is next level filmmaking. There's only one part where the film falls short as far as direction is concerned and that's the night ambush on the capital of Arrakis. It falls short of the scale and scope it should have had, but even then it makes up for it in the intimate moments between characters. I just wish it had been bigger in scale and had portrayed the kind of scope such a large scale invasion really needed. It's also a part of the film that felt too short. Maybe it should have been stretched out and some of the time between Paul and Jessica in the desert afterwards could have been cut in order to make up for that? Even still that's a small portion in a two and a half hour film. Overall, I would certainly say that any complaints on direction are ultimately just nitpicking.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Acting: 
Absolutely no complaints. There isn't one bad performance in this film. Everyone is portraying fleshed out characters with a full range of emotions and who's motivations are believable. This goes for bit parts and side characters as well. This is an amazing cast worthy of being in a film based on source material of this level of grandeur. I want to highlight some of the more exceptional performances, but to be honest every actor in this film did such a perfect job it's just not fair to do so. Seriously, this is high art in the form of science fantasy.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Visual Elements: 
This is a stunning film. As I said in my opening statement it's a Caragaggio painting in the form of a science fantasy film. It's beautiful. What's really amazing is how so much of the tone of the story is told through the visuals. The Bene Gesserit, The Emperor's Enclave in the beginning, The Harkonnen's, and everything else is just fleshed out perfectly in the costumes and design of the characters. It paints a perfect painting of a world of shadows and light. There's cryptic costume designs, elegant pagentry, monsterous villains, every detail of every character in this film is executed masterfully. The CGI is flawless, just flawless. The technology is far futurism at it's best. Some of the ships are jaw dropping in scale and design. The cinematography is powerful. Visually speaking it's a perfect film.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Score/Soundtrack: 
Another awe inspiring and heart stirring score by Hans Zimmer. Truly one of the greatest film score compossers of all time has created yet another masterpiece. Combining the powerful orchestral elements he's known for as well as exotic rhythms used to build the world of Arrakis. Another masterful score from Hans Zimmer you really don't need to say anthing more than that.

3.0,"Villeneuve's Dune has strong visuals, costumes, and designs. Unfortunately there is not much beyond that. Part One is a lot of setup without the payoff, introducing the story and then ending right as it begins to go somewhere. Pacing throughout is awkward, slow enough to bore in some areas and fast enough to confuse viewers in others with events that are driven by unclear motivations or unexplained background, and confusion is amplified by visions of the future that attempt to add mystery but instead make the movie feel like an extended trailer for Part Two, where all the good stuff will supposedly occur. Having read the book, I understood the events that were happening on screen, but they were laid out in a disorganized way that didn't flow naturally. Rather than being driven by the characters and their motives, the plot felt moved by an outside force that just wanted to hit all the major points from the book. The result is a dizzying string of events with no clear direction or goal (defeat the Harkonnens? prevent the events in Paul's visions? rebuild spice operations? stop the emperor?). There is no arc to the story, no building of anticipation to a climax and resolution, and no time taken to build connections with the characters, so the events carry no weight. The plot is muddled with no milestones to guide its course, a problem enhanced by the decision to split the film into two. While a smart decision due to the density of the source material, the split's execution prevents the first part from standing on its own as a complete film.",Kyle B,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Oct 22, 2021",Kyle B,/user/id/979303862,RT,979303862,

4.5,"After so long of Science-Fiction being a niche prospect, 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey could've been another one of those types to be shelved in cinephile archives and comic-con conventions. Instead it paved the way for more to come like 1977's Star Wars, Blade Runner, Ex Machina, etc. Even before all of them was a peculiar novel by Frank Herbert. Once considered unfilmable, the closest we had was child's play tampered by studio interference (though it had a worthy director in one David Lynch). What better ambassador to achieve the impossible this 21st century than Denis Villeneuve, who resurrected another 80's Sci-Fi property into the mainstream?

With the award-winning aid of writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, Villeneuve's scope translated the first half of the novel with ease. It manages to not fall victim to what some Part 1/Part 2 adaptations have in the past- Actually be a complete story of its own. Sure it does lean a lot into exposition and character development, but they're the best kind. It's also sharpened by the best world-building of Villeneuve's filmography in visuals, organic dialogue and oppressive scope. Hans Zimmer's score feels like a natural progression from his all-encompassing filmography of the 2010's electric synth-waves and earth-shattering vibrations juxtaposed to world beats and Gregorian chants. 

Dune might have one of the biggest feats for an ensemble cast in a long time, and they're all worth the rave. When people look back at which actors exemplified the hottest talent of the Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides has echoes of his 1984 counterpart Kyle MacLachlan, but brings his own spin on the shy warrior. Jason Momoa brings his charisma and sense of humor to Duncan Idaho, Paul's brother. Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's parents bring chilling warmth and anxiety alongside Paul. Stellan Skarsgard's villainous Vladimir Harkonnen is one of several stunning evocations of 1979's Apocalypse Now sprinkled throughout. Josh Brolin is a worthy successor to Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck Dave Bautista and Zendaya are also specialized in their smaller roles, though don't get too excited as they're kept to a minimum. 

Denis' prospect here fulfills his promise to strike the right balance between being blockbuster game and being true to his art-house roots, and the packed theater I was in was great proof of that. Here's to hoping that a Part 2 and what streaming series that may come will complete the cycle in making Frank Herberts' legacy as canonized as the most legendary of book adaptations- The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. Once thought of as unattainable, now only halfway there.

It succeeded at being imaginative in its own right… And being weird; YES, the Dune series is weird, get over it, it just is. It failed at being epic and it failed at creating characters the audience felt connected to. On the over hand, Villeneuve's Dune is the opposite. It's not weird (with one unnecessary exception) but it is epic. It takes unnecessarily long to not get through a simple plot, but we care about the characters.

5.0,"I will do my best to watch Dune on the big screen. I watched it on HBO Max, and it is way to nice to just watch on the small screen.  I have to admit that I did have reservations with the gender swap with the character of Doctor Liet Kynes. However, Sharon Duncan-Brewster made the role her own and did I much more believable job in the role than Max von Sydow or Karel Dobry did in the role as Kynes in their respective versions of Dune. I am not taking anything away from the two actors that came before Sharon Duncan-Brewster, but she nailed it. I can say after watching this version of Doctor Kynes that the gender swap was the right choice. Denis Villeneuve impressed me with his take on the Blade Runner universe and with this movie he knocked it out of the park. If I could pick a director to make my life story into a movie Denis Villeneuve would be the person. Villeneuve made the right choice in breaking the book down into two parts. I just hope the second part lives up to the first part. Timothée Chalamet looks and feels more like the Paul Atreides of the book. He does not come off like the cocky self-righteous Paul Atreides of the other two versions. Zendaya in the role of Chani was off the chain, don't get me wrong I liked Sean Young as Chani in the 1984 Dune and Barbora Kodetova in the 2000 mini-series. Zendaya just had a better script and proved that she could pull off the role. Now on to Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, in all truth, I think he was born to play this role. I have enjoyed his acting in everything from Game of Thrones, to now. The role of Duncan Idaho is his best role to date. I do admit that Momoa without facial hair in later parts of the movie was, let's just say it was just weird.

2.5,"Dune is my favorite book (series), so I had high expectations. The movie started out very well, with the plot and dialogue staying true to the novel. The story was engaging and majestic, staying true to Frank Herbert's vision. Unfortunately, the plot lost momentum by the second half of the movie, turning dull and boring. I felt that those new to the franchise would be extremely confused by what was going on. This movie was primarily created for the Dune fan-base, leaving newcomers confused. I'm also disappointed that they ended in the middle of the first book, without any current funding or concrete filming plans for a sequel. A half-finished work deserves half the stars.

5.0,"I first read the Dune book when i was a teenager and it became probably my favorite book.. It is refreshing to finally see a worthy adaptation. Denis Villeneuve's version of the story is breathtaking with amazing production design and cinematography, which works especially well in the IMAX format... It should definitely be seen at least once in this format, and not on HBO Max, where it will also be released next month. The casting is spot on and the film does an excellent job with the material. The film wisely does not attempt to cover the entire book in the film, stopping around halfway through the source material... and hopefully it will do well enough to get us the promised ""part two"".  The film takes it's time with the narrative, allowing us to experience the water planet of Caladan (played by Norway) before moving to the desert world of Arrakis (played by Jordan and the UAE). The political intrigue and warring great space houses are present but they keep Paul (Timothée Chalamet) center for most of the film.. as we see events through his eyes and his visions of the future hint at what will happen in the second part (as well as some events from the following books).

I was bedazzled by the images...the music with its middle eastern influences and you want more. The best way to qualify a product...it puts you to think...to think how ecological resources are mined out of the expence of nature and the local indigenous people, how the rich and powerful are willing to crush those beneath them and kill among them to become more rich and powerful even and how religious groups within the power spheres create meshias, mythos and prophecies to give the masses something to hope for while they spend their lives serving their masters as disposable tools in their schemes.

Based on the complicated source material, trying to capture the right tone to be true to Herbert's work, it is easy in retrospect to see how it fell into a stylish quagmire of jumbled plot that lost the point.  Villeneuve's Dune balances the mythos and ethereal quality needed for the book's fanbase with a straight forward storyline that is as old as time: greed, lust for power and jealousy, and the willingness to oppress others to achieve and maintain it,  It's a masterful balancing act, and he pulls it off.  It's stunning visually, and the actors own their characters (Jason Momoa made the most of his relatively minor role), but it is only an opening chapter and cannot stand alone as a single movie.

On the heels of reading Frank Herbert's Dune, this movie shocked me throughout at how well it followed the story, portrayed Paul's visions, the political tension, emotion, and even the Voice. The scenes in the movie seem to be follow the book almost bit-by-bit.

Every scene in Dune felt important and the only negative thing I have to say about it is where this film ends.

The cast was immaculate, the acting was amazing, the cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the directing was perfect.

The plot, however, was worryingly bad. For such a big-budget movie with such big-name actors, the plot was lacking. They spent the entirety of the movie building up the sequel, completely throwing away any value the climax would've added. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a professional movie critic or anything, I'm a teenage girl and even I know the movie was objectively bad. We didn't get to see the huge climax of the movie and ‘The Emperor' was in it for one scene. I fell asleep for half an hour of the movie and missed absolutely nothing. It was so slow-moving and the only reason I'd watch it again is to stare at the cast, Zendaya especially in her 10 minutes max of screen time. 

Hugely disappointed with this movie, especially when it was so hyped up because of the cast. It is 100%, not the actor's fault that the movie was bad and the only reason I'm not rating it lower is because of the look of the movie.

5.0,"So to expound a little bit  on the new Dune movie. It is a very faithful reflection of the book, and that is why it's so good. Villeneuve has subtly rammed it with dense references to the source material. Couple bits left out (the dinner party for example) Bombadil style, but he can be forgiven for that. 2.5 hours is a long time and whilst there was a pleasing amount of exposition it literally flew by. My friend sitting next to me (who hadn't read the book) felt the same. I will say perhaps the emotional connection wasn't quite what I'd hoped for - the first half of the book is meant to be quite harrowing, but it is a great and unique movie, that relegates the Lynch version to its deserved place in the dustbin of history. ‘The same feeling as when I saw A New Hope or Fellowship of the Ring?' possibly not, but that could just be the fact that I am older and more jaded. In my opinion however it is the best sci-fi movie since Return of the Jedi in ‘83. But this is different - with Star Wars the source material was thinner and more childlike, here you are adapting what is effectively literature, the pinnacle of the genre and the themes are deeper, darker and more adult - and that's the reason non sci-fi fans should also see it. I don't particularly like RomComs but I love ‘When Harry Met Sally.' Bladerunner 2049 was a visual treat but lacked the resonance of the and source material of the original. Game of Thrones went slowly downhill when it veered from the books. The source material for Dune is arguably best in class and the movie does it justice. It's always good to experience the best in class even if you're unfamiliar with a genre. Villeneuve deserves a lot of credit for this movie.",Ben S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 22, 2021",Ben S,/user/id/979303975,RT,979303975,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/4996459670382974/picture

4.0,"DUNE IS AS MAJESTIC AS THE MAKER SHAI-HULUD
***
I watched it on the 24th of September  in IMAX and it was quite the unique experience. DUNE is unlike anything you have ever watched on the big screen, an experience that stimulates the senses and leaves you pumped up for what's to come.
I even rewatched it in its standard format 2 weeks later. 

Before you keep on reading, many of my notes will be negative and may outweigh the positive ones but I am very orthodox in terms of book-to-film adaptions which is something I advice you not to do because it ruined my experience of DUNE. I will try to review it as objectively as I can. As a fan of the book, the adaptation fell short of capturing the beauty, tension, and complexity of the book. Now does that mean it is bad? NO. Simply, no! As its own entity, DUNE (2021) takes the source material and translates it to the big screen by taking half a book with a structure that is a causal chain of events and tries to morph it into a three-act structure narrative that ticks the boxes of necessary scriptwriting elements. So, independently viewed, DUNE is an excellent cinematic spectacle. Even though this adaptation was generally faithful to the book and included the most necessary scenes, and being a half a book, it failed on expanding or at least properly developing many elements in the story and underutilized many characters. And this was my beef with this adaption, in addition to moments that felt so small when in the book they were much bigger or at least with a larger scope.

I will try to disassociate between book and film as much as possible going further.

In terms of technicalities, Denis Villeneuve is an excellent director. The way he films non-human elements (cities, landscapes…) makes them feel like they have their own personality, breathing with vividness and humanity. The director really knows hot to make the human element active in stories that are de-humanizing or rely on other scopes. Some moments left me with an open jaw for minutes. It's truly a unique cinematic experience formed by a very original story, amazing world-building elements, and production design. Villeneuve could use a lot less cutting and leave a few shots some room to properly breathe because, for 2h 35m that are felt, you would expect a more developed story and not a somewhat rushed one, and really, slowing down some shots and scenes would have helped the film a lot more. The simplest example is the prologue montage which was extremely rushed but I could rewatch it over and over again because it is really awesome.  And kudos to Villeneuve for properly explaining the complex world of DUNE without making the exposition feel out of place.

Denis Villeneuve couldn't have achieved this visual beauty without the Director of Photography Greig Fraser. In terms of visuals, It's not as good as Villeneuve's previous film Blade Runner 2049. Nevertheless, DUNE remains a visual spectacle. 

DUNE's heart is Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides. The film revolves around him even when the scenes are not about him, and this is genius because every single thing in the film serves a purpose in Paul's journey in both Part One and Part Two (as you will see later on). So many small moments were very intimate and precious for our protagonist that will not be fully appreciated until Part Two is released. The story focuses on Paul's Journey and breaks the balance between Politics and the Characters that the novel properly maintained which leaves the politics and the ""events"" of DUNE rather underdeveloped with just barely enough information to understand them and not feel confused. 

DUNE Part One feels like a Part One. It's a movie that will have a sequel. This film is like the first two acts of a story, with Part Two being the third. Nevertheless, DUNE leaves you satisfied and wanting more, not disappointed or cheated. I could compare it to The Fellowship of the Ring but with a few more unresolved plot points.

The film is perfectly cast, which makes me sad to see many characters being under-used or not properly developed. For example, Dr Yueh was barely developed or explored. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen portrayed by the spectacular Stellan Skarsgaard did not get enough time to shine as the rutheless baron he is (in the books). I would've loved to see more of him and many characters like (Gurney Hallec, Piter De Vries, Thufir Hawat, and Beast Rabban). Even Duke Leto, played to perfection by Oscar Isaac could have used more screentime than the time he gets. Now, the existence of a potential Part Two comforts me as we will get to see some of thes characters in more scenes. One of my favorite characters was Liet Kynes portrayed by Sharon Duncan Brewster. Jason Momoa's Duncan Idaho is fun. Rebecca Ferguson as the Lady Jessica is just perfection. I will say the same to all of the cast members. 

The visual effects in this film are really well-done, something you would expect in big-budgeted films. They successfully realized the world of DUNE, showed scale, and brought to life the Shai-Hulud.

The ship design is unlike anything seen in other sci-fi films. I loved the ornithopters, an idea that seems weird on paper but translated beautifully on screen. The entire film has a distinct look that is so alien and futuristic yet grounded in a logical historical progression of humanity's architecture and fashion. The costume design and character's looks are excellent and I would really love to see more of them. I also have to note that DUNE's approach to futurism is considerably more realistic and logical than many films' attempts at it. The production design team nailed it.

And last, but not least, Hans Zimmer. I should've talked about the music earlier but oh dear oh dear, the music. It's a perfect musical score. Please watch DUNE in IMAX or Dolby Atmos. Hans Zimmer is about to grace your ears with glorious music. 

Overall, DUNE was a very good experience that everyone should witness in theaters. I cannot wait for Part Two! And hopefully they get to make the rest of the book series.",Jad S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 22, 2021",Jad S,/user/id/978119048,RT,978119048,

4.0,"One of the most visually stunning movies ever made, Denis Villeneuve remains a visionary with an appealing sense of tone and pacing. The cast shines with no letdowns, overall, this is as great an adaptation of the first half of the first book as one could ask for in film format. That being said, I can't help but feel that Dune may have been even more if it had been a GoT style premium series. There is just as much meat on the bone in terms of political intrigue and a larger universe to explore. This film suffers slightly from the volume of world-building on tap from the books, but generally succeeds spectacularly. I am curious though what those who have never read the books would think, are some areas too vague? Some dialogue too opaque? 

By way of compliments, generally there were few changes from the book, but, when there were they were well done and thoughtful. Did not interrupt the flow and complimented things. 

By way of super-nerd complaints, their water discipline sucked, it was distracting given the heavy importance it is given in the books. Still-suits never seem to be treated as the hyper vital life-lines they are in the books, where even a few breaths without is considered borderline suicidal or offensively wasteful.

5.0,"Review/Rant: Incredible potential to be a franchise that defines a generation. If you understand that going in, then this movie will leave you looking for more. With that being said, there will be many mixed feelings on Dune: Part 1. Here’s why: 1st half of the movie is immersive in every possible way a movie can be. It’s intoxicating. 2nd half hits the breaks, gets tunnel vision and start setting up part two. Lastly and sadly, it’s a 2 1/2 hr and there’s almost 2 generations worth of potential consumers that cannot compute anything over an 1hr 45(unless your parents were OGs and snuck you into lots of the rings as a kid). Acting is an A. Cinematic and music is an A+. The storyline inspired Lucas to make Star Wars, A+. Rhythm is a B since second half felt like a rolling stop. Director did well as we expected but this will be the question moving forward. It opens as a part 1 but there’s no confirmation for a part 2….studio is getting a temperature. Closing thoughts, its the story that inspired the greatest franchise in cinematic history. Movies are about to be a lost art, it sucks and we all know it. I suggest, we all agree that if this franchise gets some breathing room it would be a nice ride into the sunset for us over the next 10 years. Boomers, it’s up to you.

5.0,"From a moderate sci-fi fan who's actually read the book - Denis Villeneuve took great care to honor one of the pillars of world-building sci-if. A huge, complex, and nuanced story requires one of the best story tellers alive, and Villeneuve came through in a big way. For an pic novel like Dune, which has largely been considered ""unfit for film"" due to the complexity of the story and the absolutely terrible 1984 Lynch version where so much of the beauty and nuance of the story was completely destroyed, I was exceedingly nervous about the possibility of a remake. Let me be clear, this is NOT a remake, this is the real deal. Frank Herbert would be proud of what this incredible cast and crew have put forth. Don't believe these movie critic yahoos who never took the time to read one of the greatest and most influential sci-fi novels of all time, this movie is truly incredible from beginning to end. And yes, it is only part of the story - a little over half of the first Dune novel, to be exact.

4.0,"4 out of 5 stars Dune is a beautifully done epic science fiction film that is the start of a new sci fi franchise. Or an attempt to revive one. Even with the opening title saying Dune Part one. I never read the novels. Only knowing the film is the first half of the first Dune novel. Leaving the film with half a story and no climax. Which is frustrating and exciting to see more films. One can hope this film is a success for more. Which it does deserve more films. The plot is good and does open up for an epic story. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) is from the House of Atreides. Which he accompanies his parents to Arrakis which is a homeworld that has spice produced in the desert. Spice can be used for intergalactic travel. House of Atreides is looking for a reasonable peaceful trade. While House of Harkonnen lead by Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) is sending his army to Arrakis for an all out war. The cast ensemble is huge and every one did great playing there characters. Timothee Chalamet taking the main role was phenomenal. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. Along with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa was good. Zendaya is fantastic even if her role was short. But saved for a sequel. Script did a great job with the world building and details on setting up the story. Great with the character building. Even for being a complex book. Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job in making this film a cinematic masterpiece. You can expect great cinematography set up in capturing beautiful landscapes. Visual effects. And having Hans Zimmers music score blasted at a high volume. Every sequence is designed for a cinematic scope to be seen on the big screen at the theatre with a great sound quality. Also, a down side on what you can expect from Denis Villeneuve is the slow pacing. The film does have some action sequences with great visual effects. The giant sandworm sequence is cool. Do not expect any big battle sequences. There is a brief battle scene in a dream sequence that is hinting towards the next film. Positives: the film is a good start for a franchise. The scope with action, visual effects, cast ensemble, production sets, music score, and direction all aims high for a cinematic experience that is epic and loud. It is one spectacular experience. The action sequences were good. Also ending abruptly for more films, do not expect a big climatic battle. Negatives: director Denis Villeneuve is fantastic in making a cinematic visual feast. He does take his time with his storytelling even with a slow pacing. Which he suffers in all his films. Overall, Dune is a good science fiction film which is spectacular and epic.

Much covered by exposition and voice-over in Lynch's version is left out here however on balance I think that's a good thing.

It is such a beautiful film from the cinematography, set design and the wardrobe is so elegant. The casting was stellar; diverse, beautiful and graceful.

Viewers who have never read the book (or those who did not like it) may find it a ponderous, boring exercise, lacking Transformers-like  action or Averngers-like character development (and action), but what is one the screen reflects the book, extremely well.   Remember, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a ponderous boring film often cited today as a classic.

On the downside, I found the ""music"" too much at times, but not nearly as overwhelming as the last Bladerunner film, which are two peas from the same pod musically.

5.0,"I think I have been waiting for this film for much longer than I knew it. It really set up something that I believe will be the next ""Star Wars"" type of hype and following. The characters are refreshing, the story line is amazingly complex and yet subtle and easy to follow if you just accept what you see - allow the visuals to drive your feelings and just know that at it's heart, this is not an agenda pushing film at all - purely driven by a book written years ago - but still rings true in all the passions that we as humans can relate to. 

If I had to pin some stories that resonate and are similar to it, I would mention: Game of Thrones, Battlestar Galactica, The Hunger Games, Star Wars, The Witcher, Mad Max, and oddly enough, Terminator 2. 

Anyway - hands down, it was worth every penny in the theatre and I can't wait for more.

No spoilers in my review but I will say this Dune 84 was a two part film technically. On VHS, it was two seperate tapes. I can see why Villenueve wrote part 1 with part 2 in the works. He did it like a tribute to Lynch's Dune 84. When you watch it you see a some what similar connection, but wow!!! I want to watch this again and again! Villenueve hit a home run with this movie!!

Most Scifi films even Alien or whatever are tough to watch and you get bored easily, most don't really explain too well how things happened precisely.

4.5,"First things first: This is a film for the BIG screen, even though it's already streaming. Do yourself that favor, the scenes flying ornithopters on Arrakis (among others) are just SO beautifully shot by Denis Villeneuve. The story covers in about the same runtime only half of the David Lynch-version from 1984 and clearly closes as a first part. The vibes of the film are quite different from the former in exchanging art deco for bunker feeling. As in the older version, lots of people die, and not just redshirts, so don't get attached to certain beloved characters/actors. Talking about acting: the stellar cast lives up to its promise. Just a hint for the ladies, though: If you want to keep your Aquaman/GOT-image of Jason Momoa, you might want to skip this film. He looks very different clean-shaven. And a hint for guys: Zendaya has very little screen time, unfortunately.

2nd helping: Watching this great film once more, I paid extra attention to the intense score written by Hans Zimmer. This is not your regular soundtrack, at times it feels rather like a staccato to only highlight certain scenes, with long times of musical silence in between. I also noticed that I kind of missed the inner thoughts of certain characters (which were audible in the 1984 version) more than the first time, although that is one of the main flaws of the old version in many people's opinion.

5.0,"This is a groundbreaking saga in the making, one sci-fi fans were hungrily waiting for. The world building here is masterful, and if you like Villeneuve's style, you'll probably like this. Its also quite clear he tried to please a bigger audience and went for a more direct style than, say, Blade Runner 2049. I myself prefer his ""don't tell, show"" storytelling of previous movies more, but i can see why he seeked more balance regarding this (Blade Runner was a box office failure after all). If this is what it takes to reach a bigger audience and make a sequel possible, I'm perfectly ok with it, because it still manages to make you get youself fully immersed. 

Watch it in IMAX, if possible. Its a treat to the senses, and it makes a huge part of the experience, especially because it's a slow burning movie. I can understand why the director didn't want it to premiere in streaming platforms along with the theaters.

I find book fans will be pleased, since the adaptations made are understandable and doesn't hurt whats crucial to the story. But the amazing thing here is that Villeneuve made a DUNE movie that appeals to people who haven't read it. And that in itself is an enormous achievement, since book fans know it's a rather dry and detached read. To make it pleasing, even in the slightest, is great filmmaking.

If you don't like slowburning movies, i'm afraid this isn't for you. It's not really a matter of good taste, but simply a preference, and I fully understand it. But if you want to see an entire universe being brought alive vividly right in front of your eyes in its own time, than I think you should hop in and enjoy the ride.

3.5,"The movie that everyone has been waiting to see and find out…does it live up to the hype? A simple answer would be, “A little but not a lot.” Dune is a fascinating spectacle with amazing cinematography. It’s visually amazing. Brings you back to the time that Avatar took control of cinema with its visuals back in 2009. But to stay on track, Dune is a movie filled with great characters, stunning visuals, an amazing story that is just left unfinished. Speaking of our characters, this movie is led by Timothée Chalamet who does well leading this movie. Our other cast members in this film do an amazing job with what is given to them but many times you are left with saying, “Is that it for this character? Really?!” Or “Well I guess I’ll see them in a sequel.” A feeling of wanting more from this film is a heavy thought that I am left with after watching. The story is so dense and sometimes can be convoluted with information hitting you left and right if not knowing everyone’s name or the slightest detail of facts that have been shared dealing with the conflicts of House Atreides and House Harkonnen and many others. This movie is a slow burn with a “spice” of action being sprinkled in between. But that part doesn’t disappoint at all. As it is shot beautifully by director Denis Villeneuve. Dune is an intriguing movie that leaves you just wanting more. A lot more. It just feels unfinished. Leaving you salivating for a sequel that may or may not happen. It just feels incomplete. But here I am thinking of what to praise it for other than it’s amazing visuals. It’s hard to give praise to this movie even though it clearly deserves it given the fact who directed. But that feels impossible when Dune (a dense movie) leaves so many questions unanswered and leaves you with a, “come back for more in the sequel” ending to leave off on. Dune might be a movie for you but not for all. I think it just might do it’s due diligence to its fans of the book but that just might be it. For me Dune is a fun movie that maybe down the line after it’s sequels (hopefully) I can comeback to this movie and say I absolutely love it. But for now Dune is just a fun time for this movie junkie. Dune gets a 3.5/5 Stars ⭐️ @MylesEd33",,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 22, 2021",,,Flixster,90861cd1-7dec-416b-9fb7-f0c65db19404,

Takes its time but never moves tooooo slowly (until the somewhat lifeless ending, which is ""only the beginning""). Wisely covers only about the first half of the first book, which allows for much greater clarity but  may frustrate audiences expecting resolution.

5.0,"Amazing movie. This one should be experienced in a movie theater with a crystal clear screen and a good sound system. One would have fun seeing it on TV but one would have more fun in a really large screen, immersing oneself in the spectacle.

Chalamet is amazing. I see him in photos and I don't get the feeling that he is someone who will ""make"" me go see his movies. Not like a Denzel Washington or an Al Pacino or even a Stellan Skarsgard would. However he is doing amazing things with his facial expressions, ""saying"" things just by moving these muscles. The Gom Jabbar scene is a good example of this. Same thing applies with Zendaya. I see her in photos, and I am ""meh"". Nevertheless, she is a goddess in this movie.

Oscar Isaac's scene without clothes is definitely a tribute to something else. Some painting? Some other movie? I don't know. It is an aesthetically pleasant scene nevertheless. Skarsgard's first appearance, is also a tribute to Marlon Brando (you will understand what when you see it). The movie is full of memorable emblematic icons. Were I to see some of the clothes/uniforms on the cover of a scifi comic, I would definitely pick it up to check it inside. Skarsgard, Brolin, Momoa, Bautista are  fun to behold. Bardem is quite unrecognizable under his make up, but he is also working wonders. The only one who did not make an impression as an actress, who I thought that ""it doesn't matter who is portraying her"" was Charlotte Rampling. Maybe because of her costume and the fact that it was difficult to distinguish her facial expressions.

In general the images were so impressive that I will check the Villeneuve films I have not seen yet (he is truly an auter) and I will delve into Craig Fraser's (director of photography) works. Simply amazing.

I have already seen it twice in cinema (it opened in Greece on October 14th) and have plans to see it again. In cinema. I cannot stress enough the importance of viewing it on a movie theater. It has to be experienced there with the sound blasting from the speakers. It is one of those movies.

Dune is just great. Now, is it the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, not even close but this film is definitely a great sci-fi epic.
Timothee Chalamet is excellent as Paul, I haven't really seen him in much so I didn't know how good at acting he is and this performance shows that he can act. I am excited to see his performance in The French Dispatch. The worms are awesome and giant. The worms are really cool.
Denis Villeneuve is an amazing director. Dune is beautiful. I love how it is directed, the shots are so well done, some shots are taken from above, some for a distance and many shots are just beautiful. The color grading is great, the cinematography is phenomenal, some of the best I have seen in the while and the editing is impressive. The space shots were really cool and well done. I am surprised that this movie only cost 165 million dollars to make.
I thought the plot was pretty easy to follow most of the time. The spaceships were very cool looking and the helicopter was really interesting. I thought that Oscar Isaac, Zendaya and Stellan Skarsgård's performance were pretty good. My biggest complaint is that I wish some of the side characters like Jason Momoa, Dave Batista and Josh Brolin's characters could of been more developed and this film felt like a lot of context setting up Part 2.

2.0,"Pretentious. My friend warned me as soon as he saw the director was Denis Villeneuve that the movie would be chock full of slow-mo pauses and camera pans. The entire movie could be described as 1-2 minutes of real speed action/talk followed by 30-60 seconds of slow pause...pan. Even during conversations, the characters take an inordinate amount of time to speak so they can soak-up the dramatic pause. It's absolutely tedious. The movie LOOKS great. I don't have any major objections to the dialogue or tweaks to the plot (I have them, but they aren't game breaking). However, I cannot fathom paying to see this movie. Imagine Zach Snyder taking his slo-mo action style but applying it to EVERY. SINGLE. SHOT. of the movie. Two stars for the excellent costume design. Other issues: the sand worms rise to the top of the sand on their approach, then they what? dive hundreds of meters below so as to come up directly beneath their prey? How does that work? How does one explain worm riding if the worms don't breach...ever...they just swallow their ""prey"" from directly below? Another oddity was seeing the Harkkenon fleets ""leaving"" Arrakis but their ships were oriented upside down vis-a-vis the planet whose orbit they just left. In any case, those are relatively minor issue. The big problem is the pretentious still frames, slow pans, and ""deep, solemn"" pauses. Just run all the slo-mo at regular speed and you'd fit the entire novel into a 2.5 hour movie. Gone is the majority of the philosophical critique that dominates the novel, replaced by dramatic pause after dramatic pause. Do yourself a favor, read the book and then watch the Scy-Fy Channel miniseries. It's much more true to the spirit of the book.

Saying that the movie does a nice job explaining things without exposition (The first Dune (1984) had way too much exposition). It even explains things a bit more logically considering the condensed material, as they eliminated major plots\characters. Unfortunately this movie leaves out critical details, like a lasguns effect on a Holtzman field (shield). We have scenes were lasguns are used with impunity. In other scene we see what looks like cluster bombs. Their are a couple of more faults along this line (would it kill you to explain who is Thufir Hawat, or what a Mentat is, ) which I will not go into, but you know their are issues if you have not read the book and you're left scratching your head wondering why they are not using the lasers to kill everyone.

5.0,"Dune is a universal epic that does what movies do best. It takes us away to a place inside ourselves. Dune is a sci fi film set in a universe where computers were banned long ago. Machinations of noble houses govern the pattern of galaxies. It’s a dangerous place where The Confederation of Great Houses balances itself against the power of the Emperor. Everyone is grasping for a psychedelic substance called Spice, found only on the sands of Arakis. Spice’s power is harnessed by three factions. Mentats specialize in computation, and strategy. They assist the great houses as advisors. Bene Geserit Witches spend their lives training to understand humans our emotions, our motivations, and our weaknesses. The Navigators Guild is the group that facilitates space travel. Without them, no one could travel between planets. All three groups require Spice, and everyone would do anything to secure it.
     In this movie, the heads of two great houses are pitted against each other. Duke Leto Atreides, played by Oscar Iasic, inspires loyalty in his followers. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, played by Stellan Skarsgård, rules with cruelty. Skarsgård needs only a few lines to make you wish he’d evaporate in a horrible death, but the Hollywood gods aren’t so kind. His Baron Harkonnen is equal parts haunting, and pitiful. 
    More important than politics to this movie, though, is physical ecology. Location guides the path of your experience through the nearly 3 hour runtime. Living setting, not plot or character, is the most important aspect of Dune. And this setting does not disappoint. Filmed in The United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Jordan this gigantic project immerses you in its global scale. From the rocky coastlines of Caladan to the haunting desert moons of Arrakis our characters are just specks on a larger horizon. Specks they might be, but they’re specks that you’ll love, and you’ll hate, Graphic effects, supervised by Paul Lambert, take you past the screen. In his department’s hands sand splashes like water in the wake of  Arakas’s Giant Worms. They make moons hovering above the horizon, and the blue on blue eyes of Fremen equally stupefying. 
      Timothée Chalamet does Frank Herbert’s Paul Atredies justice. He casts a regal shape that inspires hope, and curiosity. As the main character, he moves through each decision with restraint, and implicit capability. He’s assisted by his mother, a trained Bene Gesserit. Your heart will be touched by the mother’s love that’s shown by Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Fergison. Tears might even touch your cheeks as you watch her guide her son on the rough dessert planet of Arrakis. Among the Atreides staff, Duncan Idaho, played by Jason Mamoa, is a shining gem. In this performance, Mamoa combines solderly kindness with barely controlled beastliness to grant his character a screen-grabbing magnetism. Duncan Idaho will be one of your favorite characters. That’s saying something with this all-star cast. Sharon Duncan Brewster is perfectly cast as Ecologist Leit-Kines. She will leave you knowing that there’s a hidden depth to her story as great as an entire Lawrence of Arabia. 
    Every element combines in this film to give you the best movie experience this side of the century. You should try to remember who you were before you went into the theater, because you’re not going to leave it as exactly the same person. At Dune’s core is the importance of honor, and responsibility. You’ll be reminded to be a better man. Dune will inspire you to believe that this is a thing worth doing. You’ll stand straighter, you’ll look further, and you’ll wish the rest of the world would see what you just saw.",Joe Mayurnick,True,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 22, 2021",Joe Mayurnick,,Fandango,0945B7D4-FD99-46D4-9251-AF2558DEF48D,

2.5,"Jason Momoa can't seem to deliver a line without mumbling or sounding like he's in a damned SoCal buddy comedy, Josh Brolin- who I normally find to be a good actor- had a similar issue with line delivery. Timothee Chalamet was far too awkward in a very uncharming way, and his delivery was a bit mumbly at times as well. And just once I'd like to see desert dwellers not modeled after Arabic cultures on planet Earth... oh wait, David Lynch already avoided that trite pitfall in the original Dune picture!

I really wanted to like this, and it's not all bad- Javier Bardem and almost all of the Fremen actors do quite well- but I'm scratching my head at some of these casting choices.  I will say that Stellan Skarsgard did a good job as Baron Harkonnen for the most part- but again, Lynch's Baron- reveling in disease and foul industrial imagery- paints such a more fascinating picture of the nature of the Harkonnen savagery and disgust.

The one thing that I cannot forgive though is the rushed and absurdly soft take on the ""box of pain"" scene. I've never seen less character development or less intensity in a scene like that. It is unforgivable and baffling to me why it was done so weakly...

There are a lot of very questionable line deliveries that do not make for an immersive experience. Much of the acting seems forced and incompatible, as though the cast was not absorbed in the moment of the picture. The accents and diction of speech were inconsistent across the actors- like there was no attempt to make each group sound like they're from the same place... It also felt emotionally piecemeal and incongruent for most of the picture. This is extremely disappointing, and all of the visual grandeur is meaningless if you don't have appropriate acting. It feels like they lost sight of that.

It also felt like a lot of the effects were after-thoughts- the voice of the Bene Gesserit order was not very compelling compared to our original frame of reference that was Lynch's incredible sound-design. I know people are going to say that we ought to avoid comparing the two films, but guess what, that is inevitable and the only reason people say that is because they know this picture will fall short of the images and sounds of Lynch's film.

4.5,"​Frank Herbert's originally published sci-fi novel titled Dune was noted as the Best-Selling Sci-fi novel in the world in 2003. It has sold over 20 Million copies worldwide. It is a story that has been described as incorporating politics, religion, ecology, technology and human emotion. It is a story, and a movie, that will keep you waiting anxiously for the next scene, the evolution of the story line and resolution of the ever-expanding conflicts constantly developing on the big screen. The simple fact being that the 2 hour and 35-minute epic will have you wanting the story to continue beyond the finality of The End appearing on the screen. Your vocabularies will increase to include Arrakis (the planet on which the story will evolve), Mélange ( the drug spice that can only be found on Arrakis and which extends life and enhances mental acuity), Bene Gesserit ( a secret society of women), Sand Worms ( Giant inhabitants of Arrakis) and Freman (the inhabitants of the planet Arrakis). This is a fascinating story of power sought and mystical realities influencing control of the universe and all its inhabitants. The expansion of comparisons to a contemporary society are inevitable and realistic. Accept the fact that Sci-Fi and drama are NOT mutually exclusive and that the bestselling Sci-Fi novel of all time may have a compelling story line worth the time you invest in this big screen spectacular.  One might hope that the sequel to the 2021 Dune will not take the 5 years of negotiations and development that the 2021 final production took before sharing this epoch with an appreciative audience.

4.0,"I just finished watching Dune Movie at AMC Tyngsboro and visually this movie is very stunning. I went it a blank slate not knowing anything about the Frank Herbert stories so that I can see for myself as to what kind of film this is going to be. This film felt very much like John Carter of Mars meets Star Wars series meets Shakespeare's Hamlet and Romeo & Juliet into one giant story. It's very much about accepting your birthright and Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides has this inner conflict whether to take his father's throne or become the messiah by saving Arrakis, the borderline uninhabitable desert world where spice is found. Spice is the income that keeps the House of Atreides in power or it could destroy them if they fail in their duties. The main catalyst is Paul Atreides and the conflict he goes through which is explored throughout this first part of the story. I will say Chalamet's performance is great and again just brings depth and dimension to the role. The central storyline with his character is that he felt betrayed by his mom and is having a tough time accepting her apology. That's the main focus of this story which leads dangerous journeys on the deserts of Arrakis. Even the battle between Harkonnens and Atreides builds some astonishing visuals where some are beautiful and others are just horrifying all these are fun to watch on a big screen. The grand scale look is what I take away from this film and whether it gets a sequel is a question since it depends on the success of the first film. I want this film to succeed so that Denis Villeneuve gets to continue the stories of Frank Hubert.

There's hardly any sense of forward momentum, and the exciting scenes are quickly undercut by long slo-mo dream sequences and sweeping landscape shots. Also don't love Chamalet in this role as Paul Atreides, it just feels like he has one expression and one tone of voice for the entire film—he's just boring to watch unfortunately.

1.5,"So, I have seen the new DUNE. I am impressed at the production. Yet, it has deviated from the books greatly in just the first half of the first book. With 6 books in the DUNE series not going into prequels there is a lot to look forward to. To change so quickly into a set story line, means the changes will only get worse. Some storyline features were done perfectly, like battle language, thopters resembling bugs and others. Yet the changes will ultimately destroy the storyline irreparably. Feyd was never introduced, Paul's training and skills was skipped over, weirding way training was ignored, Thufir's sound weapons also ignored. Vast amounts of backstory and intellectual understanding left out. Nothing about the navigators or history leading to present day politics. . . . . . . As visually entertaining as this movie is, it comes off as a poor cliff notes version of a monumental storyline. The 1984 version did the best it could with the technology of film and limited time constraints, but it had more quality and loyalty to the books, which even Herbert said he loved it. The 2000 miniseries was the truest to the books, yet visually limited by budgets. This ultimately falls into the category of books that cannot be put into film properly, or at the least the production company capable still does not exist. I enjoyed it at several points but continued to be disappointed more over. See the movie, but be aware it is not DUNE, it is a reinvention.

I'm sure anyone that's read the novel may have a better understanding of wtf was happening, but to me, this was a long dragged out middle episode of a series I wasn't following.

All the visions - of which most were tacky, really resolved to nothingness. I know this is only supposed to be the first part of two, but leaving the viewer with not much to root for or care about, does not make an inviting viewing to any part 2.

I also found Timothée Chalamet annoying as his character. Not sure why, but he didn't convince me.

Although the score was typical ""Hans Zimmer"" amazing, I had difficulty understanding most of the dialogue when it was mixed in with the score.

I’ve never heard anything like it and it gives the movie a certain tone that can be unsettling at times but is overall a joy to watch and listen to.

I do wish we got a bit more in Paul’s headspace for his arcs sake, but so much of his arc is incomplete it’s hard to judge yet on that front. A lot I think will depend on the next movie.

From its most complex layers, to the simplest ones... From the most joyful or deeply human moments, to the most horrible or deeply inhuman moments. Sometimes raw and dark as life can be, sometimes wonderful and magical as life can be...

A universal saga in infinitely more ways than one... A mythology filled with values and philosophies colliding with one another... A multiplicity of beliefs, where certainties and uncertainties are entwined with one another, like two inseparable snakes seeking each other without ever finding each other...

Mystical and evanescent, as well as concrete and visceral... Dreams and premonitions, choices and actions, space and time... Or where the role that you play is written but is not, has already taken place but never will...

A cinematographic fresco that is immensely majestic and glorious like the greatest of paintings or the greatest of concertos...

... It answers everything while questioning you about everything, because it is simply giving you the pure truth.

PS : From the entire casting and their performances, to the cinematography+photography+design & visual language as a whole, to the action+choregraphy+music+costumes, the staging and overall atmosphere, the lore/world building, its entire mythology (and its codes), with countless messages and layers...

A captivating sci-fi story that mixes politics, eye popping technology, gorgeous visual FX, and a rock solid cast.Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides, played by Oscar Isaac. The Atreides are a powerful family within the galaxy and as such, the emperor has given them the planet of Arrakis, a dessert planet that's home to the most precious commodity in the galaxy: spice. However, Arrakis is already being ruled and plundered by the Harkonnen family, thus making the two families enemies when the emperor takes it away from the Harkonnen's to gift to the Atreides. The Fremen or natives on Arrakis live underground, is home to dangerous sand worms, and is so hot that without the proper equipment and water, people die rather quickly. The Harkonnen's ravaged the planet for its resources and paid no attention to the Fremen; however, now with the Atreides in power, they wish to make peace with the them. Very impressive performances all around, especially in regards to the mother/son duo of Chalamet, who is very mature for a 26-year-old actor and Rebecca Ferguson.

What may turn viewers off is a lack of greater character depth, and perhaps more screentime for some characters.

5.0,"Duna é a combinação perfeita entre a técnica primorosa de Denis Villeneuve e a genialidade de Frank Herbert. Apesar de ser uma adaptação (e apenas da primeira parte do romance de 1965), Duna (2021) mantém o espírito do livro, pois trata o material base com extremo respeito.

5.0,"Epic! Accurate to the book, which I did not *need* but it was nice. I got chills many times. Long but I'm glad as I never wanted it to end! It seemed to be about 1/2 of Dune book 1 of the 6 books series. The only negatives: (1) They could have edited out a few wasteful scenes or moments. (2) The music was a bit jarring at times. Not quite up to the near perfection of the old David Lynch Dune's sound track.
I was worried they would ""wokenize"" the film but really all they did was replace a few white characters with black ones and none of that seemed out of place. Maybe a bit of forced environmentalism and anti-colonialism but not so much that it spoiled the film",Scott S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 21, 2021",Scott S,/user/id/254caf12-bf6d-4c15-a431-1289d68f8a01,RT,254caf12-bf6d-4c15-a431-1289d68f8a01,

3.5,"While the movie is certainly a visual masterpiece, the empty characters are the major weakness of this movie. In David Lynch's Dune, Paul's internal struggle and fears were due to his soliloquy more palpable. Now it all depends on Timothee's capacilities to act and he disappoints. But worse of it all, the Harkonnen, who  represented the ultimate evil quite convincingly in 1984, are now merely a bunch of bad guys - but nothing more. If the saying that a movie is always as good as its villains was ever true, this is no good news for this Dune adaptaion. Still, the movie entertains during the first 1.5 hours and only becomes a bit long-winded in the last hour. Still looking forward for the second part, since - if ironing out some of these deficits - it could become the desired masterpiece of Villeneuve.",Benjamin B,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 21, 2021",Benjamin B,/user/id/Google_107010342906984359775,RT,Google_107010342906984359775,

4.5,"A sci-fi epic with great effects, cinematography, world-building, and score.

5.0,"Dune has long thought to be unadaptable. Then came the announcement that Denis Villeneuve would direct a new adaption as part of a two part film, as the book was too big to fit into one movie. Which is true, just look at David Lynch's version. Originally supposed to release in December 2020, it was delayed to September/October in 2021, and now we finally have it.

The result? A cinematic masterpiece. I had very few doubts about this movie, but I was a bit afraid that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, being a huge fan of the books. Oh, but it most certainly did. It exceeded my expectations by a mile, so much so that I watched it three times in the theater, and I would certainly like to again.  I've seen some people thinking the movie is boring, but this isn't your run of the mill action-adventure flick, and it's not supposed to be. It's a faithful adaption of the highest selling Sci-fi novel (in paperback).  There aren't action scenes with quips around every corner. However, when there is action, oh it's beautiful. Duncan Idaho carries these action sequences with excellent fight scenes that make you fall in love with his badassery.

This is a more serious Sci-fi Epic that explores the politics of Dune, the culture of the fremen, and prophecy of the Bene Gesserit. The movie takes it's time (rightfully) to invite you into a rich, exciting world with great detail and lore. We follow Paul Atreides through his journey from his home planet Caladan into the desert of Arrakis as he is thrust into this generation long prophecy, alongside his Bene Gesserit mother, the Lady Jessica, who is a real badass. And Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Paul. Some scenes have been left out from the book, but that's to be expected. And the cinematography, visuals and score in this movie are off the charts. This movie needs to be seen in a theater.    
 
Since this is only part one, the movie kind of does end abrubtly, but this isn't really a bad thing when you know it's only the first part. The only problem is you want more. And hopefully part two happens. Please Warner Bros. Greenlight Part 2.
